32,1," This view has been approved in the Second Circuit in Rutkin v. Reinfeld , 2 Cir. 1956, 229 F.2d 244, 252. "
40,1," .  The following subsidiaries of Carvel Corporation, a New York corporation, are defendants in these cases: Carvel Stores of 
New York, Inc., a New York corporation; Carvel Dari-Freeze Stores, Inc., a New York corporation; Carvel Stores Realty 
Corporation, a New York corporation, now known as Chain Locations of America, Inc.; Carvehicle Corporation, a New York 
corporation; and Carvel Stores of Pennsylvania, a Pennsylvania corporation.  The name 'Carvel' is used in this opinion as a 
general term of reference for any or all of the foregoing companies."
40,2," .  The non-Carvel corporate defendants consist of the following companies: Eagle Cone Corporation, a New York corporation; 
H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation; Mohawk Container Company, Inc., a New York corporation; and 
Rakestraw's Dairy Products, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation.  The non-Carvel corporate defendants are referred to in this 
opinion as the supplier defendants."
40,3," .  The actions as against these individuals, Thomas Carvel, Fred Vettel, Jr., George P. Clark, Robert J. Shallis, Agnes Carvel, 
Darrow Nutt, Ann M. McHugh, Stanley W. Townsend, Bruce Carvel, Mildred Arcadipane and Richard A. Cerosky, were 
dismissed by the Court on motion at the end of the case on the ground that no basis for any individual liability had been shown 
by the plaintiffs' evidence.  The actions were also dismissed against Philip Agree and Arthur Marciante, former attorneys for 
Carvel. "
43,4," .  Hodd delivered Carvel Mix to the stores of the plaintiffs in Massachusetts and Connecticut and Rakestraw made delivery to 
the plaintiffs located in Pennsylvania."
43,5," .  The contracts of Eagle Cone Corporation and Mohawk Container Co. contained no provision that these companies would not 
sell the operators non-Carvel approved merchandise and the plaintiffs failed to prove that any such policy existed independent of 
the contracts. "
44,6," .  Modick, Ossola, Phelan, Pierce, Rodens, Seu, Pazdro and Giberman.  (The cases involving the plaintiffs Pierce, Mueller, 
Frederick and Rodens, which were begun in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, were consolidated before being transferred to 
this court.  This accounts for the reference to twelve names of plaintiffs in the nine cases covered by this opinion). "
45,7," .  It is not altogether clear in Carvel's arrangements with its operators what the tying device may be considered to be and what 
product or products are alleged to be tied in.  Logically the franchise, which is basic to the entire operation, or the dispensing 
freezers sold by Carvel, would seem to be the tying articles with the mix and accessory products tied in.  Plaintiffs in their post 
trial brief do not assert that the franchise is a tying device but advance the theory that in addition to the freezers the front 
assembly plate for the freezers (which happens to be pattented and which is leased to the operators) is a tying article.  This 
attempt to bring in an incidental patented article as a tying device as to which 'dominance' may be presumed is unrealistic and 
cannot be accepted.  This opinion proceeds on the basis of plaintiffs' other contention that the dispensing freezers sold by 
Carvel are the tying articles. "
46,8," .  See Standard Oil Co. v. FTC, 273 F. 478, at 481, 17 A.L.R. 389 (2d Cir. 1921) --  'It is unfair and dishonest to give out from a 
pump bearing one brand another maker's oil * * *.' "
47,9," .  Both forms of franchise agreement permitted the operator to install one soft drink cup dispensing machine and one cigarette 
vending machine at the outside of the store only."
47,10," .  As with tie-ins, a number of cases have held certain kinds of exclusive dealing arrangements to be illegal.  Standard Fashion 
Co. v. Magrane-Houston Co., 258 U.S. 346, 42 S.Ct. 360, 66 L.Ed. 653 (1922) (agreement requiring purchaser of dress patterns 
not to deal in patterns of the seller's competitor); F.T.C. v. Motion Picture Advertising Service Co., 344 U.S. 392, 73 S.Ct. 361, 
97 L.Ed. 426 (1953) (contract prohibiting showing of competitors films); Dictograph Products v. F.T.C., 217 F.2d 821 (2d Cir. 
1954), cert. denied, 349 U.S. 940, 75 S.Ct. 784, 99 L.Ed. 1268 (1955) (restricting hearing aid dealers from selling products of 
competitors). "
48,11," .  One complained of his inability to sell hamburgers; one complained that he could not use the premises to sell Christmas 
trees. "
50,12," .  The plaintiffs in the Susser, McCoy, Mueller and Frederick cases are in this category.  (Although the date of the plaintiff 
Rodens' franchise agreement is April 11, 1955, the form of the agreement is that which was stipulated to have been used by 
Carvel after May 1, 1955)."
50,13, .  The relevant dates in these four cases are as follows: Plaintiff Date of Franchise Susser
50,7, /17/54 McCoy
50,10, /30/54 Mueller
50,2, /24/54 Frederick 
51,2, /11/53
51,14, .  None of the supplier defendants relies on this defense.
51,15," .  See Fleischer v. A.A.P., Inc., 180 F.Supp. 717 (S.D.N.Y.1959). "
52,16," .  See Momand v. Universal Film Exchanges, 172 F.2d 37, 49 (1st Cir. 1948)."
52,17," .  It may be noted that although franchise agreements of the type involved in this case have seldom figures in antitrust opinions, 
the general legal conclusions arrived at in this opinion regarding the legality of Carvel's method of conducting its business 
operations are supported by the recent decision of the United States District Court for the District of Kansas in the case of 
Engbrecht v. Dairy Queen Company of Mexico, Missouri, 203 F.Supp. 714. That case, which involved franchise agreements 
closely analagous to those at issue here, held that the provisions in those agreements were not in violation of the antitrust laws. 
In addition, the court there found that the defendant did not fix the prices at which Dairy Queen products were sold to the public. "
58,1," .  Service of process in this suit was made on only two individuals, Charles J. Beasley and Walton S. Smith."
58,2," .  This suit is the reinstitution of a similar action which was dismissed by the District Court without prejudice for failure to comply 
with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b), 28 U.S.C.A., which is as follows: '(b) Secondary Action by Shareholders. In an action brought to enforce a secondary right on the part of one or more 
shareholders in an association, incorporated or unincorporated, because the association refuses to enforce rights which may 
properly be asserted by it, the complaint shall be verified by oath and shall aver (1) that the plaintiff was a shareholder at the 
time of the transaction of which he complains or that his share thereafter devolved on him by operation of law and (2) that the 
action is not a collusive one to confer on a court of the United States jurisdiction of any action of which it would not otherwise 
have jurisdiction.  The complaint shall also set forth with particularity the efforts of the plaintiff to secure from the managing 
directors or trustees and, if necessary, from the shareholders such action as he desires, and the reasons for his failure to obtain 
such action or the reasons for not making such effort.' "
61,3," .  A preliminary hearing was held by the District Court on the question of intimidation.  Plaintiff was ordered to produce evidence 
in support of such allegations.  He failed to submit clear evidence and admitted his inability to support such allegation which was 
thereupon excluded from consideration on the defendants' motions for dismissal.  Rogers v. American Can Co., 187 F.Supp. 
532, 534-535 (D.N.J.1960). "
62,4, .  The opinion of the District Court is reported in 187 F.Supp. 532.
62,5," .  Of the 766,276 shares which were voted, proxies for 406,650 were held by management of M & T proxies for 186,929 shares 
were held by plaintiff's proxy committee and 172,697 shares held by Canco were represented by special agents in person. At the time of the 1958 election, plaintiff, his family and associates owned or controlled 20.3 percent of the stock of M & T as 
against 22.3 percent held by Canco and the individual defendants."
62,6," .  The nine directors consisted of the eight individual defendants and Garfield L. Miller, Jr.  The plaintiff, Leslie C. Rogers and 
John F. Condon were the three candidates on the plaintiff's proxy committee slate who were elected. "
63,7," .  Equity Rule 94 (104 U.S. ix) was adopted immediately after the Supreme Court decided the Hawes case (104 U.S. 450, 26 
L.Ed. 827, 1882). It was modified slightly in 1912 when Equity Rule 27 was promulgated.  These attempts to regulate the 
resolution of derivative shareholders' suits in federal courts culminated in present Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b).  The 
decision in the Hawes case and the promulgation of Rule 94 and its successors were designed to limit the jurisdiction of federal 
courts to bona fide cases of diversity and to inhibit the threatened increase in volume of suits collusively seeking the jurisdiction 
of the courts of the United States since the decision in Dodge v. Woolsey, 18 How. 331, 59 U.S. 331, 15 L.Ed. 401 (1956). See 3 
Moore, Federal Practice, § 23.15, at 3489-3493 (2 ed. 1948)."
63,8," .  Rule 94 provides as follows: 'Every bill brought by one or more stockholders in a corporation, against the corporation and other parties, founded on rights 
which may properly be asserted by the corporation, must be verified by oath, and must contain an allegation that the plaintiff was 
a shareholder at the time of the transaction of which he complains, or that his share had devolved on him since by operation of 
law; and that the suit is not a collusive one to confer on a court of the United States jurisdiction of a case of which it would not 
otherwise have cognizance.  It must also set forth with particularity the efforts of the plaintiff to secure such action as he desires "
64,," on the part of the managing directors or trustees, and, if necessary, of the shareholders, and the causes of his failure to obtain 
such action.' "
66,9," .   Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 8 F.Supp. 893 (N.D.Ala.1934); 9 F.Supp. 800 (N.D.Ala.1935); 9 F.Supp. 965 
(N.D.Ala.1935)."
66,10," .  Tennessee Valley Authority v. Ashwander, 78 F.2d 578 (5 Cir. 1935). "
67,11," .  On final hearing the bill was dismissed for laches.  Kessler & Co. v. Ensley Co., 141 F. 130 (N.D.Ala.1905), aff'd 148 F. 1019 
(5 Cir. 1906), cert. denied 205 U.S. 541, 27 S.Ct. 788, 51 L.Ed. 921 (1907). "
69,12," .  The court relied in part on the authority of the English case of Foss v. Harbottle, 2 Hare 461, reference to which is also made 
in Hawes v. Oakland, 104 U.S. 450, 454, 26 L.Ed. 827. The court in Continental Securities Co. v. Belmont, 206 N.Y. 7, 99 N.E. 
138, 51 L.R.A.N.S., 112 (1912) specifically declared that its decision was not in conflict with Hawes v. Oakland. "
70,13," .  The second sentence of paragraph (b) provies: 'The complaint shall also set forth with particularity the efforts of the plaintiff to secure from the managing directors or trustees 
and, if necessary, from the shareholders such action as he desires, and the reasons for his failure to obtain such action or the 
reasons for not making such effort.'"
70,14," .  Section 30 of the New Jersey General Corporation Act of 1896, Laws 1896, c. 185, provided as follows: 'No corporation shall make dividends, except from the surplus or net profits arising from its business, nor divide, withdraw, or in 
any way pay to the stockholders, or any of them, any part of its capital stock, or reduce its capital stock, except according to this 
act, and in case of any violation of the provisions of this section, the directors under whose administration the same may happen 
shall be jointly and severally liable, at any time within six years after paying such dividend, to the corporation and to its creditors, 
in the event of its dissolution or insolvency, to the full amount of the dividend made or capital stock so divided, withdrawn, paid 
out or reduced, with interest on the same from the time such liability accrued; * * *.' "
71,15," .  As recited in the opinion of the District Court, Gottesman v. General Motors Corporation, 171 F.Supp. 661, 663 
(S.D.N.Y.1959). "
72,16," .  Judge Clark wrote the opinion in both cases with Judge Swan concurring in each.  Dissenting opinions were expressed by 
Judge Chase in Fanchon and Judge Moore in Gottesman."

74,18," .  See Escoett v. Aldecress Country Club, 16 N.J. 438, 446-447, 109 A.2d 277 (1954) and cases there cited. "
83,1," The trial court's memorandum provides in part as follows: ""III ""The first subject to which I address my attention is chosen for priority in order not because it has basic significance, although it 
has, but only because it can, I think, be disposed of most easily. ""I recognize the fiduciary relationship that exists between an employee and his employer.  No conversation between the parties, 
specifically dwelling upon the subject, was necessary to establish that relationship and the incident duties, they being created 
and defined by the law.  Section 2322 of our Civil Code, being part of an article on the 'authority of agents,' states that '[an] 
authority expressed in general terms, however broad, does not authorize an agent: . . . 3 To do any act which a trustee is 
forbidden to do by article two, chapter one, of the last title.' This provision directs us back to the cleanly cut statutory delineation 
of the 'Obligations of Trustees' found in sections 2228-2239 of the same code. ""These statutes are supplemented by the Labor Code, wherein, in section 2856, the Legislature has decreed as follows: HN1[
] ""' § 2856.  [Compliance with employer's directions.] An employee shall substantially comply with all the directions of his employer concerning the service on which he is engaged, except where such obedience is impossible or unlawful, or would 
impose new and unreasonable burdens upon the employee.' ""' § 2859.  [Use of skill possessed.] An employee is always bound to use such skill as he possesses, so far as the same is 
required, for the service specified.' ""' § 2860.  Ownership of things acquired by virtue of employment.  Everything which an employee acquires by virtue of his 
employment, except the compensation which is due to him from his employer, belongs to the employer, whether acquired 
lawfully or unlawfully, or during or after the expiration of the term of his employment.' "
84,," ""As pointed out in Burns v. Clark, 133 Cal. 634 [66 P. 12, 85 Am. St. Rep. 233], a key phrase in section 2860 is the phrase 'by 
virtue of his employment.' ""A statement of the law on this subject, law which is really quite elementary, appears in 2 California Jurisprudence 2d at pages 
769-774; and having satisfied myself of the fairness and reliability of the statement, I have no hesitancy in citing it as a short-cut 
to an abundance of precedent. ""In relation to all the foregoing, however, we must have in mind that the relationship and duties of an employee to his employer 
are one matter, and the duty, if any, of an ex-employee to an ex-employer is quite another. HN2[
] ""Whether any duty or interdiction, other than the general duties that rest upon us all, hangs over the ex-employee 
depends on the existence or nonexistence of either or both of two possibilities: (1) a contract yet in force in one or more 
respects, and to be performed, or a new contract, or (2) an item of private property, which may be a product of the mind, 
belonging to the ex-employer, in respect to which the ex-employee still carries a trust responsibility, or the ownership of which, 
as of any other private property, commands by law the respect of, and forbids the invasion, trespass or conversion by, others 
than the owner.  . . . ""IV "". . . I refer to the proposition [i.e., urged by plaintiff's counsel] that by virtue of section 1962, subdivision 2, of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, the defendant Koutnik is forever bound by recitals contained in the verification of the patent application, Plaintiff's 
Exhibit 35, and is now estopped to deny the originality, as of the date of that application, of the inventions and the claims in 
respect thereto stated in the application. ""The pertinent part of section 1962, Code of Civil Procedure, reads as follows: ""' § 1962.  [Presumptions; conclusive].  Specification of Conclusive Presumptions.  The following presumptions, and no others, 
are deemed conclusive: ""'. . . . HN3[
] ""'2. The truth of the facts recited, from the recital in a written instrument between the parties thereto, or their successors 
in interest by a subsequent title; but this rule does not apply to the recital of a consideration;' ""In the verification to the patent application, Koutnik and Piet made these statements among others not pertinent here: ""'. . . that we have read the foregoing specification and claims and we verily believe we are the original, first and joint inventors of 
the invention or discovery in High Pressure Valve Mechanism described and claimed therein; that we do not know and do not 
believe that this invention was ever known or used before our invention or discovery thereof, or patented or described in any 
printed publication in any country before our invention or discovery thereof, or more than one year prior to this application . . .' ""It seems clear to me that the intended effect of Code of Civil Procedure, section 1962, subdivision 2, is a limited effect, and that 
the presumption applies conclusively only when it is relevant to a controversy that questions 'the obligations or liabilities of the 
contracting parties' or 'their successors in interest' under the 'written instrument' in which the recitals appeared.  I say frankly that 
I know of no California case stating explicitly what I just have said, but a like view, I believe, is implied or insinuated in: "" Gas Appliance Sales Co., Inc. v. W. B. Bastian Manufacturing Co., 87 Cal.App. 301, 306 [262 P. 452]; "" Taylor v. Lundblade, 43 Cal.App.2d 638, 640 [111 P.2d 344]; "" Rhine v. Ellen, 36 Cal. 362. "
85,," ""The instant action involves no question concerning the liabilities or obligations of the parties under and/or by virtue of the patent 
application, Exhibit 35, the verification thereof or the assignment to Futurecraft Corporation, and this action is not in any of its 
causes founded on or claimed to derive from any of or all such instruments. "". . . . ""Exhibit 35 is, of course, in evidence, and I would say rather conspicuously so.  I do not deny or question its place in evidence for 
all pertinent and reasonable purposes and inferences, not all of which are favorable to plaintiff, but I do . . . refuse to set up a 
conclusive presumption or an estoppel against other relevant evidence, as requested and urged by the plaintiff.  [Emphasis 
shown.] ""V "". . . a theme that has been intoned by plaintiff throughout this litigation . . . [is] that the one all-important, basic and critical 
question in this case, and in any similar case, is whether or not the employee, while in the confidential relationship of servant to 
his master, received ideas or knowledge from his employer, or through his employment, which, since the end of the employment, 
he has used to his own advantage and/or to the injury of the former employer. ""This theory . . . has been encouraged by the much quoted detached words of Mr. Justice Holmes in E. I. Du Pont De Nemours 
Powder Co. v. Masland, 244 U.S. 100, 102 [37 S.Ct. 575, 61 L.Ed. 1016], quoted on page 16 of plaintiff's trial brief: ""'Whether the plaintiffs have any valuable secret or not, the defendant knows the facts, whatever they are, through a special 
confidence that he accepted.  The property may be denied, but the confidence cannot be.' ""We find a similarly isolated statement on page 4 of plaintiff's trial brief, taken from Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corp. v. Cox, 
50 N.Y.S.2d 643, 657 . . .: ""'Concededly, the field [of prior art] was not entirely virgin.  But the plaintiffs' expenditures [sic] of time and money brought results 
not reached by others.  Once we conclude that the work done under Cox's supervision was confidential, and that Cox threatens 
to breach the confidence, all else is of subordinate importance.' ""The most clarifying way to deal with this theory that confidence is paramount and all else is subordinate is, I believe, by reductio 
ad absurdum.  . . . "". . . . HN4[
] ""Manifestly and necessarily, when we confront the claimed existence of a trade secret, and a claim that it has been 
misappropriated, trespassed upon or wrongly converted, we are commanded to an injury that is just as vital as that which looks 
for a confidential relationship, namely, an inquiry into the existence or nonexistence of the element of private property. "". . . . ""California by numerous judicial decisions and by statute long has recognized private property in products of the mind.  
Examples of the recognition are the following: ""Civil Code, section 980, subdivision (b): ""'The inventor or proprietor of any invention or design, with or without delineation, or other graphical representation, has an 
exclusive ownership therein, and in the representation or expression thereof, which continues so long as the invention or design 
and the representations or expressions thereof made by him remain in his possession.' ""Civil Code, section 983, subdivision (b): ""'If the owner of any invention or design intentionally makes it public, a copy or reproduction may be made public by any person, 
without responsibility to the owner, so far as the law of this State is concerned.' ""Civil Code, section 984: ""'If the owner of an invention or design does not make it public, any other person subsequently and originally producing the 
same thing has the same right therein as the prior inventor, which is exclusive to the same extent against all persons except the 
prior inventor, or those claiming under him.' "
86,," ""Hence we are not engaged in mere psychic phenomena or pure speculation or the pursuit of mystery when we inquire whether 
Mr. Koutnik, when he left the employ of plaintiff, carried with him any knowledge or ideas which then were and still are the 
private property of the plaintiff. ""VI "". . . at least certain of the so-called trade secrets claimed by plaintiff are now, and long have been, in the public domain, or if in 
any instance, the private property of anyone, then the property of someone other than plaintiff. ""In its courageous effort to efface competition from the defendants by the theory of being exclusive owner of certain trade 
secrets, plaintiff has confronted three distinct and formidable factual barriers: (1) Its own sales of its valves in the market that 
exists for such products, and its sales and promotional efforts and methods, including public displays (meaning, in this case, of 
course, displays for that part of the public interested in such products).  [Emphasis added.] (2) The prior art, the previously 
known, published and utilized ideas, principles, devices and methods in valve manufacture. (3) The filing by plaintiff of an 
application for patent, Plaintiff's Exhibit 35, and the incidental necessary disclosure to the public of all those ideas and features 
claimed to be secret. ""Although our California statutes defining property rights in products of the mind (Civ. Code, §§ 980- 985) are not expressly 
related to the subject of trade secrets, they must be respected as expressions of California's legislative theory, policy and 
decision.  Civil Code, section 983, subdivision (b), not only specifically states a significant principle, but it is freighted with 
connotations not to be ignored.  It says: HN5[
] ""'If the owner of any invention or design intentionally makes it public, a copy or reproduction may be made public by any 
person, without responsibility to the owner, so far as the law of this State is concerned.' ""The fact that the structure or configuration of a valve is not obvious to external observation or examination is of no significance 
in a market such as we deal with here.  We cannot know the recipe for a jar of jam, either, just from looking at it.  As the 
evidence conclusively has proved, it is no 'trick,' but only a matter of some labor and time, for an engineer or a machinist to cut 
open a valve and see in bare display all the details of its configuration. Every time a valve was sold, all the 'secrets' in its design 
were transmitted to the purchaser, who then was empowered to transmit them to others as he wished or willed.  [Emphasis 
added.] ""Counsel for defendants have laid a good deal of stress upon the fact -- and it is a fact -- that plaintiff made numerous sales of its 
valves without imposing or attempting to impose any restriction upon the purchaser as to the use to which the valves might be 
put or the disposition the purchaser might make of them.  It is evident to me that I do not attach so much importance to so-called 
proprietary notices and notices of restrictive use as counsel for defendants possibly do, and as counsel for plaintiff certainly do. ""I recognize, of course, that as between A, a manufacturer and prospective seller, and B, a prospective or actual buyer, any kind 
of a lawful agreement they wish to, and do, make will be binding upon them . . . But the effect of this private agreement upon 
others not privy to it, upon the public, and upon a secret or so-called secret, is quite a different matter . . . And I am not 
convinced that in the commercial world one can preserve a trade secret by the simple device of telling all to whom he reveals it 
that he claims it to be a secret and his private property. ""I agree with Mr. Lyon that HN6[
] the patent laws of the United States delimit the only legitimate way by which one can 
establish a monopoly in the commercial utilization of an original mechanical idea.  Were we judicially to authorize the creation of 
a monopoly by the simple and easy method of attaching 'proprietary' and restrictive notices to products and to the drawings, 
sales literature, invoices, bills of sale and other papers used in selling and trying to sell them, we would circumvent the patent 
law and negate the antitrust laws, two chapters of jurisprudence firmly embedded in the public policy of our commonwealth. ""VII ""Facing the prior art in the field of valve manufacture, plaintiff is in the unenviable position of being required to depose or 
disparage, if he is to surmount the revelation of the evidence, the very doctrine that he must mightily uphold to obtain the relief 
he seeks or any valuable relief.  I refer to the doctrine of equivalence. Plaintiff's own expert witness, Mr. Gregg, utilized and 
expounded the doctrine.  And defendants' expert witness, Mr. Doble, made equally sincere and effective use of the doctrine in 
displaying the prior art. "
87,," ""I do not mean to imply that the doctrine of equivalence is needed to give relevant meaning to every fact and record produced at 
the trial from the storehouse of knowledge relative to valve manufacture. Indeed, in many details no translation or interpretation 
through functional analogy is required. ""But the doctrine of equivalence is vital to plaintiff's case.  It might be called the heart of plaintiff's cause of action, if plaintiff has 
any cause of action. ""The pleadings and statements of counsel and certain of the evidence have made clear to the court that plaintiff does not 
contend that either defendant has produced, or threatens to produce, a valve having the exact configuration of any of plaintiff's 
valves. It is equally clear that plaintiff does not seek injunctive relief which merely would restrain defendants from producing a 
valve exactly like any of plaintiff's valves. Not only does plaintiff pray for an injunction that would make full play of the doctrine of 
equivalence, but anything less would be of no value to it.  [Emphasis added.] ""If we were to ask a dozen learned and skillful valve engineers each to work independently of the other, each to avail himself of 
all accumulated and recorded knowledge of the valve art, and each to design a valve to accomplish a specific function, the 
probability is that no two of them would produce precisely the same configuration. The point is, as plaintiff well knows and as its 
pleadings, prayer, evidence and argument all indicate, a valve manufacturer has no advantage over his competitor simply in 
having a unique configuration, a unique way in which he arranges and uses the commonly held or available knowledge, ideas 
and mechanical principles relating to the art. ""The court has no choice but to recognize and respect the full significance of the doctrine of equivalence, and doing so, it finds in 
the prior art, not necessarily alone, but certainly in conjunction with other relevant factors, formidable opposition to plaintiff's 
claim of private property in the ideas which it seeks to have defendants enjoined from using. ""VIII HN7[
] ""After a person has applied for a patent from the United States Government and has complied with the law pertaining to 
the public disclosure of his ideas, he is hardly in a position thereafter to claim that any of the ideas so disclosed is a trade secret. 
If he establishes a claim of invention, he, of course, will have a right of private property as evidenced by, and to the extent 
granted in, the patent. Thereupon his rights of monopoly will be controlled by the patent laws, not by any equitable or legal 
principles applicable to the misuse of trade secrets. ""As stated in Speaker v. Shaler Co., 87 F.2d 985, (Circuit Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit; certiorari denied, 301 U.S. 695 [57 
S.Ct. 923, 81 L.Ed. 1350]) concerning the filing of an application for patent: ""'The contents thereof were disclosed to the world by filing it [the application] in the patent office.  Nothing therein could have 
remained confidential or secret.' "". . . . ""IX ""Uncontradicted evidence establishes the fact that when Rodrick [sic] Koutnik entered the employ of plaintiff, he carried with him 
a good deal of knowledge concerning the art, science and mechanics of valve design and manufacture, and a good deal of skill 
in the application of that knowledge.  We, of course, cannot know precisely what ideas, theories and facts then were lodged in 
his own brain. ""Much, probably most, of that knowledge had been acquired at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of 
Technology, where many young engineers have received not only a theoretical, but an extraordinarily practical, 'post-graduate 
course.' It is reasonable to conclude that the learning there imbibed by Koutnik was supplemented by his own independent 
studies and thinking and possibly by contacts and association with engineers from other institutions. ""It would be impossible for me, as I am sure it would for any counsel in the case, to draw a boundary line between the 
knowledge carried by Koutnik into his employment by plaintiff and any additional knowledge or ideas he may have acquired by 
virtue of that employment.  Indeed, no such boundary line exists, for as new knowledge is acquired it integrates itself with the 
old.  We deal here with a sum total of ideas, theories, facts, principles and skills that we know not how to divide, assuming that a 
part is attributable to Koutnik's employment by plaintiff. ""To grant plaintiff the relief requested, or any remedy that would be of value to it, would necessitate enjoining Koutnik from the 
use of knowledge, a good deal of which certainly is his own or belongs to the public domain, gained by him through his own "
88,," industry and intellectual faculties, independently of any association with plaintiff, and inextricably interlaced with any knowledge 
he may have acquired through his employment by plaintiff.  [Emphasis added.] HN8[
] ""To prevent or to attempt to prevent a person from using his own learning and skill, in respect to which he is under no 
duty of restraint by virtue of a trust or confidence, would be so plainly an injustice and a social and economic folly, that when we 
have an actual or possible integration of such knowledge with knowledge or ideas encumbered by a prohibition because of their 
genesis in confidence, the plaintiff seeking prohibitory judgment must carry the burden of identifying and isolating the particular 
products of the mind in which he claims to have a right of private property. ""X ""For reasons indicated, I conclude that plaintiff is not entitled to take anything by this action. "". . . ."""
88,2," The findings of fact and conclusions of law are in pertinent part as follows: ""Findings of Fact ""1. At no time during the course of his employment by Futurecraft did Koutnik in any way violate the fiduciary relationship which 
existed between him and Futurecraft because of such employment nor did he do any act which a trustee is forbidden to do under 
the laws of this state. ""2. When Koutnik reentered the employ of Futurecraft on or about January 31, 1953, said date being not less than five months 
prior to the development or designing, or the alleged conception or invention, by Futurecraft of any of the valves or valve 
components referred to in Paragraphs V, VI, VII and IX of the first cause of action of the complaint, Koutnik brought with him 
much, if not most, of the knowledge and skill concerning the art, science and mechanics of valve design and manufacture which 
he utilized in designing and developing, or participating in the design or development of, the valves or valve components referred 
to in Paragraphs V, VI and VII of the first cause of action of the complaint, or which he utilized in designing or developing, or 
participating in the design or development of, certain progenitors of the valve referred to in Paragraph IX of said cause of action. 
If Koutnik acquired any part of said knowledge or skill by virtue of his employment by Futurecraft, then plaintiff has not sustained 
the burden of identifying or isolating that part of said knowledge or skill so acquired.  In this connection, during the course of his 
employment by Futurecraft Koutnik had no knowledge of the design or internal arrangement of the parts of, or the materials used 
in, the valve referred to in Paragraph IX of the first cause of action of the complaint, and all of the allegations contained in the 
third sentence of Paragraph IX of said cause of action are untrue. ""3. None of the matters or things allegedly confidential to Futurecraft, as set forth in Paragraphs V, VI, VII and IX of the first 
cause of action of the complaint and in Answers 4, 8, 34, 57, 104 and 108 of Futurecraft's answers to Clary's interrogatories, is 
or ever was owned by, or confidential to, or the private property or a trade secret of, Futurecraft.  In this connection all of the 
allegations contained in the third sentence of Paragraph V and in the fourth sentence of Paragraph VI, of Paragraph VII, and of 
Paragraph IX of the first cause of action of the complaint are untrue. ""4. Each and all of the matters and things hereinabove referred to in Paragraph 3 was in the public domain or a matter of public 
knowledge or of general knowledge in the trade or industry concerned with the design or manufacture of valves or valve 
components before any of said matters or things was assertedly conceived, invented, designed or developed by Futurecraft, or 
in any event before Koutnik terminated his employment at Futurecraft on or about March 17, 1956. ""5. Each and all of the matters and things hereinabove referred to in Paragraph 3 was known in the art relating to the design or 
manufacture of valves or valve components, that is to say, was known through patents or applications therefor or through 
published or utilized materials, ideas, principles, devices or methods relating to such art, before any of said matters or things 
was assertedly conceived, invented, designed or developed by Futurecraft.  In this connection all of the allegations contained in 
the fourth affirmative defense appearing in the respective answers of Koutnik and Clary are true. ""6. If any matter or thing hereinabove referred to in Paragraph 3 was ever confidential to, or a trade secret of, Futurecraft, every 
element of confidence or secrecy with respect thereto was made public knowledge, or in any event was lost to Futurecraft, either 
through deliveries or sales by Futurecraft to its customers or prospective customers of the valves and valve components referred 
to in Paragraphs V, VI, VII and IX of the first cause of action of the complaint, or through some action taken by the customer or 
prospective customer subsequent to such sale or delivery, or through drawings showing the internal arrangement of the parts 
and the design of such valves and valve components delivered by Futurecraft to said customers or prospective customers. Said 
sales or deliveries commenced in or about September 1953 and have continued to a date not earlier than June 1958.  Many of 
the sales and deliveries of each type of valve and valve component mentioned in said Paragraphs V, VI, VII and IX were made "
89,," by Futurecraft without imposing, or seeking to impose, any restriction or limitation upon the purchaser or recipient thereof with 
reference to the use to which such valve or valve component could be put or the disposition which the purchaser or recipient 
could make of the same.  In this connection, with certain exceptions the purchasers and/or recipients of said valves, valve 
components and/or drawings do not stand in any confidential or fiduciary relation toward Futurecraft with reference to any matter 
or thing disclosed by said valves, valve components or drawings. ""7. Each and all of the matters and things alleged to be confidential to Futurecraft with regard to each of the valves and valve 
components referred to in Paragraphs V, VI, VII and IX of the first cause of action of the complaint were contained in, and were 
easily ascertainable from, the valves and valve components so sold and/or delivered as hereinabove mentioned in Paragraph 6. ""8. Each and all of the valves and valve components which were sold by Futurecraft, as hereinabove referred to in Paragraph 6, 
were sold with Futurecraft's knowledge that the same were purchased by the customer for resale by said customer. ""9. The form of proprietary notice placed by Futurecraft upon certain of its drawings of the valves and valve components referred 
to in Paragraphs V, VI, VII and IX of the first cause of action of the complaint was not intended by Futurecraft to impose, nor did 
it impose, any restriction or limitation upon any customer or prospective customer of Futurecraft, or any ultimate customer or 
prospective customer of any such valve or valve component, with regard to the use to which such valve or valve component 
could be put or the disposition which the customer or prospective customer could make of the same. ""10. As early as September 1953, Futurecraft publicly sold, without any restriction whatsoever, valves of the type referred to in 
Paragraph V of the first cause of action of the complaint. ""11. As early as April 1954, Futurecraft publicly sold, without any restriction whatsoever, valve components of the type referred 
to in Paragraph VI of the first cause of action of the complaint. ""12. As early as December 1957, and thereafter Futurecraft publicly sold, without any restrictions whatsoever, valve components 
of the type referred to in Paragraph VII of the first cause of action of the complaint. ""13. As early as August 1956, Futurecraft publicly sold, without any restriction whatsoever, valves of the type referred to in 
Paragraph IX of the first cause of action of the complaint. ""14. After terminating his employment with Futurecraft on or about March 17, 1956, Koutnik neither carried any trust 
responsibility nor owed any obligation to Futurecraft with reference to any of the valves or valve components mentioned in 
Paragraphs V, VI, VII and IX of the first cause of action of the complaint or any of the matters or things allegedly confidential to 
Futurecraft with respect to said valves or valve components, nor did any contractual relation exist between Koutnik and 
Futurecraft at any time after such termination of employment. ""15. No controversy now exists or ever did exist, between Futurecraft, on the one hand, and Koutnik or Clary, or either of them, 
on the other, concerning the rights, obligations or liabilities of any party to this action under or by virtue of any portion or claim of, 
or any amendment to, the application for United States Letters Patent, No. 508,444, or the assignment to Futurecraft of the 
invention described in said application, which said application and assignment are referred to in Paragraph V of the first cause of 
action of the complaint; and nothing in said application or assignment prevents Koutnik or Clary from establishing the source of 
the disclosure in said patent application or the lack of secrecy with respect to said disclosure. ""16. If any matter or thing contained in the application for United States Letters Patent, No. 508,444, mentioned in Paragraph V 
of the first cause of action of the complaint, or in the application for United States Letters Patent, No. 632,828, mentioned in 
Paragraph IX of said cause of action, or any amendment to either of said applications, was ever confidential to, or a trade secret 
of, Futurecraft, Futurecraft elected by sale of valves embodying the disclosure of said applications and the filing of said 
applications and by taking advantage of the provisions of 35 U.S.C. § 102, to rely upon the patent laws of the United States and 
is precluded from asserting that the subject matter of said applications, or either of them, constitute a trade secret. ""From the foregoing findings of fact the court draws the following: ""Conclusions of Law ""The court concludes: ""1. In all respects as set forth in the foregoing findings of fact. ""2. Said findings having been made upon issues which are determinative of the cause, any further finding or findings upon 
issues other than those embraced in the foregoing findings would be immaterial and are not made for that reason. "

amended, be dismissed, and that defendants recover their costs herein incurred."""

Eastern District of Pennsylvania against the defendants and the coconspirators named in this Count.  The indictment therein 
charged that during a period beginning at least as early as 1956 and continuing until sometime in 1960, the defendants and 
coconspirators named in this Count engaged in a combination and conspiracy in unreasonable restraint of interstate trade and 
commerce in distribution transformers in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.  The indictment further charged that such 
combination and conspiracy consisted of a continuing agreement, understanding and concert of action, the substantial terms of 
which were to fix and maintain prices, terms and conditions of sale of distribution transformers and to quote to customers only 
prices for distribution transformers as agreed upon and fixed.  The United States further charged that the defendants and 
coconspirators named in this Count, for the purpose of forming and effectuating the combination and conspiracy charged, did, 
among other things, the acts alleged in paragraph 14.  On December 8, 1960, said defendants and coconspirators pleaded nolo 
contendere, and on February 7, 1961, judgment of guilty on those pleas was entered, and sentences were imposed by the 
Court.'"
139,22," .  Paragraph 15 of the complaint in 61 C 1285 was substantially similar to the above, charging additionally that the conspiracy 
was 'to fix and maintain prices for the sale of power switching equipment, to allocate sales of power switching equipment and to 
submit noncompetitive, collusive and rigged bids and price quotations in connection with the sale of power switching equipment, 
to electric utility companies and other purchasers * * *.  On December 8, 1960, all of the defendants and coconspirators named 
in this Complaint pleaded guilty to the indictment, except Joslyn, which pleaded nolo contendere on that date, and Schwager-
Wood, which pleaded nolo contendere on February 6, 1961.  Judgment of guilty was entered on all of those pleas and 
sentences were imposed by the Court on February 6, 1961.' "
141,23," .  Justice Ulysses S. Schwartz stated the difference between dictum and obiter dictum in Larson v. Johnson, 1 Ill.App.2d 36, at 
40-41, 116 N.E.2d 187, at 189: 'Whether a legal proposition stated in an opinion is obiter dictum is to be determined from a 
reading of the entire opinion.  If the opinion expressed on a legal question is one casually reached by the court on an issue 
unrelated to the essence of the controversy or based on hypothetical facts, then it is obiter dictum.  If, however, the question 
involved is one of a number of legal issues presented by the facts of that particular case, the court's decision on that question is 
not dictum even though it be the last ground of many decided by the court, all in support of its final conclusion.' "
142,24, .  Not a treble damage suit. 
143,25," .  The condition was: 'The corporate defendants be enjoined from defending --  on the grounds that they have not violated the 
Sherman Act as charged in the government complaint --  any damage proceeding initiated by any state or political subdivision 
thereof, if such suit were instituted prior to the date of entry of this final judgment.'"
143,26," .  The colloquy runs (51 Cong.Rec. Part 16, p. 15823): "
144,," 'Mr. Reed: * * * 36 defendants entered pleas of nolo contendere. * * * Now, a citizen wronged by this combination, robbed by 
these criminals, can not under this report of the conferees, if it becomes a law, introduce in evidence the record showing their 
plea of guilty * * *. 'Mr. Walsh: Let me inquire of the Senator if he understands the purport of the bill as it is recommended by the conference 
committee to reach the case of a judgment entered on a plea of guilty. 'Mr. Reed: I do; a judgment by consent, in my opinion, covers a judgment entered upon a plea of nolo contendere * * *. 'Mr. Walsh: That is what I wanted to inquire of the Senator.  He thinks that the term 'consent judgment' would reach to a 
judgment entered on a plea of guilty? 'Mr. Reed: I think it would.  It is a judgment nolo contendere. It is really a judgment by consent * * *.  It is my opinion, from that 
language, that the deduction must be drawn that the exception applies to criminal as well as civil consents.  The only way you 
can consent in a criminal case is by an absolute plea of guilty or the plea of nolo contendere. * * * (P. 15824) 'Mr. Walsh: I scarcely think the Senator will care to say that judgments hereafter entered upon a plea of guilty would 
fall under the discrimination of consent judgments or decrees, because I take it that no criminal would ever consent that a 
judgment be entered against him when he pleads guilty. The judgment goes as a matter of course against him. * * *' (P. 15824) 'Mr. Walsh: * * * I am not able to agree with the Senator that in the future the judgment entered upon a plea of guilty 
in a criminal action would not be available under the proposed statute.' (P. 15825) 'Mr. Overman: * * * We have not deprived a citizen of a solitary shade or shadow of a single right he has now in the 
courts.' (P. 15825) 'Mr. Reed: * * * When a criminal stands in a court of justice and pleads guilty, that plea of guilty can be introduced in 
evidence against him in any case where his guilt is in question --  not the judgment, perhaps, but the fact that he pleaded guilty 
can be shown.  Let me illustrate: * * * A man defrauds another of $ 10,000; he is indicted for it; he pleads guilty in court * * *.  The 
injured party thereupon sues him to recover a civil judgment for $ 10,000. Under the law now he can introduce the indictment 
and the fact that the man stood in court and pleaded guilty to the indictment. 'Mr. Overman: Does the Senator from Missouri contend that there is anything in this bill which applies to suits between 
individuals of the kind of which he is speaking? 'Mr. Reed: Why certainly.  This applies to that class of evidence, of course; it is limited to trust cases; there can not be any doubt 
about that; and you have tried to cut out the pleas of guilty in trust cases.  You have got no more right to destroy the evidentiary 
value of a plea of guilty in a trust case than in the case of an embezzler or a murderer.  The evidence in either case can be used 
without any statute * * *.  There is a reason why a consent judgment or plea of guilty should be received that does not apply to 
an ordinary judgment. * * * When a man goes into court and consents to a decree, it is his solemn admission of record, it imports 
verity; there can be no mistake. * * * By this bill the conferees say that plea should not be introduced in evidence against him.  
Absurdity could go * * * to no further extreme * * *.  Even when the parties have said, 'Here we are; we are guilty; we admit it; * * 
*' We by this bill propose to say to the injured and innocent party who has a suit against the culprit, 'You can not prove that fact 
in your suit where you are seeking to get back the money of which you were robbed by the scoundrel who has just admitted his 
guilt."" (P. 15827) 'Mr. Reed: * * * What injury or wrong is done by using in future litigation the confession of guilt that a guilty man has 
made?' (Italics supplied.)"
144,27," .  (P. 15938) 'Mr. Nelson: * * * These provisions deal tenderly with the great trusts and monopolies, who, knowing that they are 
guilty, can come into court, plead guilty, and say 'We have violated the law; we admit our guilt; we will agree to a consent 
decree; but these decrees must not be used in other suits against us where a private individual has been injured by the trust.' * * 
* See what a great hardship that involves? It is always difficult in the prosecution of cases against such trusts * * * to get the 
necessary and proper evidence * * *.  When the poor litigant goes into court under section 7 of the antitrust law to seek his 
remedy for triple damages, why should he be compelled to scour the country to get that evidence? * * * If the defendant has 
plead guilty in a suit brought by the Government of the United States and has admitted that it has violated the law, why, in 
Heaven's name, should not that poor individual litigant get the benefit of that admission? Why should he be put to the great 
expense and trouble of hunting up evidence to prove that the trust has violated the antitrust law when the trust has plead "
145,," guilty? * * * I am quoting from section 5 * * *.  (P. 15939) This, of course, it is argued will be an inducement for them to come into 
court and plead guilty * * *. 'Mr. Norris: Does it mean that in the cases that are now pending the trusts may come in and plead guilty before they take all their 
testimony * * *. 'Mr. Nelson: Yes, certainly; and that you can not use the judgment itself in a suit brought by anyone else. 'Mr. Norris: Exactly; but after the passage of this bill * * * if some additional evidence is taken this exemption would not apply. * * 
* 'Mr. Nelson: If they do not plead guilty without taking further evidence, they do not get the benefit * * *.  The argument in favor of 
those provisions is that it will induce the parties to come in and plead guilty; and, as was well said by the Senator from Missouri 
(Mr. Reed) in his magnificent argument, why should not the private litigant have the benefit of this plea of guilty? A consent 
decree is nothing more nor less than an admission of guilt. And why should not the poor private litigant, who comes in under 
section 7 and seeks to recover damages for the special injury that has been done to him, have the benefit of this admission? 'Mr. Norris: * * * Does not the Senator think, notwithstanding the proviso to which he has referred, if this bill shall pass that the 
judgment in a suit hereafter commenced could be offered and would be proper evidence, although it might not establish a prima 
facie case? 'Mr. Nelson: I do not think so, unless the parties should be the same. 'Mr. Norris: That might be true; but what I mean is this: While I agree with the Senator that the proviso ought not to be in the bill 
at all, still, the proviso being in, it would not necessarily follow that on account of the proviso a judgment could not be offered as 
evidence if it were otherwise admissible. 'Mr. Nelson: The effect of a judgment would not be restricted under the general law; but the Senator * * * who himself has been a 
judge, knows very well that where there is not an identity of parties the judgment could not be used. 'Mr. Norris: I understand that: but I do not think the Senator gets my idea * * *.  Notwithstanding the proviso, * * * suppose that in 
all other respects it was proper to offer a judgment in evidence and there was no reason why it should not be admitted, 
assuming that in other respects the judgment is proper evidence, then this proviso would not exclude it, as I understand. 'Mr. Nelson: No. 'Mr. Overman: It does not interfere with any right he has at present. 'Mr. Nelson: It does not interfere with any right, but we were supposed to be giving the poor fellow some value received by this 
law.  We proposed to give him a remedy by this section.'"
145,51," Congressional Record (p. 16276). 'Mr. Bathrick: That means, in one analysis at least, that if a trust, having pursued unfair methods of competition, having crushed 
out its small competitors, and at last having gotten into the meshes of the law, desires to walk up, with the loot in its pockets, and 
say it pleads guilty, it avoids all use of the testimony taken in the Government action against it on the part of a private plaintiff 
who desires to recover damages. 'Mr. Webb: No, a consent judgment has the same effect that it would have had if the trust had fought out the case, but such 
judgment does not have a 'prima facie' effect when used in evidence.' "
146,28," .  In many instances ambiguous phrases are used, such as the word 'surrender,' which defendants imply means a guilty plea, 
but to which a connotation restricted to nolo pleas might also be given."
146,29," .  That construction --  by dictum --  was placed on the statute as long ago as 1939, in the Twin Ports Oil Company case, supra, 
yet no amendatory legislation has occurred directed to disabuse the public of that interpretation. "
147,*," Together with No. 43, Loew's Incorporated et al. v. United States, and No. 44, C & C Super Corp. v. United States, also on 
appeals from the same Court. "
155,1," ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal . . . ."" 26 Stat. 209 (1890), as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 1. "
157,2," National Telefilm has, however, filed a brief in opposition to the Government's requests for modifications in the decree, 
discussed below. "
158,3," See International Salt Co. v.  United States, 332 U.S. 392;  United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 U.S. 131; Times-
Picayune Pub. Co. v.  United States, 345 U.S. 594; Northern Pacific R. Co. v.  United States, 356 U.S. 1."
158,4," Since the requisite economic power may be found on the basis of either uniqueness or consumer appeal, and since market 
dominance in the present context does not necessitate a demonstration of market power in the sense of § 2 of the Sherman Act, 
it should seldom be necessary in a tie-in sale case to embark upon a full-scale factual inquiry into the scope of the relevant 
market for the tying product and into the corollary problem of the seller's percentage share in that market.  This is even more 
obviously true when the tying product is patented or copyrighted, in which case, as appears in greater detail below, sufficiency of 
economic power is presumed.  Appellants' reliance on  United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, is 
therefore misplaced. "
159,5," Appellants' framing of their argument in terms of each of them not having dominance in the market for television exhibition of 
feature films misconceives the applicable legal standard.  As noted, supra, p. 45, ""sufficient economic power"" as contemplated 
by the Northern Pacific case is a term more inclusive in scope than ""market dominance."" "
160,6," To use the trial court's apt example, forcing a television station which wants ""Gone With The Wind"" to take ""Getting Gertie's 
Garter"" as well is taking undue advantage of the fact that to television as well as motion picture viewers there is but one ""Gone 
With The Wind."" "
161,7," The operative portion of the injunctions appears at p. 43, supra. "
166,1," .  The answers of Schwager-Wood Corporation to the interrogatories propounded to it contain the sworn statement of A. C. 
Schwager that Schwager-Wood Corporation was dissolved under Oregon Law on November 6, 1959, following and incident to a 
change in ownership of the Schwager-Wood business.  Schwager-Wood Corporation contends that any transactions subsequent 
to the dissolution are not properly ascribable to it.  By reason of the conclusions expressed in this decision, this contention need 
not be and is not ruled upon by the Court. "
171,1," .  'The Alabama corporation, which has an office in North Carolina, is the instrumentality employed to market Cudahy products 
within the state; but it does not do so as defendant's agent.  It buys from the defendant and sells to dealers. In fulfillment of such 
contracts to sell, goods packed by the defendant in Iowa are shipped direct to dealers, and from them the Alabama corporation 
collects the purchase price.  Through ownership of the entire capital stock and otherwise, the defendant dominates the Alabama 
corporation, immediately and completely, and exerts its control both commercially and financially in substantially the same way, 
and mainly through the same individuals, as it does over those selling branches or departments of its business not separately 
incorporated which are established to market the Cudahy products in other states.  The existence of the Alabama company as a 
distinct corporate entity is, however, in all respects observed.  Its books are kept separate.  All transactions between the two 
corporations are represented by appropriate entries in their respective books in the same way as if the two were wholly 
independent corporations. * * *'"
171,2," .  'Thus, by substituting practical, business conceptions for the previous hair-splitting legal technicalities encrusted upon the 
'found'-'present'-' carrying-on-business' sequence, the Court yielded to and made effective Congress' remedial purpose.  
Thereby it relieved persons injured through corporate violations of the antitrust laws from the 'often insuperable obstacle' of 
resorting to distant forums for redress of wrongs done in the places of their business or residence.  A foreign corporation no 
longer could come to a district, perpetrate there the injuries outlawed, and then by retreating or even without retreating to its 
headquarters defeat or delay the retribution due.' "
172,3," .  While expressions in Bankers Life & Casualty Co. v. Holland, supra, may be in a sense dicta, both the majority and the 
dissenting justices seem agreed that the Giusti theory is wrong."
172,4," .  HN3[
] Section 12 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C.  § 22) provides: 'Any suit, action, or proceeding under the antitrust laws against a corporation may be brought not only in the judicial district whereof it is an inhabitant, but also in any district wherein it 
may be found or transacts business; and all process in such cases may be served in the district of which it is an inhabitant, or 
wherever it may be found.' "
173,5," .  It is shown by Mr. Thornbrough's affidavit that there is physically located in Toronto, Canada, an organizational unit 
denominated for convenience 'North American Operations'.  The function and purpose of this organizational unit is to coordinate 
the activities of Massey-Ferguson Inc. in the United States and of that part of Massey-Ferguson Limited which carries on similar 
business activities in Canada.  The President of Massey-Ferguson Inc., acts as general manager over the coordinating 
organization called 'North American Operations'.  According to Mr. Thornbrough, although the manufacturing and sales activities 
in Canada and in the United States are coordinated through the general manager of North American Operations, his authority so 
far as Massey-Ferguson Inc. is concerned stems entirely from his position as President of Massey-Ferguson Inc. Massey-
Ferguson Inc. reimbursed Limited in full for the amounts paid by Limited for services extended to Massey-Ferguson Inc.  
Employees who reside in Canada and who perform services partly for Massey-Ferguson Inc. and partly for that division of 
Massey-Ferguson Limited (which is claimed to be the Canadian counterpart of Inc.) are paid in Canadian funds by checks 
issued by Massey-Ferguson Limited.  Thereafter Massey-Ferguson Inc. reimbursed Limited for that part of the amount paid 
which is properly allocable to services rendered on behalf of Massey-Ferguson Inc.  Mr. Thornbrough alleges that prior to 
November 1959 the present autonomy of the North American Operations (including Massey-Ferguson Inc.) from the direction 
and authority of the corporate or staff authority of Massey-Ferguson Limited was not so clearly or definitely defined as at 
present.  Prior to November 1959 some of the corporate or staff officers of Massey-Ferguson Limited participated to some extent 
in some of the decisions, policies and activities pertaining to North American Operations (including Massey-Ferguson Inc.).  As 
of November 1959, however, Mr. Thornbrough states that a policy was instituted to re-align corporate management or staff 
officers and to disengage these officers from all direct operational authority over North American Operations, including Massey-
Ferguson Inc.  Since the date mentioned, this has been the fixed policy and practice of the company, from which to the personal 
knowledge of the affiant there had been no deviation."
173,6," .  (Cross examination of the witness Thornbrough on deposition) 'Q. I am frankly confused at this time.  Does it follow from that that North American Operations in no way at all involve the 
Canadian Company? 'A. It does not involve the top management in Massey-Ferguson Limited. 'Q. Does it involve any kind of management whether it is top or otherwise? 'A. It involves what it says, North American Operations. 'Q. Since it involves what it says, namely North American Operations and since the company, Limited, that is Massey-Ferguson 
Limited, operates in North America, am I justified in concluding from that that Massey-Ferguson Limited performs activities which 
come under the general heading of North American Oprations? 'A. No.  You are not justified in making that comment. 'Q. Would you be good enough to clear that up for me? "
174,," 'A. Massey-Ferguson Limited in its parent company activities operates only in Canada.  So far as the United States is concerned 
all operations are carried out by Massey-Ferguson, Incorporated. 'Q. Insofar as Massey-Ferguson Limited operates in Canada, nowhere else, but in Canada, does it come within the scope of 
what has been called the division or branch quote North American Operations end quote? 'A. That portion of a Massey-Ferguson Limited activities which are encompassed in the North American Operations would be 
performed in Canada. 'Q. They would be performed in part by Mr. Staiger? 'A. As general manager of the North American Operation, yes. 'Q. Now would they not also be performed in part by Mr. Pomeroy as a sales manager? 'A. As director of marketing for both the Canadian and North American activities. 'Q. Is it clear that Mr. Pomeroy and Mr. Staiger performed services that benefited both companies, that is, Limited and Inc., isn't 
that so? 'A. They carried responsibilities for Massey-Ferguson, Inc., and they also carried responsibilities for the operations in Canada as 
a part of the corporate entity of Massey-Ferguson Limited.'"
174,7," .  The following colloquy occurred during oral argument: 'THE COURT: Now, North American Operations isn't a separate corporation? 'MR. McCARTHY: It is not.  It's just an organizational unit, consisting of * * * two things.  It consists of Massey-Ferguson Inc., 
and it consists of the comparable activities which are carried on by 'Limited' solely in Canada; namely, marketing and 
manufacturing, chiefly.  They in effect think of it as three --  that they in effect have three corporations, although in fact there isn't 
the division in 'Limited' that there is as far as 'Inc.' is concerned. 'THE COURT: Well, Mr. Alioto thinks they in fact think they have one * * * 'MR. McCARTHY: In their thinking, they have three.  The three consist of, first, the holding company, Massey-Ferguson, Ltd., 
consisting of the corporate and staff officers, as they are referred to, which on a coordinating and consultative and advice basis, 
in effect supervised the worldwide affairs of Massey Ferguson, Ltd. But these same corporate or staff officers do not exercise 
any direct operational control or direction over the activities of North American Operations.  North American Operations is run 
separate and apart from the corporate or staff officers of 'Limited,' and it is, as I say, it's in a different location, and it consists of a 
segment.  In fact, a segment which in effect has been carved off of 'Limited,' a segment comparable in some respects to the 
activities of 'Inc.' 'THE COURT: Now, did this staff set up, promulgate, plaintiffs' Exhibit 2? (Retail Store Operations Manual) 'MR. McCARTHY: No.  That's the Operations Manual. That's promulgated by North American Operations. 'THE COURT: Well, that's the staff? 'MR. McCARTHY: No.  That's distinguished from what I referred to as the corporate or staff officers of 'Limited.' "
175,," 'THE COURT: Well, it's an amalgamation of the two -- 'MR. McCARTHY: As I said, they think of it as three entities.  One is the corporate or staff officers, which is in a higher echelon of 
advice and so on, as to the worldwide operations.  The operational group is North American Operations, which consists of 'Inc.,' 
consists of the top officers of Massey Ferguson, Inc., and comparable officers of 'Limited' * * * 'THE COURT: All right.  But that combination * * * 'MR. McCARTHY: That is correct. 'THE COURT: Both 'Limited' and 'Inc.'? 'MR. McCARTHY: That is, it controls the operations of 'Inc.' -- 'THE COURT: In its sphere? 'MR. McCARTHY: In its sphere, and it controls the operations of that portion of 'Limited' which does comparable business in 
Canada * * * 'THE COURT: Are each of the officers who take part in this North American * * * Operations --  common officers of 'Inc.' and 
'Limited'? 'MR. McCARTHY: They are officers of both, but not always in the same capacity.  Mr. Staiger, for example, is president of 
Massey-Ferguson, Inc., and there is also a director of North American marketing activities, who is a vice president of Massey-
Ferguson, Inc. -- 'THE COURT: So when they approve this manual as it might affect the United States company, they are acting in their United 
States capacity -- 'MR. McCARTHY: That is correct, your Honor. 'THE COURT: --  And have that hat on.  anD then when they approve it in its other aspect, they are acting -- 'MR. McCARTHY: --  with that hat on.  They are in effect coordinating the marketing and manufacturing activities for both 
Canada and for the United States, and they function in a capacity as an officer of 'Inc.' when it pertains to the United States, and 
they function in the capacity as an officer of 'Limited' in a limited sphere when they are approving it for Canadian activities.'"
175,8," .  Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2, 'Retail Store Operations Manual-Massey-Ferguson' is issued by North American Procedures and Systems.  
The forward to the Manual states: 'The Retail Store Operations Manual is the collection of authorized communications relating to 
the control, administration and coordination of Retail Store Operations within the North American Operations Unit * * * Each 
supervisor who receives this Manual is responsible for understanding and adhering to the practices and procedures contained 
herein and for taking the necessary steps to insure that personnel under his jurisdiction are informed of the policies and 
procedures governing their day-to-day activities within the company.' The manual among other things provides that salaries in 
excess of $ 10,000 for store operations are to be 'authorized by the vice president North American Operations * * *.' Copies of 
personnel attendance records are to be forwarded to the 'Personnel and Industrial Relations Department, North American 
Operations'.  The form for 'Status and Salary Change' has a space for the approval of 'Operations Unit Department Head', and 
the 'North American office Services Manager' is responsible for providing record retention schedules as they develop. "
178,1, Specially designated to sit in the District Court. 
182,1," It found: 'Mackie-Duluk was a substantial and enlightened step, filling a long-felt want, in a field in which defendants have 
produced, with one exception (i.e. a patent to one Ackermans discussed at length and distinguished) only paper patents, the 
most emphasized being foreign, which did not even purport to do what Mackie-Duluk accomplished.' "

185,7," In further support of the view that the attention of the members of the Court was concentrated on the situation with respect to 
licensed General Motors cars, we note that apart from Mr. Justice Brennan's express reference to a distinction between Ford 
and General Motors top replacements there are indications in the opinion of the Court that the licensed-unlicensed distinction 
was recognized and only the licensed situation considered.  Among these 'clues' in Mr. Justice Whittaker's opinion are his 
statement 365 U.S. at p. 344, 81 S.Ct. at p. 603, 5 L.Ed.2d 592 that the patent licensee's, C.T.R.'s, contention would involve a 
'new license' and 'another royalty' and his conclusion 365 U.S. at p. 345, 81 S.Ct. at p. 604, 5 L.Ed.2d 592 'that a license to use 
a patented combination includes the right' to repair. In his concurring opinion, Mr. Justice Black must have had the licensed 
situation in mind in asserting, at 365 U.S. at p. 360, 81 S.Ct. at p. 612, 5 L.Ed.2d 592, that 'one royalty to one patentee for one

(Kurland ed. 1960), 258, 270-278."
210,2," The general principle which the Court has stated with respect to price-fixing agreements is applicable alike to boycotts, 
divisions of markets, and tying arrangements: ""Whatever economic justification particular . . . agreements may be thought to 
have, the law does not permit an inquiry into their reasonableness.  They are all banned because of their actual or potential 
threat to the central nervous system of the economy.""  United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 224, n. 59, at 
226. "
211,3," Outside the categories of restraint which are per se unlawful, this Court has said that the question to be answered is ""whether 
the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may 
suppress or even destroy competition.  To determine that question the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the 
business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and 
its effect, actual or probable.  The history of the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, 
the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant facts.""  Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238. While the Government urges upon us the adoption of a per se rule of illegality, it nonetheless recognizes that not all the 
considerations relevant to the validity of this particular form of restraint are or could be presented by the present case: ""What is 
the importance of interbrand as opposed to intrabrand competition?  . . . Will White's restrictions remain reasonable if its share of 
the market increases?  . . . These are only a few of the issues relevant to a trial of the 'reasonableness' of any particular set of 
territorial restrictions.  Nor could one be content with a single investigation.  Business conditions change.  The effect of restricting 
competition among dealers today may be different tomorrow."" Brief for the United States, pp. 31-32."

J. 1, 113 (1959), with Robinson, Restraints on Trade and the Orderly Marketing of Goods,  45 Cornell L. Q. 254, 267-268 (1960)."
211,6," See, for an elaboration and discussion of some of the factors which might enter such an inquiry, Snap-On Tools Corp., FTC 
Docket 7116, 3 CCH Trade Reg. Rep. para. 15,546; Jordan, Exclusive and Restricted Sales Areas Under the Antitrust Laws,  9 
U. C. L. A. L. Rev. 111, 125-129 (1962). For further discussion of the reasons which make such an inquiry desirable with respect 
to restraints of this very kind, see Turner, The Definition of Agreement Under the Sherman Act: Conscious Parallelism and 
Refusals to Deal,  75 Harv. L. Rev. 655, 698-699 (1962). "
212,7," See Note, Restricted Channels of Distribution Under the Sherman Act,  75 Harv. L. Rev. 795, 800-801 (1962). It may be 
relevant to the question whether the territorial restrictions were intended to suppress price competition that appellant also 
maintained a schedule of resale prices in its distributor agreements, though there has been no challenge here to the District 
Court's finding that those provisions were unlawful per se."
212,8," For situations in which such extenuations might be relevant, compare, e. g., Packard Motor Car Co. v.  Webster Motor Car Co., 
100 U. S. App. D. C. 161, 243 F.2d 418; Schwing Motor Co. v.  Hudson Sales Corp., 138 F.Supp. 899 (D. C. D. Md.), aff'd,  239 
F.2d 176 (C. A. 4th Cir.).  In the former case the court observed, in holding an exclusive franchise arrangement not violative of 
the Sherman Act: ""The short of it is that a relatively small manufacturer, competing with large manufacturers, thought it advantageous to retain its 
largest dealer in Baltimore, and could not do so without agreeing to drop its other Baltimore dealers. To penalize the small 
manufacturer for competing in this way not only fails to promote the policy of the antitrust laws but defeats it.""  100 U. S. App. D. 
C., at 164, 243 F.2d, at 421. The doctrine of the Packard and Schwing cases is, however, of necessarily limited scope; not only 
were the manufacturers involved much smaller than the ""big three"" of the automobile industry against whom they competed, but 
both had experienced declines in their respective market shares.  And the exclusive franchises involved in those cases 
apparently were not accompanied by territorial limitations.  See Jordan, supra, note 6, at 135-139.  See, for consideration of a 
similar problem by the Federal Trade Commission,  Columbus Coated Fabrics Corp., 55 F. T. C. 1500, 1503-1504."
212,9," If the restraint is shown to be excessive for the manufacturer's needs, then its presence invites suspicion either that dealer 
pressures rather than manufacturer interests brought it about, or that the real purpose of its adoption was to restrict price "
213,," competition, cf. Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v.  United States, 309 U.S. 436, 457-459;  United States v. Masonite Corp., supra. See 
Turner, supra, note 6, at 698-699, 704-705."
213,10," In its complaint, the Government charged that any dealer or distributor who sells in another's reserved territory must pay to the 
injured distributor ""a specified amount of money for violation of said exclusive territory . . . ."" There has been no suggestion in 
this case that more drastic sanctions, such as withdrawal or cancellation of a franchise, have ever been invoked by the appellant 
to check cross-selling.  The pass-over provisions contained in the typical White contract (in a provision governing ""adjustment on 
outside deliveries"") seem representative of exclusive-territory sanctions generally employed.  See Note, Restricted Channels of 
Distribution Under the Sherman Act,  75 Harv. L. Rev. 795, 814-816 (1962)."
213,11," The District Court suggested,  194 F.Supp., at 585-586, and the Government seems to concede, that certain types of 
exclusive franchises would not violate the Sherman Act, although a determination of the legality of such arrangements would 
seem also to require an examination of their operation and effect."
213,12," See Snap-On Tools Corp., FTC Docket No. 7116, 3 CCH Trade Reg. Rep. para. 15,546, p. 20,414.  A number of consent 
decrees have recently recognized the lawfulness of area-of-primary-responsibility covenants as substitutes for the more 
restrictive exclusive arrangements.  See, e. g.,  United States v. Bostitch, Inc., CCH 1958 Trade Cases para. 69,207 (D. C. D. R. 
I.);  United States v. Rudolph Wurlitzer Co., CCH 1958 Trade Cases para. 69,011 (D. C. W. D. N. Y.).  The thrust of such 
provisions is, however, only that the dealer must adequately represent the manufacturer in the assigned area, not that he must 
stay out of other areas.  See generally  60 Mich. L. Rev. 1008 (1962)."
213,13," The essential question whether such restraints exceed the appellant's competitive needs cannot be answered, as the 
Government suggests, simply by reference to the views of major automobile manufacturers that territorial limitations are 
unnecessary to ensure effective promotion and servicing for their products.  See Hearings Before a Subcommittee of the House 
Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on Automobile Marketing Legislation, 84th Cong., pp. 160, 248, 285, 323. "
214,14," In an analogous case, brought under § 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Commission dismissed the complaint 
because of insufficient evidence that customer limitations had foreclosed meaningful competition.  In the  Matter of Roux 
Distributing Co., 55 F. T. C. 1386. The finding that non-contractual customer restrictions had a clearly anticompetitive effect in  
United States v. Klearflax Linen Looms, Inc., 63 F.Supp. 32, was one which could seemingly not have been made without a trial 
on the merits, even though the manufacturer involved held a position of virtual monopoly.  See Note, Restricted Channels of

262,1," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides in pertinent part: 'Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several 
States * * * is declared to be illegal.' Section 7 of the Clayton Act reads in pertinent part: 'No corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital 
and no corporation subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission shall acquire the whole or any part of the assets 
of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where in any line of commerce in any section of the country, the effect of 
such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.  'This section shall not apply to 
corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring about, or in 
attempting to bring about, the substantial lessening of competition.  Nor shall anything contained in this section prevent a 
corporation engaged in commerce from causing the formation of subsidiary corporations for the actual carrying on of their 
immediate lawful business, or the natural and legitimate branches or extensions thereof, or from owning and holding all or a part 
of the stock of such subsidiary corporations, when the effect of such formation is not to substantially lessen competition.' "
264,2," Defendants also argue that if these contentions are rejected. Penn-Olin must be regarded as a subsidiary of Olin and Pennsalt 
formed to carry on a lawful extension of their business, within the contemplation of the third paragraph of Section 7 of the 
Clayton Act (the second paragraph of the Act quoted in footnote 1).  Hence, it is argued that defendants have violated Section 7 
only if the effect of Penn-Olin's organization 'is' and not 'may be' substantially to lessen competition.  It is unnecessary to 
consider this point in view of the determination that the joint venture probably will not adversely affect competition."
264,3," The parties have stipulated: Olin and Pennsalt each produce and sell in commerce in the United States the following non-
chlorates: ammonia, calcium hypochlorite, caustic soda, chlorine, hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid and sulphuric acid.  
Competition, if any, in the sale of hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid is de minimus. Olin and Pennsalt compete in the sale of 
the remaining five chemicals. Of these, calcium hypochlorite has been selected as a 'guinea pig' to determine whether the joint 
venture constitutes a violation of the antitrust laws in the case of non-chlorate chemicals. The presence or absence of 
substantial competition between Olin and Pennsalt with respect to the production and sale of ammonia, caustic soda, chlorine, 
and hydrofluoric acid or of the existence of any relevant market for such chemicals, is not relevant to the determination of any 
issue in the case. "
266,4, See footnote 5. 
267,5," As a result of research which Mathieson did in chlorine dioxide, it developed the so-called Mathieson process for generating 
chlorine dioxide to bleach pulp without damaging the fibers.  The process was designed to sell sodium chlorite as a new 
commercial chemical. While the process of releasing chlorine dioxide from sodium chlorite is relatively easy and inexpensive compared to the 
generation of chlorine dioxide from sodium chlorate, in large scale production there is a three to one cost advantage in bleaching 
with chlorine dioxide made from chlorate instead of chlorate.  This led Olin to realize that sodium chlorate would soon become 
the raw material for the process.  In the early 1950's therefore Olin began to make its chlorine dioxide generation process 
available free to pulp and paper industry. "
268,6," The Government asserts that the southeastern market includes Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, 
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.  
Defendants say that Kansas, Missouri and West Texas should be excluded.  According to the Government, the exclusion of 
these two and one-half states makes scant difference.  Consequently, in the following discussion Kansas and Missouri will be 
excluded, but the whole of Texas will be included.  No evidence warrants splitting Texas and much of the evidence bearing upon 
competition treats it as an entity. "
269,7," Out of 82,094.70 tons shipped in 1960 within the United States, 47,035.76, or 57.3%, went to the southeastern market.  Of the 
remainder, 18,152.72 tons, or 22.2%, were shipped west of the Rockies, and the balance of 16,906.22, or 20.5%, went 
elsewhere."
269,8," In 1960, of the 47,035.76 tons of sodium chlorate shipped to southeastern buyers, 39,562.83 tons, or 84.1%, were purchased 
by the pulp and paper industry.  The amount so purchased represented 75.5% Of the 52,415.03 tons purchased by all of the 
pulp and paper mills in the United States."
269,9," As against the 1960 national productive capacity of 107,434 tons, plants having a tonnage capacity of 47,000 tons were in the 
southeast, viz., Hooker at Columbus, Mississippi with 32,000 tons, and AmPot at Aberdeen, Mississippi with 15,000 tons. The 
capacity of the latter was increased to 22,500 in December 1960."
269,10," See footnote 7 as to buyer concentration.  The productive capacity of the Pennsalt plant at Portland was 15,434 tons and that 
of AmPot at Henderson was 27,000 tons, making a total of 42,434 tons, as against the total national productive capacity of 
107,434 tons. "
270,11," The supply situation was to be further improved in December 1960 when AmPot's capacity at Aberdeen was increased by 
7,500 tons. This brought the total capacity of AmPot and Hooker in Mississippi up to 54,500 tons."
270,12, This is discussed in detail at p. 1108 et seq. of this opinion. 
271,13," Of this amount, 363.5 tons went to Buckeye Cellulose Company, a subsidiary of Proctor & Gamble.  Since Buckeye owned its 
own freight cars which were used to transport the sodium chlorate from Portland to Florida, the railroad made an allowance to 
Buckeye covering the cost of returning the cars to the point of origin. This circumstance, which gave Buckeye a unique 
advantage in receiving shipments from the west coast, coupled with the fact that Proctor & Gamble was an important customer 
for other products of Pennsalt, are the reasons why Pennsalt had the Buckeye account."
271,14," This is 94.9 tons more than the 363.5 tons that went to Buckeye, the Pennsalt reserved account.  It represents shipments to 
two other southeastern pulp and paper mills."
271,15," It could hardly be expected to do otherwise since the freight disadvantage in shipping from Henderson to the southeast, as 
against shipping from Aberdeen, was $ 25 to $ 30 a ton, or something in excess of 15% Of the bulk sales price of $ 163 in the 
southeastern market. "
272,16," The Post Trial Brief of the Government states (p. 1): 'This case involves a joint venture between two companies that could have competed.' The same brief states at p. 2: 'The fundamental issue posed by the trial of this case is whether the anti-trust laws condemn the entry of competitors into 
business together when, except for subjective preferences based on profitability and risk, each could have done so alone.' The Government's reply brief states (p. 30): 'When competitors and potential competitors have comparable resources and face similar hurdles, the anti-trust laws require that 
they meet these challenges on individual terms or not at all. They may compete or not as they please. But the option to compete 
or combine is forbidden."" "
273,17," Olin purchased sodium chlorate to use as a raw material in manufacturing sodium chlorite at its Niagara Falls plant. This 
sodium chlorate was purchased from Hooker's neighboring Niagra Falls plant. Pennsalt from its Portland plant could not have 
competed successfully with Hooker for Olin's business."
273,18," When the arrangement is between companies standing in a supplier-customer relationship it is characterized as vertical; 
when between companies performing similar functions in the production or sale of comparable goods or services, it is said to be 
horizontal.  Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, supra, 370 U.S. pp. 323, 334, 82 S.Ct. pp. 1522, 1523. "

274,560,"  Larger quantities of sodium chlorate sold in the United States, but produced outside of the United States, from 1959 to 1960, 
have been stipulated not to be substantial. "
276,20," Evidence of the intention of parties to a combination is an aid in predicting their probable future conduct and the probable 
effect of the combination. See Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, supra, 370 U.S. p. 329, n. 48, 82 S.Ct. p. 1526."
276,21," An additional argument is that the practical effect of Penn-Olin was to bring about an allocation of markets between Olin and 
Pennsalt. Thus, it is said that the joint interest of the companies in Penn-Olin will necessarily prevent Pennsalt from competing 
from its Portland plant for business in the southeast, and has foreclosed Olin form competing for west coast business from the 
plaint which, but for Penn-Olin, it would have built in the southeast. This argument assumes a national market of competitive 
effectiveness. The absence of such a market invalidates the argument. "
277,22," Osborne, the President of Penn-Olin, testified that Olin's decision to enter the joint venture was made without determination 
that Olin could not or would not be lan independent competitor. He testified that that question ""never reached the point of final 
decision."" Pennsalt asserts that on December 5, 1957 its management made its final decision that it should not build a plant of its own and 
that this decision was never considered or changed.  The view that the December 5, 1957 decision was final is rejected. The 
record is replete with evidence that after December 5, 1957 Pennsalt continued to manifest an interest in an independent sodium 
chlorate venture, although this was primarily in the posture of a combined sodium chlorate-ammonium perchlorate plant. The 
consideration which was given to the ammonium perchlorate aspect of the venture was basically to support the manufacture of 
sodium chlorate. Ammonium perchlorate was viewed as a ""sweetener"" to justify the investment economically, since ammonium 
perchlorate, as compared with sodium chlorate, yielded a relatively high rate of return on the investment. In December 1958 the management of Pennsalt agreed to launch a full-scale effort to determine the feasibility of a sodium 
chlorate-ammonium perchlorate plant. This effort was not made because in January 1959 Pennsalt resumed joint venture 
discussions with Olin. The January 1959 minutes of the Appropriation Committee of Pennsalt indicate that if Olin was not 
desirous of proceeding with the joint venture, data on doing the project alone should be resubmitted to the committee. As late as 
December 30, 1959, Land, General Manager, Industrial Chemicals Division East, was still of the view that no final decision had 
been made whether Pennsalt would build its own plant. "
278,23," For instance, the so-called Whither Report of the Chemical Division of Olin dated April 10, 1959 disclosed that if Olin built a 
15,000 ton sodium chlorate plant at Mackintosh, Alabama, it could be expected to show a profit after taxes equal to 11% on the 
gross investment of $ 4,100,000. A revision of the Report in October 1959 revealed that if Olin constructed a combined sodium 
chlorate chlorine-caustic plant at Chattanooga, Tennessee, the investment of $ 3,590,000 attributed to the 15,000 ton sodium 
chlorate facility would yield an after-tax profit of 13.1%. A study made by Pennsalt in 1959 for a combined sodium chlorate-ammonium perchlorate plant at Calver City, Kentucky 
showed that the $ 6,961,300 investment cost assigned to the 25,000 ton sodium chlorate phase would yield a 15.9% after-tax 
return. Although both companies made a number of studies of the potential profit to be derived from a sodium chlorate plant and the 
anticipated yield on investment was not uniform, each of the studies forecast a profit."
278,24," Section 7 is not concerned with possibilities of competition being substantially lessened; its aim is directed against 
combinations that probably will have that result.  Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, supra, 370 U.S. p. 323, 82 S.Ct. p. 1522."
278,25, The Transcript of Argument reads at pp. 125-126: 
279,," ""THE COURT: Let me ask you: If I should come to the conclusion that as a metter of reasonable probability, absent the joint 
venture, Olin would have constructed a factory and sold its products in the southeast, if I should come to that conclusion, does 
the Government contend that from that the Government must * * * win?"" ""MR. FREED: Yes. ""THE COURT: Let me ask you: Isn't there a further question as to whether or not the construction of a plant by Olin, sales of 
products by Olin in the southeast, would have produced a more competitive situation than did the joint venture? ""MR. FREED: No, Your Honor, that would not be a legitimate question. it is not for the Government and it is not for the courts to 
weigh the advantages of comninations of competitors and what they give to the economy, and what individual companies give to 
the economy. * * * "" In arguing that competition created by the joint venture is irrelevant, the Government cites United States v. Minnesota Mining & 
Manufacturing Co., 92 F.Supp. 947 (D.Mass.1950) as an ""important precedent"". If the decision is susceptible of the 
interpretation which the Government gives it, it is inconsistent with the views herein expressed.  United States v. Bethlehem 
Steel Corp., supra, 168 F.Supp. pp. 615-618, the other case relied upon by the Government, is clearly inapposite. "
280,26, To be achieved gradually on a stepped-up basis. 
281,27," Although this was after suit had been begun on January 6, 1961, Olin had determined internally in 1960 that the joint venture 
should be restricted to sodium chlorate."

285,32," Ammonium perchlorate is used as an oxidizer for high energy solid state missile propellants.  Sodium chlorate is the raw 
material out of which ammonium perchlorate is made.  The profit obtainable from the latter was much greater than that which 
could be derived from the former.  A plant which produced both products would yield an overall rate of return satisfactory to 
Pennsalt. "

298,," HN2[
] Section 24200 in relevant part provides: ""The following are the grounds which constitute a basis for the suspension or the revocation of licenses: (a) When the continuance of a license would be contrary to public welfare or morals; but proceedings 
under this section upon this ground are not a limitation upon the department's authority to proceed under Article XX, Section 22 
of the Constitution."" California Constitution, article XX, section 22 in relevant part provides: ""The department shall have the power, in its discretion, to 
deny, suspend or revoke any specific alcoholic beverage license if it shall determine for good cause that the granting or 
continuance of such license would be contrary to public welfare or morals, . . ."""
298,2," Section 24200 provides in relevant part: ""The following are the grounds which constitute a basis for the suspension or the 
revocation of licenses: . . . (b) Except as limited by Chapters 11 and 12 of this division, the violation or the causing or the 
permitting of a violation by a licensee of this division, . . . or any rules of the department adopted pursuant to the provisions of 
this division, or any other penal provisions of law of this State prohibiting or regulating the sale . . . of alcoholic beverages or 
intoxicating liquors."""
298,3," The matter was submitted below on the petition, return, and record of the administrative proceedings had before the 
Department which included a transcript of the oral proceedings and certain documentary evidence received.  The entire 
administrative file, together with the opinion of the Appeals Board, has been transmitted here."
298,4," The finding did not extend to all items of alcoholic beverages involved.  The court found there was substantial evidence that the 
minimum retail prices of three brands of beverages and the schedules filed with the Department were fixed and agreed upon 
between the manufacturers or brand owners and retail off-sale licensees. "
299,5," As pointed out above (see footnote 4) the relevant finding in the trial court was unfavorable to the Department on all but three 
items set forth in the accusation."
299,6, The Department makes no argument on the ninth count which was reversed by the Appeals Board.
299,7," It is unnecessary to detail the licensees' meticulous objections to each item of documentary evidence.  Generally speaking, 
they were made on the grounds that the fair trade contracts were not in fact contracts because the parties thereto made no 
engagement to sell or buy to or from each other; that the contracts created no mutually binding obligations; that the parties 
signatory to the agreements did not in every instance agree to the fair trade prices revised and appended to the agreements 
after their execution; and that there was no showing that the beverages listed in the agreements were, at the time of the sales 
involved, in fair and open competition with alcoholic beverages of the same general class produced by others."
299,8," The certification made under oath by the special assistant to the Director of Alcoholic Beverage Control states that such person 
is the ""legal custodian of the fair trade contracts and fair trade contract price schedules required by law to be filed with the 
Department.  . . ."" "
300,9," HN6[
] Section 24750 provides: ""No contract relating to the sale or resale of any alcoholic beverage which bears, or the label or container of which bears, the trade-mark, brand, or name of the producer or owner of the alcoholic beverage and which is in 
fair and open competition with alcoholic beverages of the same general class produced by others violates any law of this State 
by reason of either of the following provisions which may be contained in such contract: ""(a) That the buyer will not resell the alcoholic beverage except at the price stipulated by the vendor. ""(b) That the producer or vendee of the alcoholic beverage require, upon the sale of the alcoholic beverage to another, that the 
purchaser agree that he will not, in turn, resell except at the price stipulated by the producer or vendee."""
300,10," Section 24755, at the times here involved, read as follows: ""All distilled spirits sold at retail shall be, and any other alcoholic 
beverage may be, sold pursuant to a contract executed pursuant to this chapter, except that Chapter 11 shall govern the sale of 
wine in all cases in which that chapter is applicable.  No licensee shall violate any of the provisions of any such contract."" The foregoing section was repealed in 1961 (Stats. 1961, ch. 635, § 3) and a new section bearing the same number added 
(Stats. 1961, ch. 635, § 4), which, in respect to distilled spirits bearing the brand, trademark or name of the owner or person in 
control, prohibits any retail sale for consumption off the licensed premises unless a minimum retail price has first been filed with 
the Department pursuant to the section and further prohibits any sale by an off-sale licensee ""at any price less than the effective 
filed price."" "
301,11," Former rule 99, subdivisions (a), (b) and (f) in relevant part provided: ""(a) No manufacturer, manufacturer's agent, wholesaler 
or rectifier shall sell distilled spirits the containers of which bear labels stating the brand or name of the owner or producer, in this 
State, except pursuant to a fair trade contract, as provided for by Sections 24750 to 24755 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control 
Act. ""(b) Every manufacturer, manufacturer's agent, wholesaler, or rectifier licensed in this State who owns or controls a brand of 
distilled spirits, or who is properly authorized to fair trade a brand of distilled spirits in this State, shall file with the department a 
copy of a fair trade contract, or a notice of the amendment of an existing fair trade contract, and four copies of minimum resale 
price schedules.  . . . ""(f) No licensee shall advertise or offer for sale, or sell, alcoholic beverages at retail at a price less than the stipulated minimum 
resale price provided for by a fair trade contract filed with the department pursuant to this rule."" (This rule has been revised and recast.  As presently in effect, it provides inter alia for the filing of a ""Distilled Spirits Minimum 
Retail Price Schedule"" and prohibits sales by off-sale licensees at a price less than that filed with the Department unless written 
permission is granted.)"
301,12," Allied Properties was decided on November 30, 1959, thus disposing of the licensees' contention made in their amended 
notice of defense filed in the administrative proceedings on November 6, 1957, that section 24755 and rule 99 were 
unconstitutional.  Although the licensees restated this contention in their petition for writ of mandate filed March 29, 1960, 
subsequent to the Allied Properties decision, they have not pressed such contention before us."
301,13," Items involved were: White Horse Scotch, Old Charter straight bourbon, Jim Beam straight bourbon, Paul Jones blended 
whiskey, Old Crow straight bourbon, Johnny Walker Red Label Scotch whiskey, Old Hermitage blended whiskey, I. W. Harper 
bonded bourbon, Canada Dry blended whiskey and Canada Dry Gin."
301,14," This wholesaler's form of fair trade agreement was introduced in evidence apparently because its attached price list fixed not 
only the ""owners'"" prevailing prices to wholesalers and retailers but also the ""owners'"" resale prices to consumers in California. "
302,15," Illustrative of the retailer's covenant is the following paragraph from the fair trade agreement fixing the fair trade price for White 
Horse Scotch Whiskey, an item alleged in the first count of the accusation: ""Purchaser agrees that he will not sell advertise for 
sale or offer to sell any person, firm or corporation, any of the products named in the Resale Price Schedule as now filed or 
hereafter amended at prices below those therein specified.  Seller further agrees that he will not use any of the products listed in 
any free deals, or make or offer to make any refunds discounts or concessions, or make or offer to make combination sales or 
transactions which shall result in a reduction of the resale prices therein established."""
302,16," Although there is a variation of language among all agreements, the above is a fair summary of their salient features.  It is to 
be noted that the reserved right in the seller to revise the schedule of prices and the agreement of the buyer to be bound thereby 
are present in all contracts. "
303,17," Our attention has also been directed to the opinion of the Appeals Board in an unrelated case (Appeal of Moeslein, No. AB-
794) in which it was held that there was no requirement that fair trade contracts be also contracts for the sale of distilled spirits. "
304,18," Rule 99(b) required the filing with the Department of a copy of the contract and four copies of minimum resale price schedules.  
Attached to each of six of the contracts in evidence as part of the exhibits is a schedule of prices entitled ""Distilled Spirits Fair 
Trade Schedule."" "
306,19," HN14[
]  Government Code section 11515 in relevant part states: ""Parties present at the hearing shall be informed of the matters to be noticed, and those matters shall be noted in the record, referred to therein, or appended thereto.  Any such party 
shall be given a reasonable opportunity on request to refute the officially noticed matters by evidence or by written or oral 
presentation of authority, the manner of such refutation to be determined by the agency."" "
307,20," That portion of rule 99(b) relevant here provided as follows: ""Amendments to such contracts affecting changes in minimum 
resale prices for a brand, type and size of container previously filed shall be filed with the department on or before the fifteenth 
day of any calendar month to become effective on the first day of the second succeeding calendar month.  To meet competitive 
prices for similar distilled spirits, amendments to fair trade contracts may be filed with the department on or before the fifteenth 
day of any calendar month and such amended competitive price shall become effective at the same time the competitive price 
for similar distilled spirits shall become effective."" For portions of rule 99 heretofore set forth, see footnote 11, supra."
307,21," For example, the finding with respect to Count I was as follows: ""It is true that on or about August 28, 1956, the above-named 
licensee, at the above-mentioned premises, did sell alcoholic beverages, to-wit, Scotch Whiskey, at retail to the W. P. Fuller 
Company, 301 Mission Street, San Francisco, at a price less than the stipulated minimum resale price provided for in a fair trade 
contract duly filed with the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control as follows: . . ."" Description of brands and prices follows. "
308,22," In Jones v. Maloney (1951) 106 Cal.App.2d 80, 89-90 [234 P.2d 666], this court said that such ""determination"" was 
comparable to a trial court's ""conclusions of law."""
308,23," Rule 17(e) as it then read provided: ""(e) No alcoholic beverage shall leave the premises of an off-sale licensee for delivery to a 
consumer, except pursuant to an order previously received by such licensee. Such alcoholic beverages shall be accompanied 
by a delivery order, which order must state the quantity, brand, proof, and price of such alcoholic beverages, and the name and 
address of the consumer purchaser, and shall have printed or stamped thereon the name and address of such off-sale licensee. 
A copy of such order shall be kept on file by the off-sale licensee for a period of two years after the date of delivery."" "
328,1," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides in pertinent part: HN1[
] ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, 
or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" 
Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended in 1950 by the Celler-Kefauver Antimerger Act, provides in pertinent part: HN2[
] ""No 
corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital 
and no corporation subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission shall acquire the whole or any part of the assets 
of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where in any line of commerce in any section of the country, the effect of 
such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly."""

329,3," In addition, there is a certain amount of bank holding company activity.  The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, 12 U. S. C. 
§§ 1841-1848, brought bank holding companies under stringent federal regulation.  As of 1958, the 43 registered bank holding 
companies controlled 5.7% of all banking offices and 7.4% of all deposits. Lent, The Changing Structure of Commercial Banking 
(1960), 19.  See also Comment, supra, note 2,  71 Yale L. J., at 516-522."
329,4," Such creation is not, to be sure, pure sleight of hand.  A bank may not make a loan without adequate reserves.  Nevertheless, 
the element of bank money creation is real.  E. g., Samuelson, Economics (5th ed. 1961), 331-343."
329,5," The principal banking ""products"" are of course various types of credit, for example: unsecured personal and business loans, 
mortgage loans, loans secured by securities or accounts receivable, automobile installment and consumer goods installment 
loans, tuition financing, bank credit cards, revolving credit funds.  Banking services include: acceptance of demand deposits from 
individuals, corporations, governmental agencies, and other banks; acceptance of time and savings deposits; estate and trust 
planning and trusteeship services; lock boxes and safety-deposit boxes; account reconciliation services; foreign department 
services (acceptances and letters of credit); correspondent services; investment advice.  It should be noted that many other 
institutions are in the business of supplying credit, and so more or less in competition with commercial banks (see further, pp. 
356-357, infra), for example: mutual savings banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, personal-finance companies, 
sales-finance companies, private businessmen (through the furnishing of trade credit), factors, direct-lending government 
agencies, the Post Office, Small Business Investment Corporations, life insurance companies. "
331,6," In 1957, for example, there were three bank suspensions in the entire country by reason of financial difficulties; in 1960, two; 
and in 1961, nine.  Of these nine, four involved state banks which were neither members of the FRS nor insured by the FDIC.  
1961 Annual Report of the Comptroller of the Currency 286.  In a typical year in the 1920's, roughly 600 banks failed throughout 
the country, about 100 of them national banks.  See S. Rep. No. 196, Regulation of Bank Mergers, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 17-18."
331,7," The proposed ""merger"" of appellees is technically a consolidation, since the resulting bank will be a different entity from either 
of the constituent banks, whereas if the transaction were a merger, Girard would disappear into PNB and PNB would survive.  
However, the proposed transaction resembles a merger very closely, in that PNB's shareholders are not to surrender their 
present share certificates and the resulting bank is to operate under PNB's charter.  In any event, the statute treats mergers and 
consolidations essentially alike, compare 12 U. S. C. (1958 ed., Supp. IV) § 215 with § 215a, and it is not suggested that the 
legal question of the instant case would be affected by whether the transaction is technically a merger or a consolidation. 
Therefore, throughout this opinion we use the term ""merger."""
331,8, Section 1828 (c) provides in pertinent part: 
332,," HN3[
] ""No insured [by FDIC] bank shall merge or consolidate with any other insured bank or, either directly or indirectly, 
acquire the assets of, or assume liability to pay any deposits made in, any other insured bank without the prior written consent (i) 
of the Comptroller of the Currency if the acquiring, assuming, or resulting bank is to be a national bank or a District [of Columbia] 
bank, or (ii) of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System if the acquiring, assuming, or resulting bank is to be a 
State member bank (except a District bank), or (iii) of the [Federal Deposit Insurance] Corporation if the acquiring, assuming, or 
resulting bank is to be a nonmember insured bank (except a District bank). . . .  In granting or withholding consent under this 
subsection, the Comptroller, the Board, or the Corporation, as the case may be, shall consider the financial history and condition 
of each of the banks involved, the adequacy of its capital structure, its future earnings prospects, the general character of its 
management, the convenience and needs of the community to be served, and whether or not its corporate powers are 
consistent with the purposes of this chapter.  In the case of a merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets, or assumption of 
liabilities, the appropriate agency shall also take into consideration the effect of the transaction on competition (including any 
tendency toward monopoly), and shall not approve the transaction unless, after considering all of such factors, it finds the 
transaction to be in the public interest. In the interests of uniform standards, before acting on a merger, consolidation, acquisition 
of assets, or assumption of liabilities under this subsection, the agency (unless it finds that it must act immediately in order to 
prevent the probable failure of one of the banks involved) shall request a report on the competitive factors involved from the 
Attorney General and the other two banking agencies referred to in this subsection . . . .  The Comptroller, the Board, and the 
Corporation shall each include in its annual report to the Congress a description of each merger, consolidation, acquisition of 
assets, or assumption of liabilities approved by it during the period covered by the report, along with the following information: . . 
. a statement by the Comptroller, the Board, or the Corporation, as the case may be, of the basis for its approval."""
332,9," See 12 U. S. C. § 84, p. 329, supra.  The resulting bank would have a lending limit of $ 15,000,000, of which $ 1,000,000 would 
not be attributable to the merger but to unrelated accounting factors."
332,10," There was evidence that Philadelphia, although it ranks fourth or fifth among the Nation's urban areas in terms of general 
commercial activity, ranks only ninth in terms of the size of its largest bank, and that some large business firms which have their 
head offices in Philadelphia must seek elsewhere to satisfy their banking needs because of the inadequate lending limits of "
333,," Philadelphia's banks; First Pennsylvania and PNB, currently the two largest banks in Philadelphia, each have a lending limit of $ 
8,000,000.  Girard's is $ 6,000,000. Appellees offered testimony that the merger would enable certain economies of scale, specifically, that it would enable the 
formation of a more elaborate foreign department than either bank is presently able to maintain.  But this attempted justification, 
which was not mentioned by the District Court in its opinion and has not been developed with any fullness before this Court, we 
consider abandoned."
333,11," We reject the argument that § 11 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 21, confers jurisdiction over banks upon the 
FTC.  That section provides in pertinent part: ""Authority to enforce compliance with sections 13, 14, 18, and 19 of this title [§§ 2, 
3, 7, and 8 of the Clayton Act, as amended] by the persons respectively subject thereto is vested . . . in the Federal Reserve 
Board where applicable to banks, banking associations, and trust companies; and in the Federal Trade Commission where 
applicable to all other character of commerce . . . ."" The argument is that since the FRB has no authority to enforce the Clayton 
Act against bank mergers, see note 22, infra, bank mergers must fall into the residual category of ""all other character of 
commerce"" and so be subject to the FTC.  However, there is no intimation in the legislative history of the 1950 amendment to §§ 
7 and 11 that the FTC's traditional lack of jurisdiction over banks was to be disturbed.  Moreover, it is clear from the language of 
§ 11 that ""banks, banking associations, and trust companies"" are meant to comprise a distinct ""character of commerce,"" and so 
cannot be part of the ""other character of commerce"" reserved to the FTC. The exclusion of banks from the FTC's jurisdiction appears to have been motivated by the fact that banks were already subject 
to extensive federal administrative controls.  See  T. C. Hurst & Son v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 268 F. 874, 877 (D. C. E. D. Va. 
1920)."
333,12," No argument is made in this case that banking is not commerce, and therefore that § 7 is inapplicable; plainly, such an 
argument would have no merit.  See Transamerica Corp. v.  Board of Govs. of Fed. Res. Sys., 206 F.2d 163, 166 (C. A. 3d Cir. 
1953); cf.   United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Assn., 322 U.S. 533."
333,13," ""A merger necessarily involves the complete disappearance of one of the merging corporations.  A sale of assets, on the other 
hand, may involve no more than a substitution of cash for some part of the selling company's properties, with no change in 
corporate structure and no change in stockholder interests.  Shareholders of merging corporations surrender their interests in 
those corporations in exchange for their very different rights in the resulting corporation.  In an asset acquisition, however, the 
shareholders of the selling corporation obtain no interest in the purchasing corporation and retain no interest in the assets "
334,," transferred.  In a merger, unlike an asset acquisition, the resulting firm automatically acquires all the rights, powers, franchises, 
liabilities, and fiduciary rights and obligations of the merging firms.  In a merger, but not in an asset acquisition, there is the 
likelihood of a continuity of management and other personnel.  Finally, a merger, like a stock acquisition, necessarily involves 
the acquisition by one corporation of an immediate voice in the management of the business of another corporation; no voice in 
the decisions of another corporation is acquired by purchase of some part of its assets."" Brief for the United States, 75-76."
334,14," ""[A] merger such as appellees' may be effected upon the affirmative vote of the holders of only two-thirds of the outstanding 
stock of each bank . . . but if PNB were acquiring all of the Girard stock each Girard shareholder could decide for himself 
whether to transfer his shares.  A merger requires public notice whereas stock can be acquired privately.  A shareholder 
dissenting from a merger has the right to receive the appraised value of his shares . . . whereas no shareholder has a 
comparable right in an acquisition of stock. Furthermore the corporate existence of a merged company is terminated by a 
merger, but remains unaffected by an acquisition of stock."" Brief for Appellees, 30-31."
334,15," The legislative history of the 1914 Act is reviewed in Brown Shoe Co. v.  United States, 370 U.S. 294, 313-314, and notes 22-
24."
334,16," In the case of an acquisition like the instant one, in which shares in the acquired corporation are to be exchanged for shares in 
the resulting corporation, a fortiori we discern no difficulty in conceptualizing the transaction as a ""stock acquisition."" Compare 
note 13, supra. "
335,17," Statements to the same effect may be found in, e. g., Brown Shoe Co., supra, at 313-314, 316;  United States v. E. I. du Pont 
de Nemours & Co., 353 U.S. 586, 592;  United States v. Columbia Steel Co., 334 U.S. 495, 507, n. 7;  United States v. Columbia 
Pictures Corp., 189 F.Supp. 153, 182 (D. C. S. D. N. Y. 1960). See also  33 Op. Atty. Gen. 225, 241 (1922); Hernacki,

History,  52 Col. L. Rev. 766, 768-769 (1952). Actually, the holdings in the three cases that reached this Court, Thatcher, Swift, and Arrow-Hart, were quite narrow.  See 
generally Note,  26 Col. L. Rev. 594-596 (1926). They were based not on a lack of substantive power under § 7, but on the 
enforcement section, § 11, which limited the FTC's remedial powers to ""an order requiring such person to cease and desist from 
such violations [of §§ 2, 3, 7, and 8 of the Clayton Act], and divest itself of the stock held or rid itself of the directors chosen 
contrary to the provisions of sections seven and eight of this Act."" 38 Stat. 735.  Faced with Congress' evident refusal to confer 
upon the FTC the ordinary powers of a court of equity, this Court held that unless the assets were acquired after the FTC's order 
of stock divestiture had been issued (which was the case in  Federal Trade Comm'n v. Western Meat Co., supra, where the 
Commission was sustained), the Commission could not order a divestiture of assets.  Compare Board of Govs. of Fed. Res. 
Sys. v.  Transamerica Corp., 184 F.2d 311 (C. A. 9th Cir. 1950), with  Federal Trade Comm'n v. International Paper Co., 241 
F.2d 372 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1956). Since under this Court's decisions the FTC was powerless even where the transfer of assets was 
an evasive maneuver aimed at defeating the FTC's remedial jurisdiction over stock acquisitions violative of § 7, a fortiori the 
Commission was powerless against the typical merger. See Arrow-Hart & Hegeman Elec. Co. v.  Federal Trade Comm'n, supra, 
at 595, 598-599. As part of the 1950 amendments to the Clayton Act, § 11 was amended to read: ""an order requiring such 
person to . . . divest itself of the stock, or other share capital, or assets, held . . . ."" 15 U. S. C. § 21. Whether as an original 
matter Thatcher, Swift and Arrow-Hart were correctly decided is no longer an open question, since they were the explicit premise 
of the 1950 amendment to § 7.  See State Bd. of Ins. v.  Todd Shipyards Corp., 370 U.S. 451, 458, p. 349, infra. The question of the FTC's remedial powers under § 11 of the Clayton Act is to be distinguished from that of its remedial powers 
under § 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U. S. C. § 45 (b).  In  Federal Trade Comm'n v. Eastman Kodak Co., 274 
U.S. 619, the Court, relying on Thatcher and Swift, held that the Commission had no power to order divestiture in § 5 
proceedings.  But cf. Gilbertville Trucking Co. v.  United States, 371 U.S. 115, 129-131;  Pan American World Airways v. United 
States, 371 U.S. 296, 312, and n. 17."
335,18," See note 1, supra, for text of amended § 7.  The original § 7 read in pertinent part: ""no corporation engaged in commerce shall 
acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in 
commerce, where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock 
is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition, or to restrain such commerce in any section or community, or tend to 
create a monopoly of any line of commerce."" The passage of the 1950 amendment followed many years of unsuccessful attempts to enact legislation plugging the assets-
acquisition loophole. See Note,  52 Col. L. Rev. 766-767, notes 3 and 4 (1952).  To be sure, the 1950 amendment was intended 
not only to enlarge the number of transactions covered by § 7 but also to change the test of illegality.  The legislative history 
pertinent to the latter point is reviewed in Brown Shoe Co., supra, at 315-323, and is not directly relevant to the present 
discussion. "
336,19," ""The purpose of the proposed legislation [the 1950 amendments to § 7] is to prevent corporations from acquiring another 
corporation by means of the acquisition of its assets, whereunder [sic] the present law it is prohibited from acquiring the stock of 
said corporation.  Since the acquisition of stock is significant chiefly because it is likely to result in control of the underlying 
assets, failure to prohibit direct purchase of the same assets has been inconsistent and paradoxical as to the over-all effect of 
existing law."" S. Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 2.  This theme pervaded congressional consideration of the proposed 
amendments.  See, e. g., H. R. Rep. No. 1191, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., passim; Hearing before Subcommittee No. 3 of the House 
Committee on the Judiciary on Amending Sections 7 and 11 of the Clayton Act, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., ser. 10, pp. 11-13, 28-29,

bill to amend § 7 in the House: ""this bill seeks to plug a loophole in the present antitrust laws. . . .  It is time to stop, look, and 
listen and to call a halt to the merger movement that is going on in this country""), 11493-11494, 11497, 11502; 96 Cong. Rec.

336,20," Columbia Steel involved the cash purchase by United States Steel Corporation of the physical assets of Consolidated Steel 
Corporation; there was no exchange of shares and no alteration of Consolidated's corporate identity.  See Transcript of Record,  
United States v. Columbia Steel Co., 334 U.S. 495 (No. 461, October Term, 1947), pp. 453-475.  As a result of the purchase, in 
its horizontal aspect, U.S. Steel controlled about 24% of the structural steel fabricating market in an 11-state western area.  This 
Court held that the acquisition could not be reached under § 7 of the  Clayton Act, see 334 U.S., at 507, n. 7, and did not violate 
the Sherman Act. It should be noted, however, that the Court regarded the 24% market-share figure proposed by the 
Government as a ""doubtful assumption"" and also pointed to ""unusual conditions"" tending to mitigate the anticompetitive effect of 
the acquisition.  334 U.S., at 529. Columbia Steel was repeatedly cited by Congressmen considering the amendment of § 7 as 
an example of what they conceived to be the inability of the Sherman Act, as then construed, to deal with the problems of 
corporate concentration. See, e. g., H. R. Rep. No. 1191, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 10-11, and n. 16; Hearing before Subcommittee 
No. 3 of the House Committee on the Judiciary on Amending Sections 7 and 11 of the Clayton Act, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., ser. 
10, pp. 28, 73; Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on Corporate Mergers and 
Acquisitions, 81st Cong., 1st and 2d Sess. 24; 96 Cong. Rec. 16453 (Senator Kefauver, Senate sponsor of the bill to amend § 7: 
""the Columbia Steel Co. case is a vivid illustration of the necessity for the proposed amendment of the Clayton Act""), 16503; and 
cf. 96 Cong. Rec. 16498-16499."
336,21," See note 19, supra.  The congressional attitude toward this Court's Thatcher, Swift, and Arrow-Hart decisions is typified in this 
remark of Senator O'Conor's: ""The Court, in effect, said that the [Federal Trade] Commission was quite free to use the power 
which Congress had conferred upon it, so long as it confined the use of that power to ordering the divestiture of pieces of paper 
which happened to be worthless."" 96 Cong. Rec. 16433.  Senator O'Mahoney remarked, for example, that there was ""no doubt "
337,," of the fundamental fact that an innocent defect in the drafting of section 7 of the Clayton Act back in 1914 had resulted in 
creating a great opportunity for escape by flagrant violators of the law."" 96 Cong. Rec. 16443.  After sharply criticizing this 
Court's decisions, the Senator continued: ""I take it the record is perfectly clear that what this bill purports to do is to correct an 
omission in the original Clayton Act. When the authors of the Clayton Act and the Congress which passed it enacted the bill into 
law they thought they were giving the Federal Trade Commission administrative authority to prevent monopolistic mergers . . . ."" 
Ibid.  So also, Senator Kefauver observed: ""it would have been much better for the economy of the country to have repealed 
sections 7 and 11 of the Clayton Act rather than let this wide-open loophole to remain.  Most of the large and monopolistic 
mergers which have become detrimental to the free-enterprise system of our Nation have occurred by way of this plain evasion 
of the intent of the original Clayton Act."" 96 Cong. Rec. 16451."
337,22," A cash purchase of another bank's assets would not seem to be a fully effective method of corporate acquisition. In other 
industries, a cash purchase of plant, inventory, patents, trade secrets, and the like will often directly enhance the competitive 
position of the acquiring corporation, as in Columbia Steel Co. But a bank desiring to increase its share of banking business 
through corporate acquisition would ordinarily need to acquire the other bank's deposits and capital, not merely its assets.  For 
more deposits mean more working capital, and additions to capital and surplus increase the lending limit.  A cash purchase, in 
effect, only substitutes cash for cash, since bank assets consist principally of cash and very liquid securities and loans 
receivable, and adds nothing to the acquiring bank's capital and surplus or to its working capital.  True, an exchange of its stock 
for assets would achieve the acquiring bank's objectives.  We are clear, however, that in light of Congress' overriding purpose, in 
amending § 7, to close the loophole in the original section, if such an exchange (or other clearly evasive transaction) were 
tantamount in its effects to a merger, the exchange would not be an ""assets"" acquisition within the meaning of § 7 but would be 
treated as a transaction subject to that section. We have not overlooked the fact that there are corporations in other industries not subject to the FTC's jurisdiction.  Chief among 
these are air carriers subject to the Civil Aeronautics Board and other carriers subject to the Interstate Commerce Commission.  
Both agencies have been given, expressly, broad powers to exempt mergers and acquisitions in whatever form from the antitrust 
laws. See 49 U. S. C. §§ 1378, 1384; 49 U. S. C. § 5 (11) and (13).  Therefore, the exclusion of assets acquisitions in such 
industries from § 7 would seem to have little significance. Section 11 of the Clayton Act, 15 U. S. C. § 21, vests the FRB with authority to enforce § 7 ""where applicable to banks."" This 
provision has been in the Act since it was first passed in 1914 and was not changed by the 1950 amendments.  The Bank 
Merger Act of 1960, assigning roles in merger applications to the FDIC and the Comptroller of the Currency as well as to the 
FRB, plainly supplanted, we think, whatever authority the FRB may have acquired under § 11, by virtue of the amendment of § 
7, to enforce § 7 against bank mergers. Since the Bank Merger Act applies only to mergers, consolidations, acquisitions of 
assets, and assumptions of liabilities but not to outright stock acquisitions, the FRB's authority under § 11 as it existed before the 
1950 amendment of § 7 remains unaffected.  See, e. g., Transamerica Corp. v.  Board of Govs. of Fed. Res. Sys., 206 F.2d 163 
(C. A. 3d Cir. 1953). Nothing in this opinion, of course, limits the power of the FTC, under §§ 7 and 11, as amended, to reach any transaction, 
including mergers and consolidations, in the broad range between and including pure stock and pure assets acquisitions, where 
the acquiring corporation is subject to the FTC's jurisdiction, see 15 U. S. C. § 45 (a)(6), and to order divestiture of the stock, 
share capital, or assets acquired in the transaction, see 15 U. S. C. § 21. "
338,23," See, e. g., statement of Assistant Attorney General Bergson: ""If it [§ 7] is to have any significant effect for the future, it is 
essential that it be amended so that the Federal Trade Commission will be in a position to deal with the merger problem as it 
exists today."" Hearing before Subcommittee No. 3 of the House Committee on the Judiciary on Amending Sections 7 and 11 of

of stock. This would close the loophole and restore meaning to the statute.""). "

341,32," In  California v. Federal Power Comm'n, supra, the Court held that the FPC must stay its proceeding on a merger application 
until the completion of a pending antitrust suit by the Justice Department; a fortiori, the court entertaining the suit would not be 
required to abstain pending consideration of the merger application by the FPC.  We need not and do not consider the question 
whether the California decision would control here had the Comptroller been denied an opportunity to approve the merger before 
the antitrust suit was commenced. "
342,33," Cf.   United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416, 425 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1945). In the instant case, unlike Aluminum 
Co., there is virtually no time lag between the banks' furnishing competing financial institutions (small-loan companies, for 
example) with the raw material, i. e., money, and the institutions' selling the finished product, i. e., loans; hence the instant case, 
compared with Aluminum Co. in this respect, is a fortiori.  As one banker testified quite frankly in the instant case in response to 
the question: ""Do you feel that you are in substantial competition with these institutions [personal-finance and sales-finance 
companies] that you lend . . . such money to for loans that you want to make?"" -- ""Oh, no, we definitely do not.  If we did, we 
would stop making the loans to them."" (R. 298.) The reason for the competitive disadvantage of most lending institutions vis-a-
vis banks is that only banks obtain the bulk of their working capital without having to pay interest or comparable charges thereon, 
by virtue of their unique power to accept demand deposits. The critical area of short-term commercial credit, see pp. 326-327, 
supra, appears to be one in which banks have little effective competition, save in the case of very large companies which can 
meet their financing needs from retained earnings or from issuing securities or paper."
342,34," As one witness for the defendants testified: ""We have had in Philadelphia for 50 years or more the mutual savings banks offering 1/2 per cent and in some instances more 
than 1/2 per cent higher interest than the commercial banks.  Nevertheless, the rate of increase in savings accounts in "
343,," commercial banks has kept pace with and in many of the banks exceeded the rate of increase of the mutual banks paying 3 1/2 
per cent. . . . ""I have made some inquiries.  There are four banks on the corner of Broad and Chestnut.  Three of them are commercial banks 
all offering 3 per cent, and one is a mutual savings bank offering 3 1/2.  As far as I have been able to discover, there isn't 
anybody in Philadelphia who will take the trouble to walk across Broad Street to get 1/2 of 1 per cent more interest.  If you ask 
me why, I will say I do not know.  Habit, custom, personal relationships, convenience, doing all your banking under one roof 
appear to be factors superior to changes in the interest rate level."" (R. 1388-1389.)"
343,35," Consider the following colloquy between governmental counsel and a witness for the defendants: ""Q. What do you consider to be the area of a branch office? ""A. Well, there is no set rule on that.  We hope to have an area from 1 1/2 to 2 miles. ""However, we have opened branches directly in the communities where other banks are established, in fact, across the street 
from them because it is not only a question of getting new business, it's a question of servicing and retaining the accounts that 
we now have. . . . . . ""Q. And your business is not necessarily dependent upon it [the customer] being within a mile or two of a branch, is it? ""A. To a large degree, it is, because we found that we were losing deposit accounts regularly from our in-town offices because 
other banks were opening or had offices in other sections of the city; and in order to retain those accounts and to get additional 
business we felt it was necessary to establish branches."" (R. 1815.) As far as the customer for a bank loan is concerned, ""the size of his market is somewhat dependent upon his own size, how well 
he is known, and so on.  For example, for small business concerns known primarily locally, they may consider that their market 
is a strictly local one, and they may be forced by circumstances to do business with banks in a nearby geographic relationship to 
them.  On the other hand, as businesses increase in size, the scope of their business activities, their national reputation, the 
alternatives they have available to them will be spread again over a very large area, possibly as large as the entire United 
States."" (R. 1372.) (Defendants' testimony on direct examination.)"
343,36," The figures for PNB and Girard respectively are: 54% and 63% of the dollar volume of their commercial and industrial loans 
originate in the four-county area; 75% and 70%, personal loans; 74% and 84%, real estate loans; 41% and 62%, lines of credit; 
94% and 72%, personal trusts; 81% and 94%, time and savings deposits; 56% and 77%, demand deposits; 93% and 87%, 
demand deposits of individuals.  Actually, these figures may be too low.  The evidence discloses that most of the business done "
344,," outside the area is with large borrowers and large depositors; appellees do not, by and large, deal with small businessmen and 
average individuals not located in the four-county area.  For example, of appellees' combined total business demand deposits 
under $ 10,000, 94% originate in the four-county area.  This reinforces the thesis that the smaller the customer, the smaller is his 
banking market geographically.  See note 35, supra. The appellees concede that the four-county area has sufficient commercial importance to qualify, under Brown Shoe Co., supra, 
at 336-337, as a ""section of the country"" within the meaning of § 7.  See Maryland & Va. Milk Producers Assn. v.  United States, 
362 U.S. 458, 469; cf.   United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U.S. 218, 226; Indiana Farmer's Guide Publishing Co. v.  Prairie 
Farmer Publishing Co., 293 U.S. 268, 279."
344,37," Appellees suggest not that bank offices skirting the four-county area provide meaningful alternatives to bank customers within 
the area, but that such alternatives are provided by large banks, from New York and elsewhere, which solicit business in the 
Philadelphia area.  There is no evidence of the amount of business done in the area by banks with offices outside the area; it 
may be that such figures are unobtainable.  In any event, it would seem from the local orientation of banking insofar as smaller 
customers are concerned, see notes 35 and 36, supra, that competition from outside the area would only be important to the 
larger borrowers and depositors.  If so, the four-county area remains a valid geographical market in which to assess the 
anticompetitive effect of the proposed merger upon the banking facilities available to the smaller customer -- a perfectly good 
""line of commerce,"" in light of Congress' evident concern, in enacting the 1950 amendments to § 7, with preserving small 
business.  See Brown Shoe Co., supra, at 315-316.  As a practical matter the small businessman can only satisfy his credit 
needs at local banks.  To be sure, there is still some artificiality in deeming the four-county area the relevant ""section of the 
country"" so far as businessmen located near the perimeter are concerned.  But such fuzziness would seem inherent in any 
attempt to delineate the relevant geographical market.  Note,  52 Col. L. Rev. 766, 778-779, n. 77 (1952). And it is notable that 
outside the four-county area, appellees' business rapidly thins out.  Thus, the other six counties of the Delaware Valley account 
for only 2% of appellees' combined individual demand deposits; 4% demand deposits of partnerships and corporations; 7%, 
loans; 2%, savings deposits; 4%, business time deposits. "

345,40," See p. 331, supra.  We note three factors that cause us to shade the percentages given earlier in this opinion, in seeking to 
calculate market share.  (1) The percentages took no account of banks which do business in the four-county area but have no 
offices there; however, this seems to be a factor of little importance, at least insofar as smaller customers are concerned, see 
note 37, supra.  (2) The percentages took no account of banks which have offices in the four-county area but not their home 
offices there; however, there seem to be only two such offices and appellees in this Court make no reference to this omission.  
(3) There are no percentages for the amount of business of banks located in the area, other than appellees, which originates in 
the area.  Appellees contend that since most of the 40 other banks are smaller, they do a more concentratedly local business "
346,," than appellees, and hence account for a relatively larger proportion of such business.  If so, we doubt much correction is 
needed.  The five largest banks in the four-county area at present control some 78% of the area banks' assets.  Thus, even if the 
small banks have a somewhat different pattern of business, it is difficult to see how that would substantially diminish the 
appellees' share of the local banking business. No evidence was introduced as to the quantitative significance of these three factors, and appellees do not contend that as a 
practical matter such evidence could have been obtained.  Under the circumstances, we think a downward correction of the 
percentages to 30% produces a conservative estimate of appellees' market share."
346,41," Kaysen and Turner, supra, note 38, suggest that 20% should be the line of prima facie unlawfulness; Stigler suggests that any 
acquisition by a firm controlling 20% of the market after the merger is presumptively unlawful; Markham mentions 25%.  Bok's 
principal test is increase in market concentration, and he suggests a figure of 7% or 8%.  And consult note 20, supra.  We 
intimate no view on the validity of such tests for we have no need to consider percentages smaller than those in the case at bar, 
but we note that such tests are more rigorous than is required to dispose of the instant case.  Needless to say, the fact that a 
merger results in a less-than-30% market share, or in a less substantial increase in concentration than in the instant case, does 
not raise an inference that the merger is not violative of § 7.  See, e. g., Brown Shoe Co., supra."
346,42," See note 41, supra.  It is no answer that, among the three presently largest firms (First Pennsylvania, PNB, and Girard), there 
will be no increase in concentration. If this argument were valid, then once a market had become unduly concentrated, further 
concentration would be legally privileged.  On the contrary, if concentration is already great, the importance of preventing even 
slight increases in concentration and so preserving the possibility of eventual deconcentration is correspondingly great.  
Comment, note 39, supra, at 1644. "
347,43," The fact that some of the bank officers who testified represented small banks in competition with appellees does not 
substantially enhance the probative value of their testimony.  HN15[
] The test of a competitive market is not only whether 
small competitors flourish but also whether consumers are well served.  See  United States v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 168 
F.Supp. 576, 588, 592 (D. C. S. D. N. Y. 1958). ""Congressional concern [was] with the protection of competition, not 
competitors."" Brown Shoe Co., supra, at 320.  In an oligopolistic market, small companies may be perfectly content to follow the 
high prices set by the dominant firms, yet the market may be profoundly anticompetitive."
347,44," Entry is, of course, wholly a matter of governmental grace.  See p. 328, supra.  In the 10-year period ending in 1961, only one 
new bank opened in the Philadelphia four-county area.  That was in 1951.  At the end of 10 years, the new bank controlled only 
one-third of 1% of the area's deposits."
347,45," The following colloquy is representative: ""Q. Mr. Jennings, what is the nature of competition among commercial banks? ""A. Keen, highly competitive. I think, from my own observation, that I have never known competition among banks to be keener 
than it is today. . . . ""Q. In what area does competition exist? . . . ""A. I think the stiffest, sternest competition of all is in the field to obtain demand deposits and loans. . . . ""Q. What form does the competition take? ""A. It takes many forms.  If we are dealing with the deposits of large corporations, wealthy individuals, I would say that most, if 
not all, of the major banks of the country are competing for such deposits. The same would hold true as regards loans to those 
corporations or wealthy individuals. ""If we go into the field of smaller loans, smaller deposits, the competition is more regional -- wide but nevertheless regional -- 
and there the large banks as well as the small banks are after that business with everything they have. "
348,," . . . . ""Q. What form does the competition take?  Is it competition in price? ""A. No, I wouldn't say that it is competition as to price.  After all, interest rates are regulated at the top level by the laws of the 50 
states.  Interest rates at the bottom level have no legal limitation, but for practical purposes the prime rate . . . furnishes a very 
effective floor.  I would say that the area of competition for interest rates would range between, let us say, the prime rate of 4 1/2 
and 6 per cent for normal loans exclusive of consumer loans, where higher rates are permitted. . . . . ""In the area of service charges, I would say that banks are competitive in that field.  They base their service charges primarily on 
their costs, but they have to maintain a weather eye to windward as to what the competitors are charging in the service charge 
field.  The minute they get out of line in connection with service charges they find their customers will start to protest, and if 
something isn't done some of the customers will leave them for a differential in service charges of any significance. ""I do not believe that competition is really affected by the price area.  I think it is affected largely by the quality and the caliber of 
service that banks give and whether or not they feel they are being received in the right way, whether they are welcome in the 
bank.  Personalities enter into it very heavily, but I do not think price as such is a major factor in banking competition.  It is there, 
it is a factor, but not major."" (R. 1940-1942.) It should be noted that besides competition in interest rates, there is a great deal of indirect price competition in the banking 
industry. For example, the amount of compensating balance a bank requires of a borrower (i. e., the amount the borrower must 
always retain in his demand deposit account with the bank) affects the real cost of the loan, and varies considerably in the 
bank's discretion. "
349,46," Thus, arguably, the so-called failing-company defense, see International Shoe Co. v.  Federal Trade Comm'n, 280 U.S. 291, 
299-303, might have somewhat larger contours as applied to bank mergers because of the greater public impact of a bank 
failure compared with ordinary business failures.  But the question what defenses in § 7 actions must be allowed in order to avert 
unsound banking conditions is not before us, and we intimate no view upon it. "

and uncontrolled competition in the field of banking, and from insufficiently regulated competition. . . .  The rapid increase in the 
number of small weak banks, to such a large number that the Comptroller could not effectively supervise them or control any but 
the worst abuses, was one of the factors which led to the panic of 1907. ""The banking collapse in the early 1930's again was in large part the result of insufficient regulation and control of banks, in 
effect the result of too much competition."" See also 105 Cong. Rec. 8076 (1959): ""But unlimited and unrestricted competition in 
banking is just not possible.  We have had too many panics and banking crises and bank failures, largely as the result of 
excessive competition in banking, to consider for a moment going back to the days of free banking or unregulated banking."""

(c).  Compare § 6 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U. S. C. § 1816."
354,22," See also 106 Cong. Rec. 7259 (1960): ""The language of S. 1062 as amended by the House Banking and Currency Committee 
and as it appears in the bill we are now about to pass in the House makes it clear that the competitive and monopolistic factors 
are to be considered along with the banking factors and that after considering all of the factors involved, if the resulting institution 
will be in the public interest, then the application should be approved and otherwise disapproved."""
354,23," 106 Cong. Rec. 7257 (1960): ""This puts the responsibility for acting on a proposed merger where it belongs -- in the agency 
charged with supervising and examining the bank which will result from the merger. Out of their years of experience in 
supervising banks, our Federal banking agencies have developed specialized knowledge of banking and the people who engage 
in it.  They are experts at judging the condition of the banks involved, their prospects, their management, and the needs of the 
community for banking services.  They should have primary responsibility in deciding whether a proposed merger would be in 
the public interest."" (Emphasis added.)"
354,24," H. R. Rep. No. 1416, 86th Cong., 2d Sess. 11-12 (1960): ""We are convinced, also, that approval of a merger should depend 
on a positive showing of some benefit to be derived from it.  As previously indicated, your committee is not prepared to say that 
the cases enumerated in the hearings are the only instances in which a merger is in the public interest, nor are we prepared to 
devise a specific and exclusive list of situations in which a merger should be approved."""
354,25," Compare State Board of Ins. v.  Todd Shipyards Corp., 370 U.S. 451, 457, in which this Court refused to reconsider certain 
prior decisions because Congress had ""posited a regime of state regulation"" of the insurance business on their continuing 
validity.  Cf.   Toolson v. New York Yankees, Inc., 346 U.S. 356. "
355,26," If a bank merger such as this falls within the category of a ""stock"" acquisition, a § 7 suit to enjoin it may be brought not only by 
the Attorney General, but by the Federal Reserve Board as well.  See § 11 of the Clayton Act, 15 U. S. C. § 21 (vesting authority 
in the Board to enforce § 7 ""where applicable to banks"").  In an attempt to retain some semblance of the structure erected by 
Congress in the Bank Merger Act, the Court states that it ""supplanted . . . whatever authority the FRB may have acquired under 
§ 11, by virtue of the amendment of § 7, to enforce § 7 against bank mergers."" Ante, p. 344, note 22.  Since both the Attorney 
General and the Federal Reserve Board have purely advisory roles where a bank merger will result in a national bank, the 
Court's reasoning with respect to the effect of the Bank Merger Act upon enforcement authority should apply with equal force to 
both."
355,27," Indeed the Court has erected a simple yardstick in order to alleviate the agony of analyzing economic data -- control of 30% of 
a commercial banking market is prohibited.  Ante, pp. 363-364."
355,28," Although § 7 of the Clayton Act is applicable to an outright purchase of bank stock, this form of amalgamation is infrequently 
used in the banking field and does not involve divestiture problems of the same magnitude as does an asset acquisition."
355,29," It is true, as the Court points out (ante, p. 354), that Congress, in enacting the Bank Merger Act, agreed that the applicability of 
the Sherman Act to banking should not be disturbed.  See, e. g., 105 Cong. Rec. 8076 (1959).  But surely this alone provides no 
conceivable justification for applying the Clayton Act as well.  Apart from the fact that the Sherman Act covers many kinds of 
restraints besides mergers, one of the sponsors of the Bank Merger Act (Senator Fulbright) expressed his expectation that in a 
Sherman Act case a bank merger would not be subjected to strict antitrust standards to the exclusion of all other considerations: 
""And even if the Sherman Act is held to apply to banking and to bank mergers, it seems clear that under the rule of reason 
spelled out in the Standard Oil case, different considerations will be found applicable, in a regulated field like banking, in 
determining whether activities would 'unduly diminish competition,' in the words of the Supreme Court in that case."" 106 Cong. 
Rec. 9711 (1960).  Moreover, this Court has recognized in other areas that it may be necessary to accommodate the Sherman 
Act to regulatory policy.  McLean Trucking Co. v.  United States, 321 U.S. 67, 83;  Federal Communications Comm'n v. RCA 
Communications, Inc., 346 U.S. 86, 91-92. See also  United States v. Columbia Steel Co., 334 U.S. 495, 527. And of course the 
Sherman Act is concerned more with existing anticompetitive effects than with future probabilities, and thus would not reach 
incipient restraints to the same extent as would § 7 of the Clayton Act. See Brown Shoe Co. v.  United States, 370 U.S. 294, 
317-318 and notes 32, 33. "
356,30," In these respects a merger is precisely the contrary of what § 7 was originally designed to proscribe -- the secret acquisition of 
corporate control.  See the Court's opinion, ante, p. 338. "
357,31," That the stock-acquisition provision was not intended to cover mergers is strongly suggested by the second paragraph of § 7: 
""No corporation shall acquire . . . any part of the stock . . . of one or more corporations . . . where . . . the effect . . . of the use of 
such stock by the voting or granting of proxies . . . may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly."" 
15 U. S. C. § 18. (Emphasis added.) After a merger has been consummated, the resulting corporation holds no stock in any 
party to the merger; thus there can be in this situation no such thing as a restraint of trade by ""the use"" of the voting power of 
acquired stock."
357,32," On this point, the dissenters agreed: ""It is true that the Clayton Act does not forbid corporate mergers . . . .""  291 U.S., at 600.

the Judiciary, 81st Cong., 1st & 2d Sess. 109-110 (1950): ""The loophole sought to be filled resulted from a series of Supreme 
Court decisions.  (Swift & Co. v. FTC and Thatcher Mfg. Co. v.  FTC (272 U.S. 554); Arrow-Hart & Hegeman Co. v.  FTC (291 
U.S. 587).) In these decisions the Supreme Court held that section 7 of the Clayton Act, while prohibiting the acquisition of stock 
of a competitor, gave the Federal Trade Commission no authority under section 11 to order divestiture of assets which had been 
acquired before a cease-and-desist order was issued, even though the acquisition resulted from the voting of illegally held 
stock."""

the legal distinction, between a merger and a stock acquisition. Thus at the end of the paragraph quoted by the Court the 
Senator stated: "". . . I cannot see how on earth you can get the idea that the purchase of the stock of the corporation, all of it, 
does not carry with it the transfer of all of the physical assets in that corporation."" Hearings on H. R. 2734 before a

391,9," These prices were higher than those admittedly charged by the licensees for the two brands to the persons and at the times 
charged by the accusation."
391,10," The record discloses that these exhibits were only received for identification and that the specific objections thereto were 
never formally ruled upon.  No error is assigned by the licensees in respect to such omission.  The specific objections interposed 
upon the presentation of these exhibits were substantially the same as those specified in the notice of defense which the hearing 
officer overruled.  It is also apparent from the hearing officer's proposed decision that the finding against the licensees on the 
issue to which these exhibits were directed was in effect a ruling overruling the objection.  (See Van Haaren v. Whitmore, 2 
Cal.App.2d 632, 634 [38 P.2d 829]; Citizens' Bank of Los Angeles v. Jones, 121 Cal. 30, 33 [53 P. 354].) Moreover, both parties 
throughout the proceedings below and on this appeal have considered and treated these exhibits as having been admitted into 
evidence.  It is well established that HN6[
] where the record shows that a document has been considered by the court and the 
parties as being in evidence, a reviewing court will not look for technical reasons to exclude from consideration any part of the 
record which was before the court below.  ( Mann v. Mann, 76 Cal.App.2d 32, 41-42 [172 P.2d 369]; Estate of Pailhe, 114 
Cal.App.2d 658, 664 [251 P.2d 76]; Reed v. Reed, 128 Cal.App.2d 786, 790-791 [276 P.2d 36]; see also Miller v. Peters, 37

Cal.App.2d 1, 5 [317 P.2d 104], to the effect that HN7[
] where parties proceed throughout the trial upon a theory that a certain 
issue is presented for adjudication both parties are thereafter estopped from thereafter claiming that no such issue was in 
controversy.) Furthermore, it should be noted that at the conclusion of the hearing counsel for licensees conceded that there 
were no factual disparities involved and that the parties were ""generally agreed on the factual basis.  . . ."""
391,11," As indicated by this affidavit The Beverage Industry News-Section No. 2 is an industry price list or book printed and published 
monthly in the State of California. "
393,12," Except for licensees involved, the brands of the alcoholic beverages entailed in the accusation, the dates of sale, the prices 
charged, and the persons to whom sold, the essential facts are almost identical.  In DeMartini the accusation contained nine 
counts.  The first seven counts involved alleged fair trade violation and the last two counts charged the sale and delivery of the 
beverages designated in the said first seven counts without accompanying delivery orders and the keeping on file copies 
thereof.  The subject matter of the last two counts is not involved in the instant case.  The only other significant point of 
distinction does not go to the facts but to disposition of the matter by the trial court.  In DeMartini the trial court ordered the 
issuance of a peremptory writ commanding the Department to vacate and set aside its decision that the license of the licensees 
be suspended, and the appeal from such judgment was by the Department.  (There was also a cross-appeal by the licensees 
from that part of the judgment which commanded the Department to take such further steps in the proceedings against them as 
were not inconsistent with the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law.)"

429,7," .  In its argument before this court, Sinclair goes even further than the District Court, and insists that a refusal to deal, even if in

430,9," .  The loss sustained during the life of the unlawful agreement is in this case, as it could well be in others, purely incidental; the 
chief injury is occasioned by the termination of business relations, which Sinclair brought about in furtherance of the unlawful tie-
in arrangement.  Indeed, in many cases the only possible injury stems from an unlawful refusal to deal, where there has been no 
prior experience whatever of business transactions between the parties."
430,10," .  The Loew's case is very much in point here, for it involved tying arrangements concededly without any monopolization or 
conspiracy. The Court there held that several distributors of films for television were guilty of unlawful tying arrangements when 
they conditioned the sale of certain desirable films upon the purchase of others less desirable.  The Court pointed out, 371 U.S 
at p. 40, 83 S.Ct. at pp. 99-100, 9 L.Ed.2d 11: 'No combination or conspiracy among the distributors was alleged; nor was any monopolization or attempt to monopolize under 
§ 2 of the Sherman Act averred.  The sole claim of illegality rested on the manner in which each defendant had marketed its 
product.  The successful pressure applied to television station customers to accept inferior films along with desirable pictures 
was the gravamen of the complaint.' The decree in Loew's limited the distributors' right to refuse to deal to situations not involving unlawful tying arrangements."

431,12," .  The right of customer selection sanctioned by Colgate must not, as Parke, Davis shows, be taken in its literal generality.  The 
appellee bases too much on Colgate, without taking into account qualifying pronouncements in later decisions, which are not 
less canonical. Illustrating just how limited is the permissible refusal to deal where the seller's policies are designed to restrain trade, the Second 
Circuit recently said, George W. Warner & Co. v. Black & Decker Mfg. Co., 277 F.2d 787, 790 (2d Cir. 1960): 'The Supreme 
Court has left a narrow channel through which a manufacturer may pass even though the facts would have to be of such Doric 
simplicity as to be somewhat rare in this day of complex business enterprises.'"
431,13," .  In Schrader's, supra, at pp. 99-100, 40 S.Ct. at p. 253, 64 L.Ed. 471, the Court made it clear that when a seller, through a 
course of dealing undertakes to bind his customers to a policy in restraint of trade, he has put together a combination or 
arrangement in violation of law: 'It seems unnecessary to dwell upon the obvious difference between the situation presented when a manufacturer merely 
indicates his wishes concerning prices and declines further dealings with all who fail to observe them, and one where he enters 
into agreements --  whether express or implied from a course of dealing or other circumstances --  with all customers throughout 
the different States which undertake to bind them to observe fixed resale prices.  In the first, the manufacturer but exercises his 
independent discretion concerning his customers and there is no contract or combination which imposes any limitation on the 
purchaser.  In the second, the parties are combined through agreements designed to take away dealers' control of their own 
affairs and thereby destroy competition and restrain the free and natural flow of trade amongst the States.' It is clear from the Schrader's, Englander, and Warner cases, as well as many others, that if the seller imposes a trade 
restraining arrangement upon his customers, whether they be willing or reluctant, the seller has acted outside the protection of 
Colgate. Contrary to the theory adopted in the instant case, there need not be a concert of action among several sellers, or a "
432,," conspiracy between the seller and customers who actively assist the seller in securing adherence to his policy of suppressing 
competition.  If the arrangement or combination between the seller and his dealers is put together through the coercive tactics of 
the seller alone, this is sufficient."
432,14," .  See, e.g., House of Materials, Inc. v. Simplicity Pattern Co., 298 F.2d 867 (2d Cir. 1962), where the refusal to deal was not in

had instituted a suit against the seller."

433,17," .  Nor would it be a defense to Sinclair that it had a contractual right, under the written lease and written sales agreement, to 
terminate the relationship on May 31, 1956.  A refusal to deal based upon a contract provision is, in respect to the antitrust laws, 
no different from the right of traders generally to select their customers. In either case, the right is limited to situations where the 
seller has not put together an arrangement in restraint of trade. As the Sixth Circuit has pointed out, Englander Motors, Inc. v. 
Ford Motor Company, 267 F.2d 11, 15 (1959): 'There is nothing intrinsically wrong with a short notice cancellation provision unless by its exercise Ford was able to coerce 
violations, and by its use had forced Englander to sell its business. * * * (But) the use of a short term cancellation provision for 
the purpose of violating the law is itself a violation of the anti-trust law.' See also, Vines v. General Outdoor Advertising Co., 171 F.2d 487, 491 (2d Cir. 1948), where the court, by Judge Learned Hand, 
pointed out with his customary clarity that in spite of a contractual provision reserving to the seller the right not to deal, the buyer 
could recover for a refusal to deal in furtherance of an antitrust violation, as the contractual provision 'gave the defendant no 
more immunity from that tort than from any other tort.'"
433,18," .  We have summarized the facts here as they were found by the District Court in the original trial and as set forth in detail in 
our first opinion, without undertaking to answer contrary inferences treated as facts in the dissent. Nor have we undertaken to answer points in the dissent which represent a view of the law rejected in the first opinion of this 
court and at variance even with Sinclair's contentions on this appeal.  Sinclair does not on this appeal dispute our prior holding 
that thee existed an unlawful arrangement whereby the sale of TBA was tied both to the sale of gasoline and to the lease of the 
station and that it refused to deal with Osborn partly because he did not abide by this arrangement.  Sinclair frankly 
acknowledges this to be a case of refusal to deal but seeks to justify its conduct on the Colgate doctrine.  This contention has 
been answered in the foregoing paragraphs and we deem it unnecessary to answer other contentions advanced in the 
dissenting opinion going beyond those raised by the parties."

434,3," .  It is important to remember that the District Court found, with abundant support, that Sinclair had no monopoly power, 
engaged in no conspiracy or attempt to monopolize, and did nothing to unreasonably restrain trade in any product."
434,4," .  During the Sherwood era, Sherwood did not purchase tires, tubes or batteries, but received commissions on purchase orders 
for those goods, routed through it by its dealers, as Sinclair did on other accessories.  Sherwood passed from the picture in 
1955, however, and the governing Goodyear agreements at the time of the cancellation were Sinclair's, not Sherwood's."
434,5," .  Actually Sherwood, Sinclair's predecessor, but, for convenience, we refer to Sinclair whether the immediate actor was Sinclair 
or its predecessor-subsidiary, Sherwood. "
435,6," .  There is no suggestion that Firestone enjoys any such public acceptance over Goodyear that, if a choice were given each 
customer, any such ratio of sales could have resulted. "
436,7," .   Standard Oil Company of California v. United States, 337 U.S. 293, 305, 69 S.Ct. 1051, 93 L.Ed. 1371. L.Ed. 1371. "
437,8," .  That agreement was to carry both Goodyear and Firestone TBA and let each customer choose between the two. A reader of the opinion on the first appeal may find in it more than I indicate.  Many conferences and a voluminous 
correspondence among the members of the panel which heard the first appeal influence my understanding of what was intended 
to be decided on the first appeal.  All of that may now be irrelevant, and I accept the result of the first appeal.  The present issue 
of Sinclair's liability for damages flowing from the lease cancellation, however, involves more than the quantum of the damages.  
Resolution of the substantive issue should be governed by the facts as they appear in the record, and our view of them need not 
be limited by what was said or not said in the first opinion.  In dealing with them and their legal consequences, as I see them, I 
have not felt required to conform my statement of the record facts and of my present views to everything that was said in all of its 
possible implications in the first opinion.  Indeed, with the same case now before us again, we are free to modify in any 
appropriate way anything said in the first opinion. "
442,1," In response to inquiry by the Court, Ethyl, by its attorneys, while protesting the necessity of doing so, admitted that 'Ethyl's 
current manufacturing operations for the production of aluminum trialkyls do embody a process covered by one or more claims 
of Ziegler's Patent No.  3,032,574.' See Exhibit 71. "
444,2," This would be especially true in the case of a patentee who, like Ziegler, owns a patent on the only process by which a certain 
product may be produced commercially. "
446,1," 'Ziegler cannot do what he attempted, not because the public interest philosophy of the patent or antitrust laws forbids it, but 
solely because the patent laws encompass only that which is set forth in the patent claims. Absent a product claim no product 
monopoly exists. Any control over the unpatented product exists merely as a by-product of a process patent. It is not within the 
protection of the patent monopoly and thus not a property right subject to grant.' See court's previous opinion in this case filed 
Dec. 5, 1963, p. 458."
446,2, All of the defendants will hereafter be referred to collectively as 'Hercules'. Their relationship is set forth in the prior opinion.

of price should be an acceptable result of the Act's operation only if: (1) the language of the statute requires it, (2) it is necessary 
to facilitate competition of some kind elsewhere, and (3) its scope is strictly limited to the need for it."

479,1," .  4 of the Clayton Act has been codified as 15 U.S.C. 15. A 'historical note' appended to this section in the United States Code 
explains that 15 U.S.C. 15 'applies to the provisions of this chapter generally and supersedes' 7 of the Sherman Act which was 
'restricted in operation to the particular act cited.' Both before and after the formal repeal of 7 in 1955, litigants and courts alike 
would often cite this historical note, ' 15 U.S.C. 15 note,' as the statutory foundation for treble-damage actions instituted for 
substantive Sherman Act violations.  See, e.g., Boro Hall Corp. v. General Motors Corp., 124 F.2d 822 (2d Cir. 1942), cert. den., 
317 U.S. 695, 63 S.Ct. 436, 87 L.Ed. 556 (1942); Tobman v. Cottage Woodcraft Shop, 194 F.Supp. 83 (S.D.Cal.1961). We 
interpret this practice as resting on an assumption that the treble damage provision of 4 had, in effect, become part of the 
Sherman Act. While this in itself would be a sufficient answer to appellee's contentions, we prefer to rest our decision on the 
clearly expressed intention of Congress, to be discussed, infra. "
481,2," .  It has been argued that the government would still be free to impose civil and criminal sanctions for 3(b) violations, but we find 
this insufficient.  As the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has said, the 'broad scope of the antitrust laws, was part of the 
legislative scheme 'intended in the most comprehensive way to provide against combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade 
or commerce'. * * * The Clayton Act was part of the overall plan and the 'right of the injured party to recover damages was 
intended to provoke greater respect for the Act.' * * * 'The treble-damage action was intended not merely to redress injury to an 
individual through the prohibited practices, but to aid in achieving the broad social object of the statute."" Karseal Corp. v.

deal prohibited by § 3 of the Clayton Act (see note 38) does not exist when, as in the present case, the refusal to deal is part of a 
course of conduct violative of § 1 of the Sherman Act. A. C. Becken Co. v. Gemex Corp., 272 F.2d 1 (7th Cir. 1959); Halper,

492,8," .  The instruction requested read: 'A plaintiff whose lease and product agreements have been cancelled as a result of conduct in violation of the antitrust laws is 
entitled to be awarded as damages the loss of profits and values resulting from the cancellations. 'If you find that Paul Lessig had developed net income and profits at the service station at 22nd and Irving Street, San Francisco 
during the period May, 1955, to May 15, 1958, and there was reasonable likelihood that such net earnings and profits would 
have continued in the future you may award as damages the value of such future profits as of the date of cancellation.' Lessig 
also objected to the omission of three other instructions on damages. One was simply a generalized restatement of the 
instruction quoted; two were sufficiently covered by instructions which were given."
492,9, .  See note 7.
492,10," .  Tidewater argues that the omission of the requested instruction was unimportant since the jury was given general instructions 
that 'the purpose of the law of damages is to place a party in as good a position as he would have enjoyed but for the wrong 
done,' and the calculation 'should include all damages suffered by the plaintiff because of lost profits'; and because the jury was 
told that it might base its award on the testimony of the expert witnesses, which related in part to loss suffered as a result of the 
cancellation. But these generalizations and possible inferences were not the fair equivalent of the specific instruction to which 
Lessig was entitled. "

493,12," .  Similarly, Tidewater did not concede that, as a condition to 'dealer-aid,' it required its dealers to post signs showing a 
specified retail price. Tidewater officials testified that price signs were furnished to dealers only as a convenience to assist them 
in complying with California law governing the size, content, form, and color of gasoline price signs (see note 15), and that they 
were given whatever numbers they wished to post."

494,15," .  Some of the instructions given by the trial court to which this comment will apply, if they are repeated at the new trial, are the 
following: that it was lawful for Tidewater to sell gasoline to its dealers at any price it thought proper; that Tidewater was under 
no legal obligation to enable its dealers to make a large, small, or any, profit; and that it was lawful for Tidewater to reduce its 
price to its dealers whenever it thought necessary or advisable. A somewhat related problem is raised by the reading to the jury of the full text of Cal.Bus. & Prof.Code, §§ 20880, 20882, 
20882.5, 20883, 20887, and 20888, pertaining to the display by service stations of signs showing retail gasoline prices.  It seems 
to us that an epitomization of the statutory provisions with an explanation of their limited relevance to the issues would be better 
calculated to clarify the issues in the minds of the jurors."

(1962), the usual tying contract is 'inherently anticompetitive' because it 'forces the customer to take a product or brand he does 
not necessarily want,' whereas requirements contracts 'are frequently negotiated at the behest of the customer who has chosen 
the particular supplier and his product upon the basis of competitive merit.' Evidence in the present case that exclusive dealing 
was imposed against the dealers' will, and that if free to choose dealers would have bought competitive products, lends support 
to the conclusion that these arrangements were substantially anticompetitive in effect, unlike requirements contracts which the 
buyer is free to accept or reject. Moreover, in evaluating the impact on competition, exclusive dealing arrangements imposed in a context of coercion should be 
treated as indefinite in duration.  Bok, The Tampa Electric Case and the Problem of Exclusive Arrangements under the Clayton 
Act, The Supreme Court Review 267, 313-14 n. 119 (1961)."
496,23," .  The number of stations and volume of trade affected were somewhat greater in Standard than in the present case, and there 
was an explicit showing in Standard, but not in this case, that other major oil companies in the market were also operating under 
exclusive dealing arrangements.  However, judging from the district court opinion in Richfield, these factual disparities, as well as 
those previously mentioned, likewise existed between that case and Standard, and the Supreme Court affirmed Richfield on the 
ground that the issues raised were 'substantially the same as those decided in Standard * * *.' 343 U.S. 922, 72 S.Ct. 665, 96

applicability of the Sherman Act must be considered because § 3 of the Clayton Act applies only to the lease or sale 'of goods, 
wares, merchandise, machinery, * * * or other commodities,' and therefore would not be violated if the jury concluded that 
Tidewater tied TBA only to the leasing of service stations, and not to the sale of petroleum products.  See Northern Pac. Ry. v.

497,27," .  There was testimony that it cost a dealer as much as $ 5,000 to take over a station pumping 12,000 gallons of gasoline a 
month, although, of course, a portion of this initial expense would be recovered.  And, as Tidewater itself points out, under 
California law (Cal.Bus. & Prof.Code, §§ 20840, 20849-20851), 'in order lawfully to handle gasoline acquired from others, Lessig 
would either have had to install a separate set of tanks and pumps or to relabel those already at the station.' Tidewater urges 
this as the real reason Lessig bought gasoline only from Tidewater. Compare Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 337-338 n. 66, 82 S.Ct. 1502, 1530-1531, 8 L.Ed.2d 510 (1962), 
where, in another context, the Court said: 'Since the retailer was required, under this plan, to invest his own resources and 
develop his good will to a substantial extent in the sale of Brown products, the flow of which Brown could readily terminate, 
Brown was able to exercise sufficient control over these stores and departments to warrant their characterization as 'Brown' 
outlets * * *.'"

A' batteries, and the record disclosed that Lessig purchased 31 of the latter during 1956."
498,34," .  Lessig contended that the contract required dealers to purchase their full requirements of petroleum products from Tidewater.  
Tidewater argued that the language meant only that dealers were to buy their full requirements of Tidewater trademarked 
products directly from Tidewater, and that they were free to buy products produced by others whenever and from whatever 
source they wished. "
499,35," .  The statement in the instructions that Lessig must have 'committed himself in advance' to buy sponsored TBA items only 
from Tidewater should be avoided.  Although it may mean in advance of purchase, as Tidewater suggests, as Lessig suggests it 
may also be taken to mean that the condition or understanding must exist at the outset of the relationship between buyer and 
seller, thus precluding a finding of tacit condition or understanding based on a subsequent course of conduct."

complainants who have paid this freight rate have not actually been injured. * * * Such is not, in our opinion, the proper meaning 
of this term.  These complainants were * * * entitled to a reasonable rate from the defendants for the service of transportation.  
An unreasonable rate was in fact exacted. They were thereby deprived of a legal right and the measure of their damage is the 
difference between the rate to which they were entitled and the rate which they were compelled to pay.  If complainants were 
obliged to follow every transaction to its ultimate result and to trace out the exact commercial effect of the freight rate paid, it 
would never be possible to show damages with sufficient accuracy to justify them. Certainly these defendants are not entitled to 
this money which they have taken from the complainants, and they ought not to be heard to say that they should not be required 
to refund this amount because the complainants themselves may have obtained some portion of this sum from the consumer. * *

522,1," Organized in December 1960 -- the new local division of the American Osteopathic Association, which division succeeded the 
California Osteopathic Association as such local division when it allegedly was expelled by the American Osteopathic 
Association for entering into the merger agreement. "
526,2," The merger agreement (omitting the schedules and signatures) is as follows: ""This Agreement is made and entered into this -- day of May, 1961, by and between the California Medical Association, an 
unincorporated association, hereinafter sometimes called the 'CMA' and the California Osteopathic Association, a California 
corporation, hereinafter sometimes called the 'COA,' to be effective at the time, and upon the terms and conditions as hereinafter 
set forth below. ""A.  General."
526,1," . Purposes.  This agreement is made and entered into for the primary purposes of improving the health services available to the 
citizens of the State of California, and expanding medical teaching facilities in the State.  The 'Governor's Committee on the 
Study of Medical Aid and Health' has urged immediate expansion of 'medical educational capacity in private and public 
institutions' and the establishment of new medical schools.  These purposes are to be further accomplished by the unification, "
527,," consonant with the desires of individual practicing physicians within the State of California, of the separate organizations which 
have heretofore existed in parallel structure in the State of California for the practice of medicine and surgery by persons who 
hold the degree of Doctor of Osteopathy and those who hold the degree of Doctor of Medicine. By accomplishing such 
unification, the parties hereto intend to remove any distinction among the individuals practicing medicine and surgery that is not 
related to skill and ability, to make available to the public at large efficient and adequate hospital facilities, and to improve the 
educational facilities available for those persons engaged in the practice of medicine and surgery.  It is also a primary purpose of 
the parties hereto that upon the students at the present College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons in Los Angeles or its 
successor becoming eligible to be licensed by the State Board of Medical Examiners, no new or additional physician and 
surgeon's certificates shall thereafter be issued by the State Board of Osteopathic Examiners, whether applied for under Articles 
5, 6 or 11 of Chapter 5, Division 2, of the California Business and Professions Code.  It is not the purpose of any party to this 
agreement to alter or diminish in any way the practice rights of individual physicians, or to limit their opportunity of future 
practice. ""2. Execution and effective date.  Upon approval of this agreement by the governing boards of the respective parties hereto, this 
agreement shall be executed by the Chairman of such board and its Secretary.  Said signatures shall indicate the approval of 
that board only. ""This agreement shall become binding and effective when it has been ratified by the House of Delegates of each of the parties 
hereto, in accordance with the appropriate rules and regulations of each respective organization. ""The parties hereto recognize and acknowledge that the consummation of this agreement will require certain amendments to be 
made to the constitution of the CMA, and that the constitution requires that a proposed amendment, after introduction, lay on the 
table for a period of one year prior to its final adoption and effectiveness.  This agreement, however, shall become effective upon 
its initial ratification by both houses as above set forth, subject only to the conditions hereinafter set forth. ""3. Reference to COA.  As hereinafter provided, the COA agrees to change its name, and may in the course of the transition 
period change its organic structure.  References to COA shall thus include such organization, although its name shall be 
changed, and its organic structure may be changed. ""B.  Matters Related to the Structure of California Medical Association. ""1. Amendments to Constitution and By-Laws.  The Council of the CMA shall propose to its House of Delegates two 
amendments to the constitution, and one amendment to the by-laws of the CMA, as set forth on Exhibits A, B, and C, 
respectively, attached hereto and made a part hereof by reference. ""The House of Delegates of the CMA shall, as a condition precedent to the effectiveness of this contract, approve and adopt said 
amendments. ""2. Issuance of new charter to component society.  Upon said amendments becoming finally effective, the COA agrees (a) to 
change its name to the Forty-First Medical Society or such other name as may be jointly approved by the Board of Trustees of 
the COA and the Executive Secretary of CMA, and thereafter, (b) to apply for a charter as a component society of the CMA.  The 
CMA agrees to issue such charter. The terms and conditions of the charter to be applied for, and to be issued, shall be as set 
forth on Schedule D attached hereto, and made a part hereof by reference. ""3. Dissolution of COA.  The parties hereto acknowledge that the structure herein agreed upon for the issuance of a charter to a 
statewide organization under such new name is intended only as an interim measure.  It is the intention of both parties hereto 
that all persons who are members of such society shall become members of their respective county medical societies as soon 
as possible.  However, such arrangement requires the consent of each of the respective county medical societies.  When the 
county medical societies ""throughout the State of California agree to take into membership in the respective appropriate county 
medical society each of the members of such society, it shall be dissolved.  Upon such dissolution, all of the assets then 
remaining of such society shall, so far as is legally possible, be transferred and conveyed to the College of Osteopathic 
Physicians and Surgeons, or its successor. ""C.  Practice of Medicine and Use of Degree. ""The parties hereto contemplate that individual members of the COA who hold physicians and surgeons certificates in the State 
of California will obtain a degree of Doctor of Medicine from the College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons or its 
successor. The CMA agrees to accept such procedures which may be agreed upon by the Advisory Educational Committee, 
created by the joint action of the parties hereto, as to the manner in which said degrees shall be granted, provided, however, that "
528,," the agreed procedures do not jeopardize accreditation of the College.  Both parties hereto agree to recognize such degrees as 
an M.D. degree issued by an accredited medical school. ""D.  Statutory Amendments. ""1. Use of Degree.  Both parties hereto agree to use their best efforts to have adopted by the legislature of the State of California 
statutory amendments as set forth in Exhibit E attached hereto and made a part hereof by reference.  The parties hereto 
contemplate that where persons hold a degree of Doctor of Medicine and a degree of Doctor of Osteopathy, such person shall 
be required to elect to practice under one or the other of such degrees, and to advise both the Board of Medical Examiners and 
the Board of Osteopathic Examiners of such election. ""2 Boards of Examiners.  Both parties agree to use their best efforts to have adopted by the California Legislature the statutory 
amendments relating to the structure of the Board of Medical Examiners of the State of California and regarding the reciprocity 
statutes affecting such board, as set forth on Schedule F, attached hereto and made a part hereof. ""3. Initiative Act.  Both parties hereto agree to use their best efforts to have adopted by the legislature and by the people of the 
State of California, the proposal set forth on Exhibit G attached hereto and made a part hereof, regarding the initiative act 
establishing the Board of Osteopathic Examiners. ""E.  College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons. ""1. Agreement with College.  The COA agrees to negotiate a contract with the College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons 
covering the matters hereinafter set forth. In the event that the COA is unable to enter into such an agreement, the CMA shall 
have its option to declare this contract entirely null and void.  Said contract shall contain: ""(a) A procedure for the issuance of degree of Doctor of Medicine to doctors of Osteopathy presently licensed as physicians and 
surgeons in the State of California. ""(b) An agreement that said College shall use its best efforts to obtain approval by the Council on Medical Education and 
Hospitals and membership in the Association of American Medical Colleges. ""(c) The name of the College shall be changed, so that neither the word 'osteopathic' nor any similar word shall be used therein. ""2. Agreements relating to College. ""(a) The parties hereto shall jointly use their best efforts to secure appropriate administrative rules or statutory changes to permit 
students currently enrolled in the College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons to be eligible for examination by the licensing 
board of their choice: and ""(b) The parties hereto shall agree with each other, and with the College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons as follows: ""(i) The COA shall continue to contribute to the College fund for its operation at the rate of a minimum of $ 225,000.00 per year 
until one year from the time all conditions set forth in this agreement are met.  Thereafter, for an additional four years, COA and 
its successor shall allocate to the College at least Fifty Dollars ($ 50.00) per regular member per year, payable from the annual 
dues it charges its members (not including therein dues it pays to the CMA and the American Medical Association). ""'Regular member' shall not include persons granted reduced rate of dues for any reason.  The CMA and the COA shall jointly 
guarantee to the College that it shall receive funds in at least said amount of $ 225,000.00 per year payable quarterly from the 
sources herein indicated for an additional period of four years thereafter.  As between the CMA and the COA, the CMA will 
agree to supply said funds to said amount during said four year period to the extent that the COA or its successor does not do 
so.  The funds to be supplied under this paragraph may come from said organization ""directly, or may come from contributions 
from public or private sources, from funds or foundations, or otherwise, so long as they are arranged directly by the persons 
associated with and acting for the COA or the CMA. ""(ii) In the event that adequate arrangements for the financing of the College have not been concluded after said period, the 
COA and the CMA jointly declare their intention of seeing that the College has adequate operating funds to make up for the loss 
of funds which otherwise might have been paid by the COA had this agreement not been entered into.  However, this expression 
of intention is made without binding obligation on the parties hereto at this time. ""(c) Accreditation.  Both parties hereto shall use their best efforts to see that the College of Osteopathic Physicians and 
Surgeons, or its successor, is accredited as a medical school as soon as possible. "
529,," ""F.  Practice Rights. ""1. General.  As hereinabove set forth, both parties hereto acknowledge and declare that this agreement is not intended in any 
way to limit the practice rights of individual physicians. ""2. Hospitals.  The parties hereto shall join in a joint statement of policy with respect to practice rights and hospital privileges of 
physicians, to be forwarded to all hospitals in the State of California.  A copy of such joint declaration is attached hereto marked 
'Exhibit H' and made a part hereof by reference. ""3. Specialty Rights.  The parties hereto shall issue a joint declaration with respect to the specialty privileges of individual 
physicians, a copy of which joint statement is attached hereto marked 'Exhibit I' and made a part hereof by reference.  A copy of 
such declaration shall be forwarded to all hospitals, and to all physicians and surgeons in the State of California. ""4. Removal of Distinctions.  Both parties hereto shall use their best efforts, on a continuing basis, to remove any distinction 
between or among persons holding a certificate as physician and surgeon in the State of California and a degree of Doctor of 
Medicine, where such distinction is based solely upon the ground that any such person previously held or now holds a degree of 
Doctor of Osteopathy. ""5. Evaluation Groups.  The CMA agrees that the COA may continue for the purpose of serving its own members, such specialty 
and other evaluation groups as may have been established by it on or before April 1, 1961, and whose criteria shall be not less 
than those shown in a separate document entitled: 'Criteria of Evaluation Groups, California Osteopathic Association' heretofore 
delivered to the CMA by the COA.  All records of such evaluation and specialty groups shall be made available to the 
Commission on Medical Education of the CMA for examination and review. ""G.  Time Schedule and Conditions. ""1. Conditions Precedent.  As hereinabove set forth, this agreement shall become effective upon ratification by the House of 
Delegates of both of the parties hereto.  However, this agreement shall have no force or effect of any kind, unless the following 
conditions are met within the time periods hereinafter set forth. ""(a) Final adoption of constitutional amendments.  The final adoption of the constitutional amendment set forth on Exhibits A and 
B attached hereto shall take place on or before May 15, 1962. ""(b) Approval of College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons.  The College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons or its 
successor shall be approved by the State Board of Medical Examiners on or before May 15, 1962. ""(c) Hospitals.  On or before May 15, 1962, assurance from the Joint Commission on Accreditation as follows: ""(i) That hospitals presently approved by the COA Committee on Hospitals will be evaluated by them upon application. ""(ii) That Doctors of Osteopathy who have received a degree of Doctor of Medicine from the College of Osteopathic Physicians 
and Surgeons, or its successor under the procedure to be determined upon, will be recognized as persons holding degrees of 
Doctor of Medicine from an approved medical school for all purposes connected with the approval of hospitals. ""In the event that any of said conditions have not been met by the time herein set forth, the COA shall have the option of waiving 
such condition and continuing this agreement in effect, or of terminating this agreement and declaring it to be entirely void and of 
no effect. ""When all of such conditions have been either met, or waived by the COA, whether before or at the time limit set forth herein, 
each party shall immediately undertake performance of all things to be performed by it herein. ""5. Time table.  The parties shall immediately begin their efforts to have those legislative amendments set forth on Schedule E 
adopted and approved. ""The parties shall attempt to have those legislative and initiative measures approved as set forth on Schedules F and G as soon 
as all of the conditions precedent in this agreement have been met.  The parties contemplate that such conditions shall all be 
met on or before May 15, 1962. ""H.  Miscellaneous. "
530,," ""1. Phraseology.  The phraseology included herein in connection with the proposed amendments to the constitution and by-laws 
of the CMA, proposed statutory enactments and initiative enactment, is used for the purpose of setting forth the general intention 
of the parties hereto, and a change in the terminology used shall not be deemed to alter the effect or interfere with the 
performance of this agreement in any way, so long as it accomplishes the underlying intention of the respective provisions 
involved. ""2. Further documents and acts.  Each party hereto agrees to execute such other documents and agreements, and to undertake 
such other steps as may be necessary, in good faith, to carry out the underlying purpose of this agreement. ""In Witness Whereof, the parties hereto have executed this agreement the day and year first written above, and ratify it as 
hereinafter set forth. ""The Agreement Is Hereby Approved by the respective governing boards, subject to ratification as hereinabove set forth. [SEE ILLUSTRATION IN ORIGINAL] The within agreement has been ratified by the respective Houses of Delegates, on the dates indicated below: [SEE ILLUSTRATION IN ORIGINAL] "
538,1," .  See Vestal, The Constitution and Preclusion/Res Judicata, 62 Mich.L.Rev. 33. As pointed out in Lawlor v. National Screen 
Service Corp., 349 U.S. 322, 326, 75 S.Ct. 865, 99 L.Ed. 1122, (including n. 6) the term of res judicata is frequently broadly used 
to cover merger, bar, collateral estoppel, and direct estoppel.  Here, as in Lawlor, collateral estoppel is not applicable as the 
case was never tried and hence no findings of fact were made which the parties are precluded from challenging. "
541,2," .  Although the trial court refers to the fact that the prior adjudications were made in the federal court, the emphasis below was 
placed upon the observation that Freeman v. Bee Machine Co., 319 U.S. 448, 63 S.Ct. 1146, 87 L.Ed. 1509, would have 
permitted plaintiff to amend his pleadings upon removal in order to allege the federal anti-trust statutes.  The trial court points out 
that claim preclusion applies not only to that which is actually presented but also to that which might have been presented to 
support the claim.  214 F.Supp. 195, 197. Certainly Freeman holds that the federal statutes were available upon removal. 
However, Freeman should not be urged as authority for the position that since plaintiff could amend, we have one cause of 
action. Freeman speaks in permissive terms, and if the federal statute created a new and separate cause of action, plaintiff 
would not be compelled to amend upon removal in order to prevent preclusion of his remedy.  Our decision is based upon our 
determination that the cause of action stated in the present complaint is the same as that stated in the prior complaints. "
546,1," .   Highland Supply Corp. v. Reynolds Metals Co., 221 F.Supp. 15 (E.D.Mo.)."
546,2," .  Since the decision in Radiant Burners, Inc. v. Peoples Gas, etc., Co., 364 U.S. 656, 660, 81 S.Ct. 365, 5 L.Ed. 358 (1960), it is 
not necessary to allege injury to the public in a private treble damage action. "
547,3," .  We think that any effort to convert Section 7 of the Clayton Act into a per se violation of the anti-trust laws so as to give rise to 
a private right of action under the Clayton Act has been squarely checked by what is said by Mr. Chief Justice Warren in Brown 
Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 82 S.Ct. 1502, 8 L.Ed.2d 510. As interpreted in that case, Section 7 of the Clayton Act 
does not condemn all mergers, but only those having demonstrable anti-competitive effects.  The statute deals with clearcut 
menaces to competition, not with accomplished monopolies, presently creating damage to a competitor, which is the since qua 
non of a private right of action under Section 5 of the Clayton Act. Section 7 of the Clayton Act was intended to supplement the Sherman Act and: 'primarily to arrest apprehended consequences of intercorporate relationships before those relationships could work their evil, 
which may be at or any time after the acquisition, depending upon the circumstances of the particular case.' United States v. du Pont & Co., 353 U.S. 586, at 597, 77 S.Ct. 872, 1 L.Ed.2d 1057. See this same case, 366 U.S. 316, 325-
329, 81 S.Ct. 1243, 6 L.Ed.2d 318. That no private right of action accrues from such a violation, see; Independent Iron Works, 
Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., 322 F.2d 656 (9 Cir. 1963); United States v. Continental Can Co., D.C., 217 F.Supp. 761, 767 
(1963); United States v. Ingersoll-Rand Co., et al., 218 F.Supp. 530 (W.D.Penna.1963), aff'd 320 F.2d 509 (3 Cir. 1963); 
Gottesman v. General Motors Corp., 221 F.Supp. 488 (S.D.N.Y.1963). "
548,4," .  Seemingly, had pre-trial procedure been followed and a record thereof made, we would be informed of some facts which the 
District Court apparently considered pertinent when it came to prepare its memorandum opinion. "
553,1," .  Certain defendants made the original motions, other defendants joined in; some defendants did not join.  As an example, 
General Electric Company did not join in the motion in at least one of the cases (No. 18477), but was named as an appellee 
because of the effect of the appeal."
553,2," .  In No. 18474, all defendants had pleaded guilty in the original criminal actions in Pennsylvania. In No. 18475, all defendants had pleaded guilty. In No. 18476, all but one defendant had pleaded guilty, and it had pleaded nolo contendere. In No. 18477, all defendants had pleaded nolo contendere. In No. 18478, some defendants had pleaded guilty and some had pleaded nolo contendere."
553,3," .  The court below in its order certified (Tr. p. 161) that the 'court is of the opinion that the foregoing order involves a controlling 
question of law as to which there is substantial ground for differences of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order, 
pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. Section 1292(b) may materially advance an ultimate termination of this litigation.' "
554,4," .  Section 5(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended (15 U.S.C.  § 16(a)) provides: 'A final judgment or decree heretofore or hereafter rendered in any civil or criminal proceeding brought by or on behalf of the 
United States under the antitrust laws to the effect that a defendant has violated said laws shall be prima facie evidence against 
such defendant in any action or proceeding brought by any other party against such defendant under said laws or by the United 
States under section 15a of this title, as to all matters respecting which said judgment or decree would be an estoppel as 
between the parties thereto: Provided, That this section shall not apply to consent judgments or decrees entered before any 
testimony has been taken or to judgments or decrees entered in actions under section 15a of this title.' (Emphasis added.)"
554,5," .  A different panel than that hearing the appeal granted the application, by order dated March 8, 1963."
554,6," .  '(c) May a plaintiff properly rely, in his complaint, on prior Government proceedings where such reliance is germane to the 
statute of limitation.' (Application, p. 7.)"
554,7, .  The first four errors claimed by the appellant in Nos. 18477 and 18478 are:
554,1," .  The showings made by defendants in support of their contention that the allegations attached are 'immaterial, impertinent and 
prejudicial' were insufficient to sustain the granting of the motion."
554,2," .  The allegations are material and pertinent, and not subject to a 12(f) motion."
554,3," .  The order appealed from is erroneous insofar as it is based upon a determination that the allegations are wholly evidentiary 
and therefore violative of Rule 8(a)(2)."
554,4," .  The order constitutes a premature ruling on questions of evidence.  If these grounds are sound we never reach the fifth and 
controlling alleged error. "

F.Supp. 86; Seven-Up Company v. O-So Grape Co., S.D.Ill.1959, 179 F.Supp. 167."
555,9," .  Section 16(a) likewise excludes by this proviso suits under 15 U.S.C.  § 15a which are suits by the United States for injuries to 
its business or property.  This exclusion is not here relevant. "

Court.' United States v. Standard Ultramarine & Color Co., infra."
556,11," .  Rule 11, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure: 'Pleas "
557,," 'A defendant may plead not guilty, guilty or, with the consent of the court, nolo contendere. The court may refuse to accept a 
plea of guilty, and shall not accept the plea without first determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the 
nature of the charge.  If a defendant refuses to plead or if the court refuses to accept a plea of guilty or if a defendant corporation 
fails to appeal, the court shall enter a plea of not guilty.' "
560,12," .  While the court may refuse a plea of guilty, the refusal presumably applies essentially to 'un-understanding' individuals 
charged with ordinary federal crimes, comparable to state crimes, not to the usual corporate antitrust defendant. "
563,1," .  'II This Action Cannot Be Maintained Because It Was Not In Fact Filed by the Purported Plaintiff, The Progress Company. 'III The Undisputed Facts Show That The Progress Company Did Not Suffer Any Actionable Damage By Any Act of Appellees.'"
563,2," .  Amici Curiae lodged with the Clerk of this Court after the oral argument herein a motion for leave to file a brief.  That motion 
was denied but the cases the amici parties cited with the motion are here mentioned.  Amici differ with the agreed position taken 
by both parties to this appeal, that resort must be had to state law for the 'characterization' of the cause of action created by 15 
U.S.C.  § 15. Cited are Smith v. Cremins, 9 Cir. 1962, 308 F.2d 187, and Simler v. Connor, 1963, 372 U.S. 221, 83 S.Ct. 609, 9 
L.Ed.2d 691. The first case involves civil rights (42 U.S.C.  § 1983) and the action is upon a liability created by statute, 'different from any 
which would exist at common law is the absence of statute' (308 F.2d p. 190). But no 'penalty or forfeiture' exclusion is involved 
in Smith v. Cremins, or discussed therein. Simler v. Connor, supra, involves in a diversity case, in a suit for attorneys' fees, the question whether state or federal law 
controls as to whether the plaintiff was entitled to a jury trial. We see no controlling force in either of these opinions with respect to the issues presented in this case."
563,3," .  (a) 'Since the antitrust laws specify no statute of limitations for private damage actions, courts look to state law. This approach, 
however, has produced more questions than answers.' (The Report of The Attorney General's Committee to Study the Antitrust 
Laws, p. 381 (1955).) (b) 'In the federal statute of limitations, the allied tolling provisions, and other important provisions in the statutory scheme, there 
are critical terms and phrases which require more precise definition than Congress has seen fit to provide.  The courts have 
attempted to provide the needed definitions, but these judicial elaborations are as often confusing and contradictory as they are 
helpful.' (Wiprud, G.W., 'Antitrust Treble Damage Suits Against Electrical Manufacturers: The Statute of Limitations and Other 
Hurdles.' 57 Northwestern Univ.L.Rev. 29 (1962). "
564,4," .  This court has stated in so many words, 'An action to recover damages resulting from a violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust 
Act is not an action to recover a penalty.' Hicks v. Bekins Moving and Storage Co., 9 Cir. 1937, 87 F.2d 583, relying solely on 
Chattanooga Foundry & Pipe Works v. City of Atlanta, 1906, 203 U.S. 390, 397, 27 S.Ct. 65, 51 L.Ed. 241. Chattanooga is 
mentioned later, in the quotation of Judge Mathes' opinion below.  The only two cases cited in Chattanooga to support the 
court's conclusion are: Huntington v. Attrill, 1892, 146 U.S. 657, 658, 13 S.Ct. 224, 36 L.Ed. 1123, and Brady v. Daly, 1899, 175 
U.S. 148, 155, 156, 20 S.Ct. 62, 44 L.Ed. 109. These are also cited in Judge Mathes' memorandum decision. And see note 7,

567,7," .   Concerning Chattanooga, supra, the second circuit distinguished it in these words: 'Considered in the light of these principles, the Supreme Court's decision in Chattanooga Foundry & Pipe Works v. City of 
Atlanta, 203 U.S. 390, 27 S.Ct. 65, 66, 51 L.Ed. 241, is not decisive of this case.  There the Supreme Court held that an action 
for treble damages under the anti-trust laws was not an action for a penalty within the meaning of the federal statute of 
limitations for penal suits (note).  But the word 'penalty' in a federal statute has a different meaning than the same word in the 
New York statute.  The federal statute of limitations for penal actions applies only to actions on behalf of the United States and 
qui tam actions.  Huntington v. Attrill, 146 U.S. 657, 668, 673, 13 S.Ct. 224, 36 L.Ed. 1123. The New York three year statute by 
its express terms applies to actions 'by the person aggrieved' and thus, unlike the federal statute, applies to private actions.

sustained by plaintiffs is only a base upon which the sanction of treble damages is superimposed.  Thus, the fundamentally

578,1," Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act provide in pertinent part: ""SEC. 1. Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among 
the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal. . . . ""SEC. 2. Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or 
persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed 
guilty of a misdemeanor. . . ."""
578,2," That issue was put to rest by  United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 350-355. "
579,3," In view of our disposition of the case we find it unnecessary to determine whether trust department services alone are another 
relevant market."
579,4," Small loan companies make personal loans of $ 800 or less at interest rates higher than those charged by commercial banks.  
Since commercial banks carry a large volume of demand deposits, their real estate loans are generally of a shorter duration than 
those offered by savings and loan associations or insurance companies."
579,5," The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve Board used Fayette County as the geographical market, the 
latter saying that ""since there are no concentrations of population in other counties close enough to create competition with other 
banks, the competitive effects of the proposed consolidation would be confined to the Lexington banks."" "
582,6," Two of which had been decided after Standard Oil Co. v.  United States, 221 U.S. 1, which announced ""the rule of reason."" "
583,1," Compare the dissenting opinion in  United States v. Columbia Steel Co., 334 U.S. 495, 534."
583,2," The reason for singling out this aspect of the banks' activities is unclear, since the Court does not determine even whether trust 
department services should be regarded as a relevant market. See ante, p. 667, note 3.  In view of the majority's disposition of 
the case, I do not set out here my reasons for believing that the District Court's determination that the consolidation in question 
does not violate § 2 of the Sherman Act (monopoly) should be affirmed."
583,3," United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U.S. 218, cited by the Court, ante, p. 671, is wholly irrelevant. "

Southern Pacific Co., 259 U.S. 214."
584,5," United States v. Reading Co., 253 U.S. 26, 59."
584,6," The presumption which the Court laid down in  Philadelphia National Bank, supra, at 363, that ""a merger which produces a firm 
controlling an undue percentage share of the relevant market, and results in a significant increase in the concentration of firms in 
that market, is . . . inherently likely to lessen competition substantially . . ."" was concerned with the application of § 7 of the 
Clayton Act. Compare Times-Picayune Pub. Co. v.  United States, 345 U.S. 594, 612, a Sherman Act case in which the Court 
noted that ""no magic inheres in numbers,"" and quoted with approval the statement in  Columbia Steel, supra, at 528, that ""the 
relative effect of percentage command of a market varies with the setting in which that factor is placed."""
584,7," As found by the District Court, in 1960, First National had ""total assets of $ 65,069,000, total deposits of $ 58,673,000 and total 
net loans and discounts of $ 35,434,000.""  208 F.Supp., at 459. Security Trust, in 1960, had ""total assets of $ 21,033,000, total 
deposits of $ 17,402,000 and total net loans and discounts of $ 12,317,000."" Ibid. "
585,8," The only contrary evidence, testimony of presidents of three of the four competing local banks who ""expressed considerable 
fear that the consolidation would result in serious loss to the other banks and would be disastrous to some of them,""  208 
F.Supp., at 460, was discredited by the District Court.  See supra, p. 674."
585,9," With reference to the probable development of the industry, the Government turns to the past and notes that the number of 
local banks decreased from 10 to 7 between 1929 and 1938; but this statistic, more at home in a Clayton Act case, is of doubtful 
significance in the present context, particularly in view of the period during which the decrease occurred.  The same may be said 
of the Government's reference to the testimony of the president of a competing bank that the consolidation from which his bank 
resulted was carried through (years before the First Security consolidation) principally to enable it ""to better compete with the 
First National."" In fact, in the three years since the First Security consolidation, there has been no further concentration. "
586,10," It is one thing to say, as the Court did in Times-Picayune, supra, at 609, that ""the Clayton Act's more specific standards 
illuminate the public policy which the Sherman Act was designed to subserve . . . ."" It is quite another thing to treat them as 
interchangeable.  See id., at 609-610. "

616,1," .  The aforesaid effects include the actual or potential lessening of competition and a tendency to create a monopoly in the 
following ways, among others:"
616,1," .  Minnesota Mining, as the largest producer of electrical insulation tape, and with its acquisitions of leading manufacturers of 
other electrical insulation products, by acquiring two of the three largest distributors of electrical insulation products in the United 
States has extended and integrated its business in such a manner as to substantially increase its position in the manufacture, 
sale and distribution of electrical insulation products; and it may exercise the inherent powers of its acquired position to 
substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in the manufacture, sale and distribution of electrical insulation 
products."
616,2," .  Manufacturers of electrical insulation products have been foreclosed from a substantial share of the markets for said 
products."
616,3," .  Competition has been eliminated between Prehler and IWI in the distribution and sale of electrical insulation products in the 
sections of the country in which they were competing, and potential competition has been eliminated between said companies 
throughout the United States."
616,4, .  Actual and potential competition has been eliminated between Minnesota Mining and the two acquired distributors.
616,5," .  As a leading manufacturer and distributor of electrical insulation products Minnesota Mining has acquired a position whereby 
it may: (a) Manipulate prices or use other means to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly; and "
617,," (b) Concentrate the full impact of its sales, promotional and merchandising experience and ability on one of its electrical 
insulation products, or on one selected section of the country. (6) Concentration of the manufacture, sale and distribution of electrical insulation products may be increased."
617,2," .  The First paragraph of Section 5 (now 5(a) (15 U.S.C.  § 16(a)) provides: 'A final judgment or decree heretofore or hereafter rendered in any civil or criminal proceeding brought by or on behalf of the 
United States under the antitrust laws to the effect that a defendant has violated said laws shall be prima facie evidence against 
such defendant in any action or proceeding brought by any other party against such defendant under said laws or by the United 
States under section 4A, as to all matters respecting which said judgment or decree would be an estoppel as between the 
parties thereto: Provided, That this section shall not apply to consent judgments or decrees entered before any testimony has 
been taken or to judgments or decrees entered in actions under section 4A.' The second paragraph of Section 5 (now 5(b)) (15 U.S.C.  § 16(b)) provides: 'Whenever any civil or criminal proceeding is instituted by the United States to prevent, restrain, or punish violations of any of the 
antitrust laws, * * * the running of the statute of limitations in respect of every private right of action arising under said laws and 
based in whole or in part on any matter complained of in said proceeding shall be suspended during the pendency thereof and 
for one year thereafter: Provided, however, That whenever the running of the statute of limitations in respect of a cause of action 
arising under section 4 is suspended hereunder, any action to enforce such cause of action shall be forever barred unless 
commenced either within the period of suspension or within four years after the cause of action accrued.' "
618,3," .  These 'antitrust laws' are: The Sherman Act (Act of July 2, 1890, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209); The Clayton Act (Act of October 15, 
1914, c. 323, 38 Stat. 730); and the Wilson Tariff Act (Act of August 27, 1894, c. 349, Section 73-77, 28 Stat. 57 as amended Act 
of February 12, 1913, c. 40, 37 Stat. 667)."
618,4," .  'At the time of enactment of the Sherman Act, the major emphasis was upon methods of enforcement, and it was believed that 
the most effective method, in addition to the imposition of penalties by the United States, was to provide for private treble 
damage suits.  It was originally hoped that this would encourage private litigants to bear a considerable amount of the burden 
and expense of enforcement and thus save the Government time and money. 'The enactment of the Clayton Act, in 1914 was in part a recognition by the Congress that section 7 of the Sherman Act had not 
successfully stimulated private litigation for enforcement of the Sherman Act. * * * 'Since the enactment of the Clayton Act, the bulk of private antitrust litigation has followed successful Government action, so that 
the judgments and decrees in the Federal proceedings could be used to establish a case.  Amassing evidence (sic) for antitrust 
cases would otherwise be a prohibitively expensive task for most plaintiffs.' S.Rep. No. 619, 84 Cong., 1st Sess. June 21, 1955; 
U.S.Code Cong. & Ad.News, p. 2329 (1955)."
618,5," .  The Sherman Act was the first piece of Federal Antitrust legislation.  Passed in 1890, the act sought to protect commerce 
against unlawful restraints and monopolies, and preserve freedom of competition.  Act of July 2, 1890, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209.  
Standard Oil of New Jersey v. United States, 221 U.S. 1, 50, 52, 31 S.Ct. 502, 55 L.Ed. 619 (1911). The era in which it was 
enacted was one 'of trusts' and ""combinations' of businesses and of capital organized and directed to control of the market by 
suppression of competition in the marketing of goods and services, the monopolistic tendency of which had become a matter of 
public concern.' Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 491-493, 60 S.Ct. 982, 992, 84 L.Ed. 1311 (1940). The Sherman Act 
was not only an immediate legislative answer to this threat, but a declaration of policy as well.  It was basically a criminal statute, 
but Section 4 of that act also provided for enforcement by civil actions by the Justice Department through the various United 
States Attorneys.  Section 7 also gave a private right of action for treble damages. This latter section was for practical purposes 
absorbed in Section 4 of the Clayton Act of 1914, but its repeal was not pronounced until 1955. Act of July 7, 1955, c. 283, 3, 69 
Stat. 283. "
619,6," .  The Sherman Act applied solely to consummated contracts and conspiracies. Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United 
States, 221 U.S. 1, 58, 31 S.Ct. 502, 55 L.Ed. 619 (1911); Standard Fashion Co. v. Magrane-Houston Co., 258 U.S. 346, 355, 
46 S.Ct. 360, 66 L.Ed. 653 (1922). In 1914, Congress enacted the Clayton Act which sought to reach certain specific practices, 
considered dangerous to free competition in commerce and trade, but not covered by the Sherman Act, Act of October 15, 1914, 
c. 323, 38 Stat. 730.  Standard Fashion Company v. Magrane-Houston Co., 258 U.S. 346, 356, 46 S.Ct. 360, 66 L.Ed. 653 
(1922); Corn Products Refining Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 324 U.S. 726, 738, 65 S.Ct. 961, 89 L.Ed. 1320 (1945). It was 
thought that by making these practices illegal, the creation of trusts, conspiracies and monopolies would be arrested in their 
inception.  See United States v. United Shoe Machinery Co., 264 F. 138, 162 (E.D.Mo.1920), quoting the report of the Senate 
Committee."
619,7," .  From the House version of the Clayton bill (H.R. 15657) the Senate Committee had stricken what eventually became Sections 
2 and 3 of the Act because it felt that these 'unfair methods of competition' would be covered by Section 5 of the FTC Act.  A 
long debate ensued in the Senate.  See 51 Cong.Rec. 13963, 14088-14100; 14200-14229; 14249-14276 (1914).  Finally the 
Senate voted to restore them to the Clayton bill, mainly for the reasons stated by Senator Clapp: to declare these practices 
unlawful specifically and withdraw them from the judgment of the commission, 51 Cong.Rec. 14257 (1914). "
620,8," .  We do not consider that Section 11(e) of the Clayton Act or the case of United States v. W. T. Grant, 345 U.S. 629, 632, 73 
S.Ct. 894, 97 L.Ed. 1303 (1953) compels the conclusion that both the FTC and the Justice Department can bring separate 
proceedings against a single defendant for the same alleged violation under Section 11. Rather Section 11(e) would seem to 
indicate that a suit by the FTC under Section 11 should not work to relieve a defendant from a private antitrust suit.  15 U.S.C. 
21(e) (1958).  See 51 Cong.Rec. 16274 (1914)."
620,9," .   Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 324 U.S. 439, 65 S.Ct. 716, 89 L.Ed. 1051 (1945); United States v. Borden Co., 308 U.S.

(1962). "
621,10," .   Opinion by Mr. Justice Brennan at 374 U.S. p. 346, 83 S.Ct. p. 1732, 10 L.Ed.2d 915. 'The legislative history shows that the objective of including the phrase 'corporation subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal 
Trade Commission' in 7 was not to limit the amalgamations to be covered by the amended statute but to make explicit the role of 
the FTC in administering the section.  The predominant focus of the hearings, debates, and committee reports was upon the 
powers of the FTC * * * Furthermore, although the Clayton Act has always provided for dual enforcement by court and agency 
(cites), prior to the 1950 amendment enforcement of § 7 was left largely to the FTC.  Martin, Mergers and the Clayton Act 
(1959), 205, 219; Montague, The Cellar Anti-Merger Act: An Administrative Problem in an Economic Crisis, 37 A.B.A.J. 253 
(1951). And the impetus to amend 7 came in large part from the FTC (cites).  Congress in 1950 clearly intended to remove all 
question concerning the FTC's remedial power over corporate acquisitions, and therefore explicitly enlarge the FTC's 
jurisdiction.' See also Mr. Justice Harlan's dissent 374 U.S. at p. 392, 83 S.Ct. 1715, 10 L.Ed.2d 915, supra."

625,13," .  When the FTC bill reported out of the Senate Committee June 13, 1914, (S.Rep. No. 597, 63 Cong.2d Sess. (1914)), it 
reflected a desire for a Commission with the same 'effective powers and usefulness as had been given the ICC.' 51 Cong.Rec. 
10376 (1914). The floor debates in the Senate reveal a recurring Congressional feeling for an FTC functioning like the ICC.  
Distinctions and similarities were consistently noted.  Representative Covington said: 'There is, however, a perfect analogy between the former power of the Interstate Commerce Commission under the Cullom Act 
and the power of the Federal Trade Commission.  Under the Cullom Act, the Interstate Commerce Commission had the power to 
determine whether an existing rate was unreasonable, and, if it is so found, to order the railroad to cease and desist from 
charging that rate. 'The Federal Trade Commission will have precisely similar power in regard to an existing method of competition.  It is instructive 
therefore to bear in mind that the orders of the Commission under that act were not final but were subject to review by the 
courts.' 51 Cong.Rec. 14932 (1914). Also, in the Senate report in the Clayton Bill (S.Rep. No. 698, 63 Cong.2d Sess. 1914), the Committee recommended the 
change in Section 5(a) from 'conclusive evidence' to 'prima facie evidence'.  At P. 45, it drew the analogy of the use of a tax 
deed as evidence of title, citing Cooley in Taxation, 521, 5th Ed. 1886, and Marx v. Hanthorn, 148 U.S. 172, 183, 13 S.Ct. 508, 
37 L.Ed. 410 (1893). These same thoughts are expressed in the ICC-Meeker case, supra, which cites Marx v. Hanthorn.  Such 
Congressional thinking tends to show that the 1914 legislator would not be adverse to the use of affirmed FTC orders as prima 
facie evidence. "

639,1," Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, as amended by the Celler-Kefauver Antimerger Act, 64 Stat. 1125, 15 U. S. C. § 18, 
provides in relevant part: ""No corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share 
capital and no corporation subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission shall acquire the whole or any part of the 
assets of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where in any line of commerce in any section of the country, the effect 
of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly."""
639,2," Both parties and the District Court refer to this as an interindustry merger. The word ""industry"" is susceptible of more than one 
meaning.  It might be defined in terms of end uses for which various products compete; so defined it would be roughly equivalent 
to the concept of a ""line of commerce."" According to this interpretation the glass and metal container businesses, to the extent 
they compete, are in the same industry.  On the other hand, ""industry"" might also denote an aggregate of enterprises employing 
similar production and marketing facilities and producing products having markedly similar characteristics.  In many instances, 
the segments of economic endeavor embraced by these two concepts of ""industry"" will be substantially coextensive, since those 
who employ the same types of machinery to turn out the same general product often compete in the same market.  Since this is 
not such a case it will be helpful to use the word ""industry"" as referring to similarity of production facilities and products.  So 
viewed, ""interindustry competition"" becomes a meaningful concept. "
640,3," The District Court found that the basic raw material used in the manufacture of cans, and the major cost factor bearing on their 
price is tin-coated steel (tin plate).  In some instances uncoated steel (blackplate) or aluminum is used instead of tin plate.  Other 
raw materials include soldering compounds, paints, varnishes, lithographic inks, paper and cartons for packaging.  Cans are 
rigid and unbreakable, can be hermetically sealed and are impermeable to gases.  They are lighter than glass containers, can be 
heat-processed faster, and are not chemically inert. Forty-nine members of the metal can industry are organized in a trade association known as the Can Manufacturers Institute 
which maintains a professional staff of three.  Acting largely through committees, it deals with various technical problems of the 
industry and carries out some promotional activities emphasizing the advantages of the metal can."
640,4," According to the findings of the District Court, glass containers are made principally from sand, lime, and soda ash, and the 
major factor in determining their price is the cost of labor.  Glass containers are rigid, breakable, and chemically inert.  They can 
be hermetically sealed and, unlike many cans, can be easily resealed after they have been opened.  The industry recognizes 
two basic types of containers, the wide mouth and the narrow neck.  Members of this industry also have a trade association, the 
Glass Container Manufacturers Institute, which, through its 45 employees and its standing committees, carries on such activities 
as market research and promotion, technical research, package design and specifications, the development of standard testing 
and quality control procedures, problems of freight rates, labor relations, and liaison work with government.  In recent decades 
the expansion of the glass container industry has been more rapid than, and often realized at the expense of, the metal can 
industry.  During World War II, for example, substantial increments in the market served by glass container manufacturers were 
made possible by the short supply of tin plate. The third industry found by the District Court to be involved in this multi-industry competitive picture was the plastic container 
industry, which, though a relative newcomer, has enjoyed impressive growth since making its debut in the mid-1940's.  Its dollar 
sales volume is small compared with that of its metal and glass counterparts, but its growth has been and continues to be steady 
and rapid. "
642,5," In 1952 Continental ran a series of advertisements emphasizing the following ""5 reasons why cans are an ideal container for 
baby foods:"" ""1. ECONOMICAL.  Baby food in cans is usually priced as low or lower than baby food packed in other containers. ""2. STERILE.  Processing sterilizes the inside, and light, dust and germs can't get into a hermetically sealed can. ""3. EXTRA SAFETY.  Cans are sealed to stay sealed until the consumer opens them. ""4. SHATTERPROOF.  Steel and tin won't break, shatter or chip. ""5. SAFE FOR LEFT-OVERS.  Food can be safely left in the can, just keep it covered and under refrigeration."" "
643,6," Consumer preferences for glass or metal are often regional and traceable to factors other than the intrinsic superiority of the 
preferred container. For example, the one-way beer bottle was highly successful in Baltimore -- due in part to the efforts of ""a 
highly motivated leading brewer"" -- but failed to make headway in Detroit.  And though glass appears to have about 80% of the 
Nation's baby food business, as of the time of the merger cans had over 60% of the business west of the Mississippi.  According 
to one opinion in the record, all Canadian baby food moves in cans.  And an official of the Glass Container Manufacturers 
Institute reported to that body that pickles, preserves, and jams are packed in tin cans in Canada."
643,7," Ford Sammis & Company, a firm of market economists, conducted for the Glass Container Manufacturers Institute market 
surveys of 28 different product classifications.  On the basis of over 3 1/4 million individual answers to questions asked in more 
than 12,000 personal interviews, Ford Sammis concluded the following: "
644,," ""Every consumer product tends to standardize on a single type of container. Glass has become the standard, traditional 
container for a host of products, including catsup, salad dressings, salad oil, instant coffee, prune juice, mayonnaise, peanut 
butter, jams and syrup.  Other products have standardized on tin cans -- regular coffee, evaporated milk, dog food, and most 
fruits, vegetables and juices. ""However, no traditional market is ever secure for any type of container. Marketers are apt to try out new containers at any time, 
in their constant search for ways to increase sales. ""When this happens, the result is a period of container competition, which may run through one or more of three separate 
stages."""
644,1," . Stage 1, according to the Sammis report, occurs when a new type of container is first introduced by a secondary brand. Thus 
""[a] new container can become a potent sales force for a brand, if strong consumer preference exists (or is promoted) for that 
type of container. Recognizing this, secondary brands are constantly trying out new types of containers as sales incentive.  
While leading brands are ordinarily satisfied to maintain the status quo, secondary brands are willing to gamble to improve their 
positions."""
644,2," . The second stage comes about in this manner: ""If a secondary brand increases its sales during the period when it is 
introducing a new type of container, the sales increase is usually attributed to the new container, by marketer and competitors 
alike.  Advertising, product changes or other factors may actually be more important than the new container, but circumstantial 
evidence points to the container. ""Leading brands are not prone to sit idly by while competitors cut into their share of the market.  They tend to cover competitors' 
bets by offering both traditional and new types of containers to their customers. This creates Stage 2 of container competition."""
644,3," . ""When leading brands are available in a choice of containers, consumers' container preference is no longer in conflict with 
their brand preferences.  They can have the brand they want in the container they want.  Sales of leading brands under these 
circumstances seek the level of consumer preference for each type of container. ""If preference for one type of container greatly exceeds preference for the other type, the products then tends [sic] eventually to 
standardize once again on a single type of container -- the container most consumers prefer.  This process is subject to 
promotion of container by brand marketers or container manufacturers. The alternate outcome can be favorable to either the 
new or the traditional container."""
644,8," The chairman of the board of Owens-Illinois Glass Co. testified that he takes into account the price of metal containers in 
pricing glass containers for beer, soft drinks, and household and chemical products, and to a lesser degree for toiletries and 
cosmetics.  In assessing the likelihood that it could ""penetrate [the] tremendous market"" for soft drink containers Continental 
concluded ""assuming that the merchandising factors are favorable and that the product quality is well received, the upper limit on 
market acceptance will then be determined by price."" Continental also stated in an intercompany memorandum that in the fight 
between the beer can and the one-way bottle ""the key factor, in our estimation, is pricing,"" and concluded that a reduction in the 
price of one-way beer bottles was to ""be regarded as a further attempt on the part of the glass manufacturers to maintain their 
position in the one-way package field."" "
645,9," An official of the Glass Container Manufacturers Institute described that organization's advertising program as three-pronged, 
directed at the packer, the retailer, and the ultimate consumer. "
646,10," Determination of market shares is made somewhat more difficult in this case than in the ordinary intraindustry merger because 
the indices of total production of the two industries are expressed differently, the metal container industry reporting to the 
Census Bureau in terms of tinplate consumed in manufacture, and the glass container industry in terms of units of containers. 
On the basis of figures and data supplied by the Census Bureau and the Can Manufacturers Institute the Government has 
derived a conversion factor showing the relationship between tinplate consumption and total containers manufactured, thereby 
permitting a comparison of the relative positions of the firms competing within the glass and metal container line of commerce. It 
would appear that the District Court relied on figures disclosed by application of this factor, since it found that American and 
Continental shipped approximately 38% and 33%, respectively, of the metal cans sold in the United States.   217 F.Supp., at 
773. Continental objects to the use of this conversion scheme, however, arguing that it ignores such considerations as size of cans 
and the returnable feature of some types of bottles. We are not persuaded.  Since different systems of statistical notation are 
employed by these industries, a common referential standard is an absolute prerequisite to a comparison of market shares.  
Consistent with this Court's declarations in other cases concerning the high degree of relevance of market shares to the effect of 
mergers on competition, we believe that slight variations one way or the other which may inhere in the use of a conversion 
formula should not blind us to the broad significance of the resulting percentages.  In the compilation of statistics ""precision in 
detail is less important than the accuracy of the broad picture presented."" Brown Shoe Co. v.  United States, 370 U.S., at 342, n. 
69. "
647,11," The six largest firms, and their respective percentages of the relevant market as of the year prior to the merger are: American Can Co"
647,26, .8% Continental Can Co
647,21, .9% Owens-Illinois Glass Co
647,11, .2% Anchor-Hocking Glass Co
647,3, .8% National Can Co
647,3, .3% Hazel-Atlas Glass Co
647,3, .1% Total
647,70, .1% 
650,1," Both companies manufactured other related products which for present purposes may be disregarded.  See the description of 
the two companies in the opinion of the District Court,  217 F.Supp. 761, 769-770."
650,2," Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Act of December 29, 1950, 64 Stat. 1125, 15 U. S. C. § 18, provides in 
pertinent part: ""No corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share 
capital and no corporation subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission shall acquire the whole or any part of the 
assets of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where in any line of commerce in any section of the country, the effect 
of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly."" "
651,3," The Court confesses to some difficulty in determining market shares.  See ante, pp. 459-460, n. 10."
651,4," ""We have no difficulty in determining the 'line of commerce' (relevant product or services market) . . . in which to appraise the 
probable competitive effects of appellees' proposed merger. We agree with the District Court that the cluster of products (various 
kinds of credit) and services (such as checking accounts and trust administration) denoted by the term 'commercial banking' . . . 
composes a distinct line of commerce. . . .  In sum, it is clear that commercial banking is a market 'sufficiently inclusive to be 
meaningful in terms of trade realities.' Crown Zellerbach Corp. v.  Federal Trade Comm'n, 296 F.2d 800, 811 (C. A. 9th Cir. 
1961).""  374 U.S., at 356-357."
651,5," In the District Court, the Government relied on 10 ""lines of commerce."" In addition to ""the packaging industry,"" ""the can 
industry,"" ""the glass container industry,"" and ""metal closures"" (not relevant here), the Government argued that there were six 
""lines of commerce"" which were defined by the end product for which the containers were used, e. g., ""containers for the beer 
industry."" See  217 F.Supp., at 778-779."
651,6," Although the Government makes the suggestion, which the Court now accepts, that wherever there is competition there is a 
""line of commerce,"" so that ""the 'line of commerce' within which the merger's effect on competition should be appraised is the 
production and sale of containers used for all purposes for which metal or glass containers may be used . . ."" (Brief, p. 18), it 
concedes the artificiality of this approach and, in so doing, itself rejects the market-share analysis adopted by the Court.  The 
Government states that its suggested test of illegality of a merger involving inter-industry competition ""omits analysis of statistics 
regarding market shares simply because those traditional yardsticks are generally unavailable to measure the full consequences 
which an interindustry merger would have on competition."" (Brief, p. 22.) The test which the Government advocates is that it ""can satisfy its burden of showing that the merger may have the effect of 
substantially lessening competition by proving (a) the existence of substantial competition between two industries; (b) a high 
degree of concentration in either or both of the competing industries; and (c) the dominant positions of each of the merging 
companies in its respective industry."" (Brief, p. 22.) This approach, which has at least the virtue of facing up to its own logic, 
frankly disavows attention to a ""line of commerce."" The effect of the Court's approach is not markedly different from that of the 
Government's test, see infra, p. 476, and there is some suggestion in the last few pages of the Court's opinion that the Court 
appreciates this.  As discussed hereafter, however, there is nothing in the Court's opinion to support adoption of the "
652,," Government's ""per se"" approach, and the facts developed in the District Court demonstrate that, so far as one can tell from this 
case at least, a per se approach to the problem of inter-industry competition is wholly inappropriate."
652,7," If the competition between metal and glass containers is sufficient to constitute them collectively a ""line of commerce,"" why 
does their competition with plastic containers and ""other materials competing for the same business"" not require that all such 
containers be included in the same line of commerce? The Court apparently concedes that the competition is multilateral."
652,8," The ""practical indicia"" specified by the Court were: ""industry or public recognition of the submarket as a separate economic 
entity, the product's peculiar characteristics and uses, unique production facilities, distinct customers, distinct prices, sensitivity 
to price changes, and specialized vendors.""  370 U.S., at 325 (footnote omitted).  While many of these factors weigh against the 
Court's conclusion that metal and glass containers should be combined in a single line of commerce, not one of them speaks for 
the Court's conclusion that they should be segregated from all other kinds of containers and together form a separate line of 
commerce."
652,9," The District Court observed also that ""relevant markets are neither economic abstractions nor artificial conceptions.""  217 
F.Supp., at 768. In this respect, in view of the majority's present opinion, the district judge must, I suppose, be deemed to have 
erred. "
653,10," This summary of the District Court's findings includes only so much as is relevant to the majority's opinion.  The District Court 
gave detailed attention to each of the Government's contentions, in an opinion of 48 pages.  Its conclusions were summarized in 
the following statement: ""Viewing the evidence as a whole, quite apart from theory, there was a total failure by the Government to establish the essential 
elements of a violation of Section 7.  As will be apparent from a discussion of the proof relating to each specific line of 
commerce, the Government did not lay either the statistical or testimonial foundations required to establish its case.  It was this 
failure of proof which required the dismissal of the complaint and entry of judgment for the defendants.""  217 F.Supp., at 787."
653,11," See note 6, supra. "
654,12," The Government urged other lines of commerce below, see note 5, supra, but has abandoned all of them here except 
""containers for the canning industry,"" a line of commerce defined by end use and including ""all metal cans and glass containers 
for the end uses of 'canning' food.""  217 F.Supp., at 799. The District Court gave detailed reasons, which the record fully 
supports, for rejecting the Government's contention that this was a distinct line of commerce. See  217 F.Supp., at 799-802. "
656,1," .  'Load factor' is the ratio between a buyer's average daily purchases and its contract demand, the maximum volume it has a 
right to take under its contract."
656,2, .  There is also a 'facility charge' for services rendered by means of a lateral supply line.  This charge is applicable to Lynchburg. 
657,3," .  Aside from Lynchburg's contractual obligations to Seaboard it would still seem to be in Lynchburg's interest for it to apportion 
its purchases between Seaboard and Transco.  Transco's rates presently applicable to Lynchburg are based on Transco's 'G' 
schedule which applies only to customers with contract demands of 5,000 Mcf. or less.  Transco's regular 'CD-2' schedule at the 
time of the hearing provided for a minimum demand charge of $ 3.70 per Mcf. and a commodity charge of 25 cents per Mcf.  If 
Lynchburg were so to increase its purchases form Transco as to exceed the 'G' schedule limit it would then have to pay the 
higher demand charge provided for in Transco's 'CD-2' schedule.  And under this schedule it would seem that Lynchburg would 
benefit by apportioning its purchases between Seaboard and Transco so as to purchase from the latter only a high load factor."

660,7," .  In a further attempt to show the necessity of the PR schedule Columbia introduced a hypothetical study predicting the effect 
upon the Columbia companies of a substantial loss in base load sales.  However, the trial examiner dismissed the probative 
value of this study, saying that it was speculative, based on unproven assumptions and contained mere assertions of possibility."
660,8," .  It should be noted that minimum commodity bills for partial requirements customers are fairly common throughout the natural 
gas industry.  However, the fact that other PR schedules might be valid does not mean that the schedule now under review is 
similarly valid. "
661,1," .  'The evidence shows that the savings in costs will be substantial if Lynchburg is permitted to purchase part of its gas from 
Transco.  Under Lynchburg's rules and regulations such savings will be passed on to its customers in the form of a reduction in 
the general service rate.' This was the Commission's own language in authorizing service from Transco. (Emphasis added)."
661,2," .  In this connection it is relevant to note Lynchburg's contention that substantially all of Columbia's sales are to customers that 
have access to alternative sources of supply."
661,3," .  Were it found that the P-R schedule were less restrictive and that the restriction was the minimum compatible with a 
reasonable concept of 'fair return', it would still be necessary to determine whether Lynchburg was being required to bear an 
'excessive' share of the burden.  The Commission should also ascertain so far as it is administratively practicable the extent to 
which suppliers in competition with Columbia, such as Transco, will be forced to raise their rates, as a result of the business 
taken by Columbia under the P-R schedule.  And the Commission should also make clear what it means by 'fair return' and 'fair 
share.' "
678,1," .  The claim for injunctive relief is brought under the provisions of 15 U.S.C.  § 26. Plaintiffs also seek treble damages for injuries

reference --  either directly or indirectly --  to such defense, whereas 15 U.S.C.  § 26 very pointedly refers to the prior rules and 
principles of equity, of which the unclean hands doctrine has been a traditional mainstay. The injunction provision of 15 U.S.C.  § 
26 provides in pertinent part that: 'any person * * * shall be entitled to * * * injunctive relief * * * against threatened loss or damage * * * of the antitrust laws * * *,

business after its sale to Certain-teed.  With the exception of Mr. Reichel, who has already been mentioned in the opinion (see 
page 9), none of these employees who testified at the trial (Criminal No. 21118) were policy-making employees with K & M (Mr. 
Mashburn, N.T. 296, 312; Mr. Prechek, N.T. 750-753; Mr. Conner, N.T. 807; Mr. Clubb, N.T. 1007-1010, 1034; Mr. Outlaw, N.T.

722,8," .  At the oral argument on the instant motion, the trial judge urged the Government to get on the record the significance of 
owning 20% Of the stock of a corporation such as Certain-teed (see pages 53-60 of Document 35), but the Government has 
failed to supplement the record on this point. "

Jury Investigation, Document 1 of Misc. No. 2372, K & M has been subjected to Government searches, examinations of its files, 
and questioning with regard to possible antitrust violations in the asbestos-cement pipe industry since the fall of 1956.  
Subpoenas were issued dated March 17, 1958, August 1, 1958, June 13, 1961, and January 23, 1962, requesting the 
production of documents from K & M.  At least eight employees of K & M testified before grand juries in April of 1958 (this Grand 
Jury was impaneled in May 1957, as shown in affidavit of Lindsay in In the Matter of Grand Jury Subpoenas, Turner & Newall, 
Limited, Document 4 of Misc. No. 2005) and May of 1959.  In light of the continuing investigations by the Government and the 
two grand jury proceedings prior to the one which handed down the indictment on June 1, 1962, K & M had no reason to 
suppose, in the winter and spring of 1962, that the current grand jury would return an indictment. For this reason, the record 
would not justify the drawing of an inference that K & M sold its asbestos-cement pipe business in April 1962 to avoid 
prosecution under the antitrust laws. Also, it is noted that there is no evidence that Mr. Soothill or Mr. Bateman had direct policy-making contacts with K & M on more 
than an annual basis, when trips would be made to this country. There is no evidence of illegal action by these English citizens. "

be denied access to courts, especially in this day of big and expensive patent and antitrust litigation. Nonetheless, group action of any sort runs the risk of being cast in simple terms of ""ganging up on the little guy."" ""The harsh 
judicial attitude toward group boycott stems partly from the assumption that group action directed against individuals involves an 
inherent imbalance in economic power, which may or may not be true depending on the relative market position of the individual

column VII in the foregoing Schedule of Machines. The lessee shall also pay to the United Corporation such sum as may be 
necessary to cover replacement at the regular prices established by the United Corporation therefor of all broken or missing 
parts."" The complaint also sets forth the monthly minimum charge on unit charge machine clause as a means whereby United 
monopolized the shoe machinery industry to the detriment of lessees, including Hanover.  In its brief and proposed findings of 
fact and conclusions of law, however, Hanover did not point to this clause as a means of monopolization."
815,2," It is the conduct of United under this clause, rather than the clause itself, that Judge Wyzanski found to be a means by which 
United controlled the shoe machinery market. "
816,3," The court clearly indicated this in the following parts of its opinion (page numbers refer to 110 F. Supp.). ""The effect of United's leasing system as it works in practice may be examined from the viewpoints of United, of the shoe 
manufacturers, and of competitors potential or actual.  p. 323 ""Yet as already noted, a shoe manufacturer may psychologically or economically be more impeded by a leasing than by a selling 
system.  And this general observation is buttressed by a study of features in the United leasing system which have a special 
deterrent effect.  Though these features are stated separately, and some of them alone are important impediments, they must be 
appraised collectively to appreciate the full deterrent effect.  p. 324 ""However, United's leases, in the context of the present shoe machinery market, have created barriers to the entry by 
competitors into the shoe machinery field.  p. 340 ""First, the complex of obligations and rights accruing under United's leasing system in operation deter a shoe manufacturer from 
disposing of a United machine and acquiring a competitor's machine. He is deterred more than if he owned that same United 
machine, or if he held it on a short lease carrying simple rental provisions and a reasonable charge for cancellation before the 
end of the term.  The lessee is now held closely to United by the combined effect of the 10 year term, the requirement that if he 
has work available he must use the machine to full capacity, and by the return charge which can in practice, through the right of 
deduction fund, be reduced to insignificance if he keeps this and other United machines to the end of the periods for which he 
leased them.  p. 340 "
817,," ""Second, when a lessee desires to replace a United machine, United gives him more favorable terms if the replacement is by 
another United machine than if it is by a competitive machine. p. 340 ""Third, United's practice of offering to repair, without separate charges, its leased machines, has had the effect that there are no 
independent service organizations to repair complicated machines. In turn, this has had the effect that the manufacturer of a 
complicated machine must either offer repair service with his machine, or must face the obstacle of marketing his machine to 
customers who know that repair service will be difficult to provide.  p. 340 ""If the matter were res integra, this Court would adopt the first approach, and, as a preliminary step to ruling upon § 2, would 
hold that it is a restraint of trade under § 1 for a company having an overwhelming share of the market, to distribute its more 
important products only by leases which have provisions that go beyond assuring prompt, periodic payments of rentals, which 
are not terminable cheaply, which involve discrimination against competition, and which combine in one contract the right to use 
the product and to have it serviced.  p. 343 "" . . . In the relatively static shoe machinery market where there are no sudden changes in the style of machines or in the volume 
of demand, United has a network of long-term, complicated leases with over 90% of the shoe factories. These leases assure 
closer and more frequent contacts between United and its customers than would exist if United were a seller and its customers 
were buyers.  Beyond this general quality, these leases are so drawn and so applied as to strengthen United's power to exclude 
competitors. . . . p. 343 "" . . . These considerations would all affect potential competition, and have not been without their effect on actual competition.  p. 
344 ""Much of United's market power is traceable to the magnetic ties inherent in its system of leasing, and not selling, its more 
important machines. The lease-only system of distributing complicated machines has many 'partnership' aspects, and it has 
exclusionary features such as the 10-year term, the full capacity clause, the return charges, and the failure to segregate service 
charges from machine charges.  Moreover, the leasing system has aided United in maintaining a pricing system which 
discriminates between machine types.  p. 344 "" . . . the leasing system and the miscellaneous activities just referred to . . . are contracts, arrangements, and policies which, 
instead of encouraging competition based on pure merit, further the dominance of a particular firm.  In this sense, they are 
unnatural barriers; they unnecessarily exclude actual and potential competition; they restrict a free market. . . . pp. 344-5 "" . . . United is denied the right to exercise effective control of the market by business policies that are not the inevitable 
consequences of its capacities or its natural advantages.  That those policies are not immoral is irrelevent. . . . p. 345 "" . . . Defendant intended to engage in the leasing practices and pricing policies which maintained its market power.  That is all 
the intent which the law requires when both the complaint and the judgment rest on a charge of 'monopolizing ', not merely 
'attempting to monopolize '. Defendant having willed the means, has willed the end. . . . p. 346 "" . . . All that this opinion has ruled is that when control of the market has been obtained in large part by such leases, the market 
power cannot be said to have been thrust upon its holder through its own skill, energy, and initiative, or through technological 
conditions of production and distribution, or the inevitable characteristics of the market. . . ."" p. 346"
817,4," ""From the opinion on defendant's violations it follows that some form of relief regarding defendant's leases and leasing 
practices is proper and necessary.  p. 348 "
818,," "" . . . the Court agrees with the Government that the leases should be purged of their restrictive features.  In the decree filed 
herewith, the term of the lease is shortened, the full capacity clause is eliminated, the discriminatory commutative charges are 
removed, and United is required to segregate its charges for machines from its charges for repair service. . . . p. 349 ""The Court also agrees with the Government that if United chooses to continue to lease any machine type, it must offer that type 
of machine also for sale.  The principal merit of this proposal does not lie in its primary impact, that is, in its effect in widening the 
choices open to owners of shoe factories. For present purposes it may be assumed that the antitrust laws are not designed, 
chiefly, if at all, to give a customer choice as to the selling methods by which his supplier offers that supplier's own products.  
The merit of the Government's proposal is in its secondary impact.  Insofar as United's machines are sold rather than leased, 
they will ultimately, in many cases, reach a second-hand market.  From that market, United will face a type of substitute 
competition which will gradually weaken the prohibited market power which it now exercises.  Moreover, from that market, or 
from United itself, a competitor of United can acquire a United machine in order to study it, to copy its unpatented features, and 
to experiment with improvements in, or alterations of, the machine. Thus, in another and more direct way, United's market power 
will be diminished.  p. 349 ""Furthermore, the creation of a sales market together with the purging of the restrictive features of the leases will, in 
combination, gradually diminish the magnetic hold now exercised by what United properly describes as the partnership features 
of the leasing system.  As United's relationships with its customers grow feebler, competitors will have an enhanced opportunity 
to market their wares.  p. 350 "" . . . It has used its leases to monopolize the shoe machinery market.  And if leasing continues without an alternative sales 
system, United will still be able to monopolize that market. To root out monopolization and to bring United, in the future, in the 
same class as its competitors, it is necessary not merely to place limitations upon United's leases, but also to require United to 
offer for sale any machine type which it leases. . . ."" p. 350"
818,5," ""The Court: If I have understood your answer correctly, you said that the full capacity clause operates as a deterrent to a 
factory taking on a competitor's machine, and it is a deterrent which the factory owner is not always aware of when he signs the 
lease. Have I misinterpreted your answer? ""The Witness: No, I think that is quite true.  Very often they are not fully aware of the full capacity clause, or the way in which the 
obligation would devolve upon them. ""Q. Well, what I want to make clear is that even in the case where you have done that, have you told him that he couldn't return 
your machine. A.  No, sir.  On the contrary, we have gone to great lengths in most instances, and our branches I believe do so in 
all cases, because he has three alternatives, of course.  He may return the machine if he wishes to, upon the basis I have 
outlined previously.  If he wants to retain the machine, then we expect him to live up to the full capacity obligation in the lease, 
that is, that he will use the machine to full capacity. ""Q. And that is when he has work for it to do?  A. That is right.  Or if he wishes to use the other machine and not use ours, we 
expect that payment will still be made to us, of course, under the full capacity clause."" (United's Exhibit 107) "
820,6," The Right of Deduction Fund is a plan, not part of the leases, but established by United in written notices to lessees, whereby 
(since 1939) 4 percent of all unit charges, rentals, and minimum charges on a machine is credited to the lessee. The credit is 
solely for the purpose of being applied, if the lessee desires, to deferred (or return) payments, and (since 1939) to payments for 
use less than minimum, due on that machine or other machines in that factory. The credit is not available if the lessee is in 
default on any payment due United, or if the lease has been terminated by reason of the lessee's breach or insolvency."

832,12," Later in 1952, United's Research Department, after reporting on foreign machines of different types and manufacture, 
concluded that: "". . . ""Assuming the fact that most foreign shoe machines will eventually live up to our high standards of quality and production, the 
quantity of major machines of foreign make installed in the U.S. will depend on the efficacy of a suitable maintenance service 
and parts stock. ""Further assuming that the distribution of these machines and their maintenance service would be handled by companies with 
branches in the nation's shoe centers such as I.S.M.C. and Compo Shoe Machinery Corp., the parts supply would, to say the 
least, present a serious problem to their agents.  It would be most costly to import spare parts and stock them in sufficient 
numbers at strategic points, a fact which would reflect in the shoe manufacturers' overhead. ""Should the United States agents of foreign shoe machinery manufacturers decide to produce spare parts for foreign machines 
in this country, the cost of fixtures, jigs, etc. for so many various models of different make would make the capital outlay seem 
prohibitive in view of the limited market. "" . . . The shoe manufacturer who has acquired foreign machines at a comparatively low purchase price would also be forced to 
invest in a costly spare parts stock and to employ a trained staff of mechanics for the maintenance of these machines in an 
adequately equipped workshop.  This, in our opinion, would tend to offset, if not wipe out, the initial saving derived from the "
833,," purchase of a lower-priced machine and would increase the manufacturing cost of footwear.  The above would be true with all 
major machines such as pulling over, side lasting, outsole stitching, and inseam sewing machines. "". . . ""We, therefore, assume that, while a few major foreign machines may find their way into domestic factories, there is at this time 
not too great a danger of any mass import. . . ."" "

concept of 'economic equivalence' used in the Dean Report - that is, 'a set of lease terms and a sale price so related that it will 
be a matter of indifference to the shoe manufacturer if he acts solely in his economic best interests, whether he elects to lease or 
to buy' and 'an equivalent price is one that makes ownership costs just equal to leasing costs'."" "

877,3," .  It is unlikely that Peterson could show an antitrust violation in the concert area.  His status in this field is relevant to two 
charges: pressuring leaders into the union and fixing minimum prices. Since leading at concerts constitutes only a very small percentage of Peterson's activities and the rest of his business is 
conducted in a manner which justified the pressure to join the union, the fact that Peterson might be a 'non-labor' independent 
contractor in the concert field is immaterial.  The union would still be entitled to attempt to induce or force him to join. Further, if Peterson only organizes the concerts and does not personally conduct or play, as has been his practice since 
expulsion, he has failed to establish that in this capacity pressure was, in fact, exerted on him to join the union.  See V, infra.  If 
Peterson actually conducts at the concerts, then it is likely that he is in job and wage competition with subleaders and a member 
of a labor group.  As such, he would be a proper subject for unionization.  See V, infra. Regarding the charge of minimum price fixing, if Peterson does not conduct or play at concert engagements, this charge would 
be treated the same as it would in the club date or hotel steady field.  See VI, infra.  There would be no antitrust violation.  If 
Peterson does conduct at concert engagements, as stated above, he would probably be a member of a labor group and a 
proper subject for union regulation. "

912,8," The Chicago Title is the second largest title insurance company in the United States.  It, and its subsidiaries, in 1960, had a 
gross income of over $ 22,000,000, and assets of over $ 90,000.000. They write title insurance in some 42 states.  The total 
amount of title insurance written increased from $ 858,600,000 in 1944 to $ 2,684,400,000 in 1952.  Beginning in 1954, Chicago 
Title began an expansion program in Illinois, generally taking over the assets of the acquired company which was dissolved; it 
now has 14 offices in Illinois, and an agency relationship with some 63 independent abstract companies in Illinois, which did 
abstracting exclusively for it, out of a total of 67 independent abstrators in Illinois.  It wrote over 95% Of the total of $ 15,000,000 
title insurance in Illinois in 1960, 17% Of which was on orders from outside Illinois. It issued, in 1959, 479 reinsurance policies 
with a coverage of approximately $ 173,000,000 to 29 title companies located in 19 states and in the District of Columbia.  The 
amount of its title insurance business with out-of-state customers is steadily increasing, and has directed its efforts for business 
on a national scale.  In 1957, it began to expand out of state.  Prior to 1957, it acquired an Indiana title company's outstanding 
stock, and the outstanding stock of the Title Insurance Corporation of St. Louis, a Missouri company; in March, 1960, it acquired 
all the capital stock of the Title Guaranty Company of Wisconsin, a Wisconsin company; in November, 1960, it acquired over 
90% Of the stock of Home Title Guaranty Company of New York, a New York company.  The St. Louis Title, in 1957, had assets 
of over $ 2,000,000, and agency arrangements with some 45 independent abstract companies; it did approximately 20% Of the 
Missouri title business; it was licensed to issue policies in some 11 states other than Missouri, including Alabama, Arkansas, 
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, and Oklahoma.  Wisconsin Title, in 1960, also had 
assets of over $ 2,000,000, and an annual income of over $ 1,000,000; it had agency relationship with some 28 independent 
abstract companies in Wisconsin; in 1960, Wisconsin Title wrote title insurances on which $ 600,000 out of $ 1,100,000 paid in 
Wisconsin were paid to it, and it had over 50% Of the title business in Wisconsin when acquired by Chicago Title."

916,14," '* * * There is nothing in the conference report that relieves insurance companies from the prohibition of the antitrust law, 
because there has been written back into the bill language which was taken out by the House which would have exempted 
agreements from the prohibition of the antitrust law.  Therefore any attempt by a small group of insurance companies to enter 
into an agreement by which they would penalize any person or any business which was attempting to do business in the 
insurance field in a way that was disapproved by them, would be absolutely prohibited by this provision. 'MR. PEPPER. * * * I am confident that the courts would hold that if they tried to legitimize a private agreement which per se 
violated the Sherman Act or the Clayton Act, that that would not be called regulation so as to protect them from prosecution.' (P. 
1480) 'MR. FERGUSON.  Under the language which is now in the bill as it appears in the conference report, if a State passes an act 
regulating insurance or taxing insurance, that that regulation is contrary to the Sherman Act or the Clayton Act, with three 
exceptions, then the State law would be the law. * * * If the states were specifically to legislate upon a particular point, and that 
legislation were contrary to the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act * * * then the State law would be binding.  That is exactly what we 
attempted to do in the bill.  It is clear what we intended to do. * * * 'MR. PEPPER.  In other words, the Senator (Ferguson) believes in a form of rate fixing? 'MR. FERGUSON.  Yes. * * * We believe that all the wisdom is not here in Congress.' (P. 1481) 'MR. PEPPER. * * * The Senate has heard the able Senator from Michigan say that regulation by State law may mean any 
degree of encroachment upon the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act which a legislature may desire to exercise. * * * 'MR. PEPPER.  That is the reason why I am not willing to give the States the power pro tanto to repeal or invalidate either one of 
those acts, and that is what the language to which I am addressing myself would permit them to do. * * * 'Under the language of the conference report to which I have adverted, after the 3-year moratorium period, * * * they can curtail 
by State legislation the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act to any degree that they desire to do so. * * *' (Pp. 1482-3) 'MR. O'MAHONEY.  Mr. President, there is not a line or sentence in the proposed act as I have read it, which would delegate to 
any State the power to legislate in the field of interstate and foreign commerce.  State regulation must be for the State and not 
for the United States.  The bill does not sacrifice the power of Congress to regulate in the field of interstate commerce, but 
wisely, it seems to me, undertakes to say in effect to the State, 'For this period take the responsibility and regulate insurance in 
the interest of the public,"" (P. 1483) 'MR. PEPPER. * * * What are we faced with here today? A carte blanche authority at this late date * * *; we are now confronted 
with the language of this conference report which for the first time gives the States carte blanche to legitimatize the very vices 
against which the Clayton Act and the Sherman Act were directed, to which acts the insurance companies at last have been 
made amenable by the decision of the United States Supreme Court. 'MR. MURDOCK.  If they do something objectionable * * * then the Congress reserves the right to strike it down * * * we could 
make both the Clayton Act and the Sherman Act applicable in their full vigor against anything the States might do.' (P. 1484) 'MR. O'MAHONEY. * * * I do not conceive this to be a grant of power to the States to authorize by permissive legislation 
obviously adverse combinations which would be against the public interest. 'MR. PEPPER.  Am I correct in saying that under the proviso * * * if a State made it an offense, under the laws of the State, to 
engage in combinations in restraint of trade, the Sherman Antitrust Act could not apply to combinations and restraints of trade by 
companies engaged in business in that State? Is not that what it means? 'MR. O'MAHONEY.  No. * * * 'MR. MURDOCK. * * * Insofar as they fail to cover the same ground covered by the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act, those acts 
become effective again. 'MR. BARKLEY.  I should like to ask * * * whether, where States attempt to occupy the field --  but do it inadequately --  by going 
through the form of legislation so as to deprive the Clayton Act, the Sherman Act, and the other acts of their jurisdiction, it is the "
917,," Senator's interpretation of the conference report that in a case of that kind, where the legislature fails adequately even to deal 
with the field it attempts to cover, these acts still would apply? 'MR. McCARRAN.  That is my interpretation. 'MR. PEPPER.  I do not oppose State regulation which is not inconsistent with the operation of the Sherman Antitrust Act and 
the Clayton Act. On matters of taxation, general regulation, and all that sort of thing, I think the States should regulate, but I think 
that now that insurance has been brought by the decision of the Supreme Court up to the bar of the Clayton Act and the 
Sherman Act, we should not give the insurance companies immunity from the applicability of those acts.' (P. 1444) 'MR. PEPPER. * * * Will the Senator tell the Senate if I am not correct in saying that under the conference report provision to 
which I referred the States can regulate the business of insurance in any way inconsistent with the Sherman Act and the Clayton 
Act. 'MR. McCARRAN.  If they do it, they do it as their own hazard . . ..' 'Congress has always the power over interstate commerce. * * * 'The States cannot take the Congress out of a position where it can regulate interstate commerce.' (P. 1478). (Italics supplied.)"
917,15," He cited Connecticut General Life Insurance Company v. Johnson, 303 U.S. 77, 58 S.Ct. 436, 82 L.Ed. 673 (1937), which 
held that a state could not because of the XIV Amendment, tax a Connecticut corporation which did reinsurance business in 
California, where the tax was measured by the gross premiums received.  The court said, at 82, 58 S.Ct. at 439: 'The grant by 
the state of the privilege of doing business there and its consequent authority to tax the privilege do not withdraw from the 
protection of the due process clause the privilege, which California does not grant, of doing business elsewhere.' The second case, St. Louis Cotton Compress Company v. State of Arkansas, 260 U.S. 346, 43 S.Ct. 125, 67 L.Ed. 297, held a 
state law exacting of persons insuring their property situate in the state a so-called tax of five per cent of the amounts paid by 
them as premiums to insurers not authorized to do business in the state, is void as applied to insurance contracted and paid for 
outside the state by a foreign corporation doing local business.  The court said, at 349, 43 S.Ct. at 125: 'It is true that the State 
may regulate the activities of foreign corporations within the State but it cannot regulate or interfere with what they do outside.' The third case is Allgeyer v. Louisiana, 165 U.S. 578, 17 S.Ct. 427, 41 L.Ed. 832 (1897), where it was held a Louisiana statute 
was in violation of the Constitution of the United States which provided that any firm which in any manner whatever does an act 
in that state to effect, for himself or for another, insurance on property then in that state, in any marine insurance company which 
has not complied in all respects with the laws of the state, shall be subject to a fine when applied to a contract of insurance 
made in the State of New York, with an insurance company of that state, where the premiums were paid, and where the losses 
were to be paid, is a violation of the Constitution of the United States.  At 591, 17 S.Ct. at 432, the court said: 'Such a statute as 
this in question is not due process of law, because it prohibits an act which under the federal constitution the defendants had a 
right to perform.  This does not interfere in any way with the acknowledged right of the state to enact such legislation in the 
legitimate exercise of its police or other powers as to it may seem proper.  In the exercise of such right, however, care must be 
taken not to infringe upon those other rights of the citizen which are protected by the federal constitution.' "

] In distinguishing bailments from sales, the test of a bailment is that the identical thing is to be returned in the same or 
in some altered form; if another thing of equal value is to be returned, the transaction is a sale.  Black's Law Dictionary 185 (3d 
ed. 1933). Since we have concluded that the supplemental agreement involved a sale, we do not reach the question of whether 
Simpson applies the per se rule against price fixing only to those consignment agreements involving a sufficient number of

973,1," Section 5 provides in pertinent part: (a)(1) Unfair methods of competition in commerce, and unfair . . . acts or practices in commerce, are declared unlawful."
973,*," * * (6) The Commission is empowered and directed to prevent persons, partnerships, or corporations . . . from using unfair 
methods of competition in commerce and unfair . . . acts or practices in commerce. (b) Whenever the Commission shall have reason to believe that any such person, partnership, or corporation has been or is 
using any unfair method of competition or unfair . . . act or practice in commerce, and if it shall appear to the Commission 
that a proceeding by it in respect thereof would be to the interest of the public, it shall issue and serve upon such person, 
partnership, or corporation a complaint stating its charges in that respect and containing a notice of a hearing upon a day 
and at a place therein fixed at least thirty days after the service of said complaint. . . .  If upon such hearing the Commission 
shall be of the opinion that the method of competition or the act or practice in question is prohibited by [this Act], it shall 
make a report in writing in which it shall state its findings as to the facts and shall issue and cause to be served on such "
974,," person, partnership, or corporation an order requiring such person, partnership, or corporation to cease and desist from 
using such method of competition or such act or practice. . . .  After the expiration of the time allowed for filing a petition for 
review, if no such petition has been duly filed within such time, the Commission may at any time, after notice and 
opportunity for hearing, reopen and alter, modify, or set aside, in whole or in part, any report or order made or issued by it 
under this section, whenever in the opinion of the Commission conditions of fact or of law have so changed as to require 
such action or if the public interest shall so require. . . ."
974,2," The examiner's proposed order would have applied to all products sold by Sun.  Upon Sun's challenge to the scope of the 
order, the Commission limited it to gasoline. Also at the request of Sun, the Commission modified the order to except contracts 
entered into in conformity with the McGuire Act amendment of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 66 Stat. 632, 15 
U.S.C. § 45(a)(2)-(5)."
974,3," Sun's appeal was heard by a full complement of the Commission.  Commissioner Anderson concurred in the result, believing 
that the opinion of the Commission should have given assurance that it was not attacking the general practice of consignment 
selling."
974,4, Sun was ordered to cease and desist from:
974,1," .  Entering into, continuing, cooperating in, or carrying out any planned common course of action, understanding, 
arrangement, agreement, contract or conspiracy with any person or persons not parties hereto, to establish, fix, adopt, 
maintain, adhere to, or stabilize by any means or method, prices, terms or conditions of sale at which its gasoline is to be 
sold."
974,2," .  Establishing, maintaining, continuing, cooperating in, or carrying out, or attempting so to do, any plan, policy, program, 
or any consignment policy in combination with any other person or persons not parties hereto, for the purpose or with the 
effect of enabling respondent to establish or fix the prices, terms or conditions of sale at which its gasoline is to be resold by 
a dealer after purchase from respondent. Provided, However, that nothing herein contained shall be construed to limit or otherwise affect any resale price 
maintenance contracts which respondent may enter into in conformity with Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 
as amended by the McGuire Act (Public Law 542, 82nd Cong., 2nd Session, approved July 14, 1952). "
975,5," The states are in the general area east of Chicago.  They include the New England and Middle Atlantic States, and Ohio, 
Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Florida and West Virginia.  Sun markets only to a minor degree in South Carolina and Georgia."
975,6," Taylor's share of the market was approximately 7.4% in 1951, 6.5% in 1952, 7.0% in 1953, and 6.0% in September, 1954."
975,7," Taylor had 34 stations in July, 1954.  In early 1955 Sun had 12-14 stations, but gradually increased the number to 29 by 
October, 1956."
975,8," In July, 1954, Taylor's 34 stations were averaging 21,272 gallons per month per station. In early 1955 Sun averaged 20,000 
per month per station. However, as it increased the number of stations, the gallonage per station decreased. In 1955, Sun accounted for only about 2.65% of the market.  It advanced to 3.85% by 1956. "
976,9," Such contractual arrangements have been noted here to illustrate the nature of the pre-existing relationship between Sun and 
its dealers. This relationship, in great part, led the hearing examiner to note that the bargaining between Sun and the dealers 
concerning consignment was conducted hardly as equals.  However, the record in this case gives no indication, and the 
Commission did not find, that Sun ever used or explicitly threatened to use, with regard to its consignment agreements, its 
inherent power over Sun dealers through the quarterly amendments to the basic lease rentals and the contractual requirement to 
purchase a specified minimum amount of gasoline. For an important case involving this form of coercion, which is discussed 
below at some length, see Simpson v. Union Oil Company of California, 377 U.S. 13, 12 L. Ed. 2d 98, 84 S. Ct. 1051 (1964)."
976,10," Except for the price disturbance on upper Hampton Boulevard, the prevailing major price in the Norfolk area was 30.9 cents, 
the prices at the military exchanges were 25.9 cents in Norfolk and 26.9 cents in Portsmouth, and the prevailing private-brand 
price was 28.9 cents.  Although the price disturbance was limited to upper Hampton Boulevard, and had little if any effect on any 
of the Sun stations other than the one in that neighborhood, the nearest being approximately three miles away while the Sun 
stations in Virginia Beach were over 20 miles away, Sun advised the dealers that it intended to adopt the consignment plan 
throughout the entire Norfolk area and reduce the price to 27.9 cents, that posted by the other majors on upper Hampton 
Boulevard. The hearing examiner found that Sun's area-wide reduction necessarily had the effect of spreading the price war throughout the 
entire area.  Within a few days of the Sun reduction, the other major dealers met Sun's price and the private-brand operators 
reduced their prevailing price to 25.9 cents, attempting to restore the 2-cent differential.  Prices continued to decline for several 
months.  Each time that Sun and the other majors reduced their prices, the private brands in general posted a price two cents 
lower.  However, in the latter part of March, 1957, the private brands apparently gave up the fight and posted one cent below 
Sun's prevailing prices.  Shortly thereafter, in April, the prices at most Sun stations returned to the pre-price-war level of 30.9, 
and the private brands posted a price of 29.9. "
977,11," The proposed consignment agreement constituted a written amendment to the sales agreement.  By its terms it purported to 
retain title to the gasoline in Sun, provided for deliveries of gasoline to the dealer upon consignment as an agent, Sun fixed the 
prices at which the gasoline was to be sold, and until August of 1957 the amendment contained a specified minimum 
commission after which time the minimum commission fee was to be set at the discretion of Sun.  Sun purchased the gasoline 
already in the dealers' tanks.  The gasoline in the tanks was measured each time the posted price was changed by Sun, and the 
dealers were required to account for that sold at the previous price. Under this arrangement, the dealer was to act as a commission agent in the sale of gasoline although he remained an 
independent dealer in the sale of all other products and services.  The dealers were required to segregate the funds from the 
sale of gasoline, but in fact never did so.  All risk of loss or shortage was on the dealer. Collateral deposit agreements which the 
dealers previously had entered into as independent contractors to secure the payment of certain indebtedness were amended 
also to secure Sun for the payment of the consigned gasoline. The consignment agreements were terminable on five days' 
notice except for defaults which made them terminable upon 24 hours' notice."
977,12," Inasmuch as Williams was the only hold-out from Sun's offer of commission consignment, his experience and testimony was 
considered peculiarly important with regard to the question of the voluntariness of the dealers' acceptance of the plan.  Actually, 
however, the testimony of Williams at the hearing shed little light on this issue.  At one point he stated that he did not initially go 
on consignment because of a misunderstanding of certain details of the plan.  Williams owned his own station and apparently 
was under the impression that, if he accepted consignment, his property would be subject to certain ""holds or attachment(s)"" by 
Sun.  When finally informed that this impression was incorrect, he went on consignment. On the other hand, when asked 
whether he felt he had any choice when he eventually went on consignment in February, 1957, Williams stated he did not.  Later 
he testified that he felt the owner of a business had the ""privilege of putting the price"", and then added that ""when you put a price 
you certainly have to be in competition and if you can't beat them you have to join them."" "
978,13," The courts have construed the Federal Trade Commission Act as being in pari materia with the Sherman and Clayton Acts, 
Menzies v. Federal Trade Commission, 242 F.2d 81 (4th Cir. 1957), cert. den.  353 U.S. 957, 1 L. Ed. 2d 908, 77 S. Ct. 863 
(1957), and have allowed the use of cases decided under any of the antitrust laws in dealing with cases brought by the 
Commission.  Federal Trade Commission v. Beech-Nut Packing, 257 U.S. 441, 453, 66 L. Ed. 307, 42 S. Ct. 150 (1922); 
Federal Trade Commission v. Motion Picture Adv. Service Co., 344 U.S. 392, 394-395, 73 S. Ct. 361, 97 L. Ed. 426 (1953). 
Thus it is that violations of the Sherman Act have been held to constitute violations of Section 5 of the Federal Trade 
Commission Act. Federal Trade Commission v. Cement Institute, 333 U.S. 683, 690, 92 L. Ed. 1010, 68 S. Ct. 793 (1948); 
National Macaroni Manufacturers Association v. Federal Trade Commission, 345 F.2d 421, 427 (7th Cir. 1965). "
979,14," The evidence taken by the hearing examiner was that, at the meetings of November 5, 1956, and after the consignment plan 
had been explained and offered to the dealers by Southard, there was a general discussion among the dealers themselves as to 
the pros and cons of the proposition.  Conversations among the dealers took place both in and out of Southard's presence.  Of 
particular import to the dealers was whether they should stay within one cent of the independents -- also discussed at this time -- 
for it was clear, as the Commission found, that the extent to which such a uniform reduction was to be maintained, ""cooperation 
and participation by all was necessary."" At the conclusion of the discussions, all dealers present signed consignment 
agreements.  On the afternoon of the day the contracts were signed, Sun prices (with three exceptions) were dropped three 
cents to 27.9 cents per gallon, the proffered price.  Thus supported was the finding of the Commission that ""there was an 
interdependence in the dealers' decisions to participate in respondent's consignment plan"" amounting to a horizontal price fixing 
device in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act."
979,15," The terms ""vertical price fixing"" and ""resale price maintenance"" are often used interchangeably.  Resale price maintenance 
has been defined as ""'pricing through agreements or conspiracies between two or more persons operating at different levels of 
the same production-distribution-consumption process.'"" Kronstein, Modern American Antitrust Law 145 n. 1 (1958), quoting 
from Kronstein & Miller, Regulation of Trade 850 (1953).  The terms are used interchangeably in the course of this opinion."
979,16," Inasmuch as the General Electric case was concerned solely with a patented product, the language ""patented or otherwise"" is 
clearly dictum.  However, because of such dicta in General Electric, it has been thought by many that the consignment device for 
resale price maintenance was not inconsistent with the antitrust laws no matter how large the system involved and regardless of 
the non-existence of a patented product.  Thus it is that ""resale price maintenance of gasoline through the 'consignment' device "
980,," is increasing."" Simpson v. Union Oil Company of California, 377 U.S. 13, 19, 12 L. Ed. 2d 98, 84 S. Ct. 1051 (1964), citing H. R. 
Rep. No. 1157, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 6-7."
980,17," The fact that Masonite involved competitors rather than vertical customers, as was the case here, is not a factor upon which 
that case can be distinguished.  The Supreme Court has stated clearly that the elimination of competition among retail distributor 
purchasers by price fixing is illegal per se, just as is such price fixing among competitors. United States v. Paramount Pictures, 
Inc., 334 U.S. 131, 92 L. Ed. 1260, 68 S. Ct. 915 (1948); Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co., 220 U.S. 373, 55 L. 
Ed. 502, 31 S. Ct. 376 (1911); United States v. Bausch & Lomb Optical Co., 321 U.S. 707, 88 L. Ed. 1024, 64 S. Ct. 805 (1944). 
The rule is applicable here where Sun retail dealers were, to greater or lesser degree, in competition with each other.  Cf., 
Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, 340 U.S. 211, 215, 95 L. Ed. 219, 71 S. Ct. 259 (1951)."
980,18," In holding Sun's consignment plan unlawful, the Commission did not find that ""it did not constitute a genuine consignment 
under the law of agency."" Supra, text at note 3.  Yet there were aspects of the relationship between Sun and its dealers after 
consignment was put into effect that did not conform to the purported agency.  For example, a portion of the rental paid to Sun 
by dealers who leased station premises was for the storage of gasoline on said premises.  This portion of the lease agreements 
was never amended, even though after consignment title to the gasoline did not pass to the dealers. Thus, after consignment, 
the dealers continued to pay rent for the storage of gasoline, gasoline which was not theirs.  Secondly, the dealers continued to 
hold themselves out as ""proprietors"", not as agents of Sun, after going on consignment, again in accordance with the 
unamended pre-consignment lease agreements.  And finally, under local law the dealers were required to pay a retail 
merchants' license to sell gasoline. After the adoption of commission consignment, they continued to pay this license or tax until 
1958, when Sun began to pay it after the tax officials called it to Sun's attention.  Sun now contends this was the result of mere 
oversight.  However, Sun did not go so far as to refund the license payments theretofore made by the dealers. "
981,19," The essential facts in Simpson are as follows: In conjunction with renewable one-year leases on its retail outlets, Union Oil 
entered into consignment agreements with its lessee dealers, under which it controlled the retail price and retained title to and 
paid all property taxes on the consigned gasoline until it was sold.  The dealer, on the other hand, received a guaranteed 
commission from Union, was obliged to carry personal liability and property damage insurance, was responsible for any ordinary 
losses of consigned gasoline, and paid his own costs of operation.  Two months before his lease expired, Simpson, Union's 
dealer-lessee, lowered his price on regular gasoline two cents below Union's authorized price.  Union then refused to renew the 
lease and the agreement expired, Union resuming possession of the premises.  Thereafter, Simpson brought suit for damages 
under § 4 of the Clayton Act for violation of §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The district court granted Union's motion for 
summary judgment, the Court of Appeals affirmed, and the Supreme Court reversed."
981,20," The view of Mr. Justice Douglas that the existence of a patented product constituted the ""ratio decidendi"" of General Electric 
has been severely criticized.  See, e.g., Simpson v. Union Oil Company of California, 377 U.S. at 25 (dissenting opinion of Mr. 
Justice STEWART); Lyons v. Westinghouse Electric Corporation, 235 F. Supp. 526, 535 n. 1 (S.D.N.Y. 1964); Handler, 
Seventeenth Annual Review of Antitrust Developments -- 1964, 19 Record of N.Y.C.B.A. 379 (1964); Handler, Recent Antitrust 
Developments -- 1964, 63 Mich. L. Rev. 59, 60 (1964). Nevertheless, it seems clear that General Electric could be limited to its 
special facts and need not be overruled for the reason that all references therein to non-patented products were dicta.  See note 
16, supra."
981,21," ""Whether . . . (Simpson) . . . amounts to overruling General Electric or merely limiting it is a matter of semantics.  The practical 
effect is the same, whichever word one uses.  I cannot escape the conclusion that where no controlling patents are present, the 
rule laid down in General Electric, at least for the future, is no longer law."" Lyons v. Westinghouse Electric Corporation, 235 F. 
Supp. 526, 535 (S.D.N.Y. 1964)."
981,22," See C.B.S. Business Equipment Corp. v. Underwood Corporation, 240 F. Supp. 413, 425 (S.D.N.Y. 1964), for a similar

present in the Commission's opinion."
982,25," This is particularly striking in view of the findings of the hearing examiner. Supra, text at note 9 and text preceding note 11.  It 
is also noteworthy that the Commission's opinion in Atlantic Refining was handed down on May 16, 1963, just a day after it 
handed down its opinion in this case. "

accept, anything of value as a commission, brokerage, or other compensation, or any allowance or discount in lieu thereof, 
except for services rendered in connection with the sale or purchase of goods, wares, or merchandise, either to the other

the disadvantage of the other; he may not use the privilege of interstate commerce to the injury of his local trade, nor may 
he favor his local trade to the injury of his interstate trade.  The Federal power to regulate interstate commerce is the power 
both to limit its employment to the injury of business within the State, and to protect interstate commerce itself from injury by 
influences within the State.'"" 348 U.S. at 120."

contracts for services.  The proportion supplied by the State of the ingredients of the final product delivered was relatively 
insignificant, and this was done for the purpose of circumventing the State Purchasing Agent and of attempting to give to a 
purchase transaction the appearance of a contract for services."" "

1000,," New York 19, New York Dear Miss Davies: Your letter of April 7, 1955, directed to the attention of Paul A. Taylor, as well as the correspondence between you and Mr. 
Taylor relative to your research findings, marketing and patent process material for Carnation Instant, has been turned over to 
the undersigned.  After studying the resume of your experience in the food industry, we can safely assume that you are aware of 
the dangers involved in giving consideration to unpatented and uncopyrighted ideas and suggestions which are submitted for our 
consideration and which are unsolicited by us.  Because of this, we have been forced to adopt a policy that we will not consider 
any suggestion or idea of this type unless the person wishing to submit the idea or suggestion first signs a release form of the 
type submitted to you by Mr. Taylor.  We also will not agree to pay any specified sum in advance for any suggestion submitted. We realize, of course, that a program of this type undoubtedly causes many people to refuse to submit their idea or suggestion 
to us for our consideration.  While we sincerely regret this, we have been forced, because of legal considerations to adopt this 
rather harsh procedure.  As I believe Mr. Taylor pointed out to you, we would be most happy to give consideration to your 
findings but only upon the conditions expressed in the release.  We will not and cannot agree to pay any advance in the sum of 
$3500.00 if we find your research findings to be of use to us.  I might add that Carnation Company has always compensated 
people for any suggestion submitted which was new to the company and which was of value to the company.  The amount of 
compensation, however, as expressed in our release, rests solely in our discretion and would naturally be based upon the value 
of the idea or suggestion which was submitted. We have no objection to your taking this matter up further with Mr. Peebles.  We 
might add, however, that Mr. Peebles always refers matters of this type to this department. Very truly yours, Corporate Department RDKummel: jph cc -- P. A. Taylor"" "

1014,1," ""Each defendant is perpetually enjoined and restrained from directly or indirectly or in any manner adopting, advertising, 
participating in, adhering to, applying or enforcing any by-law, rule, regulation, agreement, contract, understanding, practice, 
procedure or arrangement of any kind or nature whatsoever which has the purpose or effect, directly or indirectly, of requiring as 
a condition of eligibility to participate in or to receive a prize or award in any bowling tournament, bowling contest, bowling 
program or bowling activity that a bowler must bowl all of his or her league play or other bowling activities in establishments 
which are members of BPAA, Northern Association, Santa Clara Association, or any other bowling proprietors' association."" "
1015,2," Sixty-five per cent of all leagues are formed by trade, professional or fraternal groups; the remainder by bowling establishments 
for revenue-producing purposes."
1015,3," The contract specifies the price to be paid for the league's bowling, the period of time during which the league undertakes to 
bowl, and the hour and location of its bowling with the establishment. The individual bowler is under an obligation to bowl the 
complete season for which the contract is made.  He can withdraw from the league only if he provides a replacement bowler. 
Failure to provide a replacement subjects him to possible suspension from membership in the bowlers' associations."
1015,4, The winter season of 30-33 weeks lasts from September through May; the summer season of 12 weeks from May until August.
1015,5," In 1959, Norcal approved 30 such tournaments; in 1962, 48; during the first 8 months of 1963, 34."
1015,6," As a league season consists of about 100 games, usually three games per week in each of the 30-33 weeks of the season, 
there are obvious practical limitations in the number of leagues any one bowler can participate in.  A national survey made by 
ABC in 1956-57, indicated that 89 per cent of its then 2.5 million members bowled in only one league. "
1016,7," Defendants erroneously characterize the issue as one of fact, i.e., the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the court's findings 
and conclusions about the modified eligibility rule.  Since defendants have abandoned their appeal, the sufficiency of the 
evidence is not in issue and must be presumed."
1016,8," Cases based on the Clayton Act, however, are not applicable since that act is broader in its scope and prohibitions ( Rolley, 
Inc. v. Merle Norman Cosmetics, Inc., 129 Cal.App.2d 844 [278 P.2d 63, 282 P.2d 991]). "
1017,9," Although Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States (1951) 341 U.S. 593 [71 S.Ct. 971, 95 L.Ed. 1199], and White Motor Co. 
v. United States (1963) 372 U.S. 253 [83 S.Ct. 696, 9 L.Ed.2d 738], indicate that only certain tying arrangements are in the per 
se category, the court indicated in the Northern Pac. case, at page 6, that tying agreements ""are unreasonable in and of 
themselves whenever a party has sufficient economic power with respect to the tying product to appreciably restrain free 
competition in the market for the tied product and a 'not insubstantial' amount of interstate commerce is affected."" CA(2)[

1019,10," As the parties agree that there are approximately 190,000 men and women league bowlers in northern California, about 
152,000 bowl in only one league; 38,000 in more than one league; the number interested in local or regional tournaments is 
47,000; the great majority of the 47,000 interested in local or regional tournaments are to be found in the 38,000 who bowl in 
more than one league. "

also not controlling here for they involved (a) the admitted receipt of brokerage payments by buyers' agents and raised issues 
concerning whether the buyers actually controlled the recipients of the payments or whether the payments were justifiably 
granted ""for services rendered"" the seller, see Modern Marketing Service Inc. v. FTC, 149 F.2d 970 (7th Cir. 1945); Webb-

1028,2," This decision and its progeny have not only been criticized for adopting an inflexible construction of Section 2(c), see Rowe, 
Price Discrimination Under the Robinson-Patman Act 357-59 (1962); Austin, Price Discrimination and Related Problems Under 
the Robinson-Patman Act 114-16 (1959); Law, The Performance of Distribution Functions as Legal Justification for Price 
Differentials Under the Robinson-Patman Act, 69 Dick. L. Rev. 39 (1964), but also for adopting a construction which is "
1029,," inconsistent with broader antitrust principles in that it granted a legal monopoly to one type of middleman, clogged competition in 
distribution channels and exacted a tribute ""from the consumer for the benefit of a special class."" Atty. Gen. Nat'l Comm. 
Antitrust Rep. 191-93 (1955); Edwards, supra at 151."
1029,3," The ""for services rendered"" proviso in § 2(c) could have been invoked to dispose of this appeal for FTC v. Henry Broch & Co., 
363 U.S. 166, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1124, 80 S. Ct. 1158 (1960) ""indicated sympathy with some reassessment of the 'for services 
rendered' clause,"" Rowe, supra 353 (1962), which many considered a dead letter in view of Southgate Brokerage Co. v. FTC, 
150 F.2d 607 (4th Cir. 1945), see Rowe, supra at 350 (1962); Austern, Section 2(c), CCH Robinson-Patman Act Symposium 37 
(1946).  The discounts here, moreover, could properly be treated as granted ""for services rendered"" to American.  That avenue 
of analysis, however, has been rejected because it is too circuitous and prevents the inquiry from focusing on the ultimate issue, 
viz., at what point should § 2(a), the general price discrimination provision, yield to § 2(c), the brokerage provision?  This issue 
should be resolved by restricting the operation of § 2(c) to those payments demonstrated to be causally related to either partial 
or total elimination of brokerage services, with the caveat that legitimate variations in brokerage fees, i.e., those based on 
genuine differences in cost, may be passed on in the form of lower prices.  Thomasville Chair Co. v. FTC, 306 F.2d 541 (5th Cir. 
1962); cf.  FTC v. Broch & Co., supra. This rule embodies a frank recognition of the legitimate economic function performed by 
intermediate distributors and the need for fostering competition in the channels of distribution which is best served by testing 
discounts under the less restrictive standards of § 2(a). "
1039,1," During October 1962 the Antitrust Division of the United States Justice Department, pursuant to regular liaison procedure, 
notified the FTC of the pending grand jury investigation. On July 30, 1963 the Chairman of the Commission at its request sent a 
copy of the 1959 order to the Attorney General and requested him to ""initiate appropriate proceedings under Section 16 of the 
Federal Trade Commission Act . . . looking to the recovery of civil penalties should your examination of the results of the . . . 
investigation indicate a violation of the Commission's order."""
1039,2," § 5 (l) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45 (l) provides in pertinent part that: Any person, partnership, or corporation who violates an order of the Commission to cease and desist after it has become 
final, and while such order is in effect, shall forfeit and pay to the United States a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 for 
each violation, which shall accrue to the United States and may be recovered in a civil action brought by the United States. Eight other civil penalty suits were simultaneously commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of 
New York against other manufacturers of multiwall paper shipping sacks that had consented to the 1959 cease and desist order. 
The aggregate amount of penalties claimed in all the actions, including this one, is $865,000."
1039,3," § 16 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. § 56 provides that: Whenever the Federal Trade Commission has reason to believe that any person, partnership or corporation is liable to a 
penalty under section 54 of this title or under subsection (l) of section 45 of this title, it shall certify the facts to the Attorney 
General, whose duty it shall be to cause appropriate proceedings to be brought for the enforcement of the provisions of 
such section or subsection. "
1040,4," Appellant does not claim, however, that the Attorney General is a mere ""rubber stamp"" for the Commission but, rather, that 
subsequent to FTC certification, he may exercise his discretion and decline to bring suit.  See Anderson, Settlement and 
Compliance Procedures, 14 ABA Antitrust Section Rep. 60, 65 (1959)."
1040,5," Moreover, while § 5 (l) was briefly mentioned in the report of the House committee which added § 16 to the FTCA and in the 
report of the conference committee on the amendment as finally passed, neither report mentioned § 16.  See H.R.Rep. No. 
1613, 75 Cong., 1st Sess. 4 (1937); H.R.Rept. No. 1774, 75th Cong., 3d Sess. 9-11 (1938).  Also, the records of the FTC which 
strongly supported the amendment are silent with respect to the intended relationship between § 5 (l) and § 16.  Finally, the 
legislative history of the finality and civil penalty provisions added to the Clayton Act in 1959, 15 U.S.C. § 21(g), (1), which were 
patterned after the FTCA, contains little discussion of the civil penalty method of enforcing Commission orders and contains no 
explanation of the failure to include in the Clayton Act a certification provision similar to § 16 of the FTCA.  See H.R.Rep. No. 
580, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. (1959); 2 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin. News, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. pp. 1808-16 (1959).  It was 
assumed by some, however, that a certification procedure would normally be used.  Hearings on H.R. No. 432 Before the House 
Committee on the Judiciary, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 1, 17 (1959)."
1040,6," 15 U.S.C. § 54(a) provides in relevant part that: Any person, partnership, or corporation who violates any provision of section 52(a) of this title [dissemination of false 
advertisements] . . . shall, if the use of the commodity advertised may be injurious to health because of results from such 
use under the conditions prescribed in the advertisement thereof, or under such conditions as are customary or usual, or if 
such violation is with intent to defraud or mislead, be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be punished by a 
fine of not more than $5,000 or by imprisonment for not more than six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment . . . "
1041,7," Congressman Lea stated that: As to the man who advertises an article injurious to health or advertises with intent to defraud or mislead, the provisions of 
the bill . . . authorize an immediate prosecution of such a man regardless of what the Federal Trade Commission does.  He 
can be arrested and prosecuted immediately. 83 Cong. Rec. 406 (1938)."
1041,8," The Commission is also authorized to modify or set aside its orders whenever in its opinion ""conditions of fact or of law have so 
changed as to require such action or if the public interest shall so require . . ."" HN8[
]  15 U.S.C. § 45(b). "
1042,9," In United States v. Zucca, 351 U.S. 91, 100 L. Ed. 964, 76 S. Ct. 671 (1956), the Court held that the filing of ""an affidavit of 
good cause"" furnished by a private citizen was a jurisdictional prerequisite to the filing of a denaturalization suit under § 340(a) of 
the Immigration & Nationality Act of 1957, 8 U.S.C. § 1451(a).  It rejected the contention that the general duty imposed on United

to properly interpret FTC orders.  There, the district court dismissed two counts of a complaint in § 5 (l) civil penalty suit for 
failure to allege facts constituting a violation of the terms of the 1959 consent cease and desist order involved here."

provides in pertinent part: ""HN1[

create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or 
knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them: Provided, That nothing herein 
contained shall prevent differentials which make only due allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture, sale, or delivery 
resulting from the differing methods or quantities in which such commodities are to such purchasers sold or delivered . . . ."""
1083,2," A proviso to § 2 of the original Clayton Act excepted price discrimination ""on account of differences in the grade, quality, or 
quantity of the commodity sold . . . ."" 38 Stat. 730 (1914). "
1084,3," The commentators are somewhat divided on the dispute involved in this case.  Supporting the Commission's view are the 
Report of The Attorney General's National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws 158 (1955); Austin, Price Discrimination and 
Related Problems under the Robinson-Patman Act 39 (2d ed. 1959); Patman, The Robinson-Patman Act 27 (1938); Edwards, 
The Price Discrimination Law 31, 463-464 (1959); Seidman, Price Discrimination Cases, reprinted in 2 Hoffmann's Antitrust 
Law and Techniques 409, 424-428 (1963).  Contrary views are expressed by a minority of the Attorney General's Committee; in 
Rowe, Price Discrimination Under the Robinson-Patman Act 75 (1962); and in Cassady & Grether, The Proper Interpretation of 
""Like Grade and Quality"" within the Meaning of Section 2 (a) of the Robinson-Patman Act,  30 So. Cal. L. Rev. 241 (1957)."
1084,4," Mr. H. B. Teegarden, who was then counsel to the United States Wholesale Grocers Association, and who apparently played a 
large part in drafting the bill, Hearings on H. R. 4995 before the House Committee on the Judiciary, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 9, 
supplemented his oral testimony with a letter addressed in part to the proposed amendment: ""To amend the bill by inserting 'and brands,' after the words 'commodities of like grade and quality,' as suggested by Judge 
Watkins, although it may seem harmless at first sight, is a specious suggestion that would destroy entirely the efficacy of the bill 
against larger buyers. So amended, the bill would impose no limitation whatever upon price differentials, except as between 
different purchasers of the same brand. But where goods are put up under a private brand, there can only be one purchaser, 
namely the one for whom the brand is designed.  Neither Kroger nor any independent could use an A. & P. private brand of 
canned fruit, for example; and to so amend the bill would leave every manufacturer free to put up his standard goods under a 
private brand for a particular purchaser and give him any price discount or discriminations that he might demand. ""Under the Patman bill as it stands, manufacturers are still free to put up their products under private brands; but if they do so for 
one purchaser under his private brand, then they must be ready to do so on the same terms, relative to their comparative costs, 
for a competing purchaser under his private brand; and unless that equality of treatment is required and assured, the 
discriminations at which the bill is aimed cannot be suppressed."" Id., 2d Sess., at 469. "
1085,5," Borden argues that it spends large sums to ensure the high quality of its Borden brand milk on customers' shelves, inferring 
that there really is a difference between its own milk and the milk sold under private labels, at least by the time it reaches the 
consumer. Of course, if Borden could prove this difference, it is unlikely that the case would be here.  The findings are to the 
contrary in this case and we write on the premise that the two products are physically the same at the time of consumer 
purchase.  Borden's extra expenses in connection with its own milk are more relevant to the cost justification issue than to the 
question we have before us."
1085,6," The market acceptability test would hardly stop with insulating from inquiry the price differential between proprietary and private 
label sales.  That test would also immunize from the Act sales at different prices of the same product under two different 
producer-owned labels, the one being less advertised and having less market acceptability than the other.  And if it is ""consumer 
preferences,"" dissenting opinion, p. 648, which create the difference in grade or quality, why should not Borden be able to 
discriminate between two purchasers of private label milk, as long as one label commands a higher price from consumers than 
the other and hence is of a different grade and quality?  In this context perhaps the market acceptability test would be refined to 
preclude this differential on the grounds that Borden's customer, as distinguished from the consumer, will not pay more than his 
competitor for private label milk and therefore the milk sold by Borden under one private brand is really of the same grade and 
quality as the milk sold under the other brand even though ultimate consumers will pay more for one than the other.  Taking this 
approach, if Borden packed for one wholesale customer under two private labels, one having more consumer appeal than the "
1086,," other because of the customer's own advertising program, Borden must sell both brands at the same price it charges other 
private label customers because all such milk is of the same grade and quality.  At the same time, the customer buying from 
Borden under two labels could himself sell one label at a reduced price without inquiry under § 2 (a) because the milk in one 
container is no longer of the same grade and quality as that in the other, although both the milk and the containers came from 
Borden.  Such an approach would obviously focus not on consumer preference as determinative of grade and quality but on who 
spent the advertising money that created the preference -- Borden's customer, not Borden, created the preference and hence 
the milk is of the same grade and quality in Borden's hands but not in its customer's. The dissent would exempt the effective 
advertiser from the Act.  We think Congress intended to remit him to his defenses under the Act, including that of cost 
justification."
1086,7," This is not, of course, a helpful suggestion to those who think the congressional remedy would be ""very difficult if not 
impossible"" and who thus prefer the more ""reasonable approach"" through the courts.  See Cassady & Grether, supra, n. 3, at 
277."
1086,8," Section 2 (b), 15 U. S. C. § 13 (b) (1964 ed.), provides as follows: ""Upon proof being made, at any hearing on a complaint under this section, that there has been discrimination in price or services 
or facilities furnished, the burden of rebutting the prima-facie case thus made by showing justification shall be upon the person 
charged with a violation of this section, and unless justification shall be affirmatively shown, the Commission is authorized to 
issue an order terminating the discrimination: Provided, however, That nothing herein contained shall prevent a seller rebutting 
the prima-facie case thus made by showing that his lower price or the furnishing of services or facilities to any purchaser or 
purchasers was made in good faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor, or the services or facilities furnished by a 
competitor."""
1086,9," The Court of Appeals relied upon Callaway Mills Co., sub nom. Bigelow-Sanford Carpet Co., CCH Trade Reg. Rep. Transfer 
Binder, 1963-1965, para. 16,800;  Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 54 F. T. C. 277 (1957);  Standard Oil Co., 49 F. T. C. 923 (1953); and  
Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Co., 44 F. T. C. 351 (1948). Borden adds Gerber Products Co. v.  Beech-Nut Life Savers Co., 
160 F.Supp. 916 (D. C. S. D. N. Y. 1958). "
1087,1," For example, one wholesaler, a witness for the Commission, stated: ""Private label merchandise is no good for nobody unless there is a price on it. . . .  In the retail trade as a whole they haven't 
been too much interested in [private label evaporated milk] . . . frankly if it was the same price as advertised or 15 cents or 25 
cents a case under, it wouldn't sell, they couldn't give it away. . . .  It has got to have $ 1.50 or $ 2 a case spread to make it 
interesting."""
1087,2," No suggestion is made that any of the private label brands involved in this case show significant commercial differentiation from 
one another.  It is possible, of course, that by extensive promotion private label brands could achieve consumer acceptance 
equivalent to that of a premium brand. In that situation, the products would still be economically different under the market test of 
§ 2 (a) elucidated in this opinion, since the relevant comparison would exclude promotional efforts by persons other than the 
producer of the premium brand. Thus, promotional activities by customers of Borden in the present case could not affect the 
determination of ""like grade and quality"" with regard to sales by Borden.  Cf. Jordan, Robinson-Patman Act Aspects of Dual 
Distribution by Brand of Consumer Goods,  50 Cornell L. Q. 394, 406-407 (1965)."
1087,3," Cf. Chamberlin, The Theory of Monopolistic Competition 56 (8th ed. 1962): ""A general class of product is differentiated if any significant basis exists for distinguishing the goods (or services) of one seller 
from those of another.  Such a basis may be real or fancied, so long as it is of any importance whatever to buyers, and leads to 
a preference for one variety of the product over another.  Where such differentiation exists, even though it be slight, buyers will 
be paired with sellers, not by chance and at random (as under pure competition), but according to their preferences. "
1088,," ""Differentiation may be based upon certain characteristics of the product itself, such as exclusive patented features; trade-marks; 
trade names; peculiarities of the package or container, if any; or singularity in quality, design, color, or style. . . .  In so far as 
these and other intangible factors vary from seller to seller, the 'product' in each case is different, for buyers take them into 
account, more or less, and may be regarded as purchasing them along with the commodity itself."" See also Brown, Advertising and the Public Interest: Legal Protection of Trade Symbols,  57 Yale L. J. 1165, 1181 (1948): "". . . The buyer of an advertised good buys more than a parcel of food or fabric; he buys the pause that refreshes, the hand that 
has never lost its skill, the priceless ingredient that is the reputation of its maker.  All these may be illusions, but they cost money 
to create, and if the creators can recoup their outlay, who is the poorer?  Among the many illusions which advertising can 
fashion are those of lavishness, refinement, security, and romance.  Suppose the monetary cost of compounding a perfume is 
trivial; of what moment is this if the ads promise, and the buyer believes, that romance, even seduction, will follow its use?  The 
economist, whose dour lexicon defines as irrational any market behavior not dictated by a logical pecuniary calculus, may think it 
irrational to buy illusions; but there is a degree of that kind of irrationality even in economic man; and consuming man is full of it."""
1088,4," For example, a grocer testified in the proceedings before the Commission that: ""People are going into a grocery store to pick up groceries, the majority of the people buy something that is advertised that they 
have known for years or heard of for years or see highly advertised. They know it is a good product, they know it is fancy 
merchandise or best quality."" Another grocer testified that: ""A.  Some people say they want [Borden's] Silver Cow milk. In other words, for maybe a coupon on the side of the can or 
because they have been educated to want that brand. Some of them won't have anything but that.  Some of them won't have 
anything except Carnation, and some of them don't want anything except Pet. ""Q.  They don't care what price -- ""A.  If the doctor tells the woman to put the baby on Pet milk, that is all she wants, you couldn't interest her in something else. ""Q.  You couldn't give her something else, could you? ""A.  I doubt if I could."""
1088,5," The results of a house-to-house survey conducted for Borden by National Analysts, Inc., indicated that consumers selected 
Borden's premium brand because of its superior quality.  Comparable studies have reached a similar conclusion.  Cf. ""Mom 
Feels Quality, not Ad Cost, Makes Brand Item Costlier, 'Good House' Reports,"" Advertising Age, Dec. 7, 1964, p. 30."
1088,6," Borden's Food Products Division maintained a staff of field representatives who inspected code-datings on cans of Borden 
brand milk in retail stores, in order to insure that older milk was sold first off the retailer's shelves.  A witness for Borden testified 
that the principal dangers of long storage were discoloration of the milk, precipitation of calcium and other minerals, and 
separation and hardening of fat from the milk. As a further precaution against sales of defective milk, Borden dispatched its milk 
to wholesalers and retailers under a first-packed, first-shipped rotation plan that occasionally involved high-cost shipments from 
distant plants or warehouses.  In addition, before shipment from a cold storage warehouse, Borden ""tempered"" its premium 
brand milk in order to prevent condensation on the cans, which might have resulted in rust to the cans and damage to the labels."
1088,7," As counsel for the respondent candidly stated on oral argument to the Court, ""The difference as to the private label brand 
packed by Borden is that, as to that product, the Borden Company washes its hands of it at the factory door."" "
1089,8," The Court's suggestion that the commentators are about equally divided upon the issue before us is somewhat misleading.  It 
is true that the members of the Attorney General's National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws, Report, pp. 156-159 (1955), 
were sharply divided as to whether significant consumer preferences should be taken into account under the ""like grade and 
quality"" test of § 2 (a).  However, the very brief discussions of ""like grade and quality"" in Austin, Price Discrimination and Related 
Problems under the Robinson-Patman Act 39 (2d ed. 1959); Patman, Complete Guide to the Robinson-Patman Act 34-35 
(1963); and Edwards, The Price Discrimination Law 31, 463-464 (1959), are not addressed to the relevance of significant 
consumer preferences, and the minimal discussion in Seidman is at best ambiguous, Price Discrimination Cases, reprinted in 2 
Hoffmann's Antitrust Law and Techniques 409, 427-428 (1963).  Those cursory treatments go no further than the view, with 
which I wholly agree, that no blanket exemption from § 2 (a) is available for private label brands. But that view in no sense 
disposes of the concrete issue presented in this case.  Commentators who have in fact focussed on the significance of 
consumer preferences uniformly favor inclusion of commercial acceptance in the test of ""like grade and quality."" Rowe, Price 
Differentials and Product Differentiation: The Issues under the Robinson-Patman Act,  66 Yale L. J. 1 (1956); Rowe, Price 
Discrimination Under the Robinson-Patman Act 62-76 (1962); Cassady & Grether, The Proper Interpretation of ""Like Grade and 
Quality"" within the Meaning of Section 2 (a) of the Robinson-Patman Act,  30 So. Cal. L. Rev. 241 (1957); Jordan, Robinson-
Patman Act Aspects of Dual Distribution by Brand of Consumer Goods,  50 Cornell L. Q. 394 (1965)."
1089,9," The Court's suggestion, ante, p. 644, that a difference in label alone would exclude the reach of § 2 (a) if a market test were 
accepted for ""like grade and quality"" is no part of the present case and has never been offered as a serious interpretation of § 2 
(a).  Nor is there any issue raised here as to whether, under a market test of § 2 (a), a dubious pricing and branding policy 
adopted by a seller could ""validate itself"" and escape the Act by creating precarious distinctions in grade or quality.  The price 
differential between Borden's premium and private label brands is concededly grounded upon a legitimate and stable market 
preference for the premium product.  Moreover, the Commission's willingness to engage in the exhaustive analysis of injury to 
competition and cost justification under its ""physical identity"" test of § 2 (a) demonstrates that the Commission's resources would 
be more than adequate to determine the level of commercial preference sufficient to negate a finding of ""like grade and quality"" 
under a market test of § 2 (a)."
1089,10," Certain general language in the congressional reports may be taken, however, as supporting the interpretation that market 
factors are relevant in the construction of § 2 (a).  The Report of the House Committee on the Judiciary stated that the general 
object of the bill was ""to amend section 2 of the Clayton Act so as to suppress more effectually discriminations between 
customers of the same seller not supported by sound economic differences in their business positions . . . ."" H. R. Rep. No. 
2287, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 7.  (Emphasis added.) The Report of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary is phrased in 
substantially the same language.  S. R. Rep. No. 1502, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 3."
1089,11," The remarks of Representative Patman were even more offhand than the opinion of the Court indicates.  Prefacing the portion 
of his remarks quoted by the Court, Mr. Patman said, ""I only have a very short time, and I must finish my statement.  I have not 
time to discuss that feature . . . ."" "
1090,12," The predominant concern of Congress in enacting the Robinson-Patman amendments to the Clayton Act was to abolish the 
notorious price discriminations that infected the post-Depression economy, especially the blanket immunity then available for 
quantity discounts under § 2 of the Clayton Act. An obvious commercial evil at the time was the widespread practice of offering 
private label brands to favored customers at rates substantially lower than the rates offered to competing purchasers. The 
abortive attempt, vigorously opposed by Mr. Teegarden, to introduce ""and brands"" into the ""like grade and quality"" provision 
would have left that evil completely unremedied.  Cf. 80 Cong. Rec. 8234-8236 (rejection of amendments proposing the addition 
of ""and design"" and ""purchased under like conditions"" to the ""like grade and quality"" clause)."
1090,13," In  Hansen Inoculator Co., 26 F. T. C. 303, and the two United States Rubber Co. cases,  28 F. T. C. 1489;  46 F. T. C. 998, 
the finding of ""like grade and quality"" was either conceded by the respondent or not challenged.  In addition, in Hansen 
Inoculator, there was significant evidence that the private label product was in fact trading on the reputation of the premium 
product.  Further, in Hansen Inoculator, as in  Page Dairy Co., 50 F. T. C. 395, it is doubtful that even the labels on the two 
products were distinguishable.  In  Whitaker Cable Corp., 51 F. T. C. 958, the resale prices of both products were identical, so 
that no commercial preference could have been proved in any event.  Finally, in the first United States Rubber case and in 
Whitaker Cable Corp., there was substantial discrimination by the seller between various purchasers of the private label brands. 
In setting aside the order of the Commission in the present case, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit emphasized that in 
none of these cases was there any showing that the brand names affected the market price of the products sold."

817;  Atalanta Trading Corp., 53 F. T. C. 565, 571. In setting aside the Commission's order in Atalanta, the Court of Appeals for

by a supplier's making artificial distinctions in his product but this does not mean that all distinctions are to be disregarded.""

specifically refused to ""approve of the Commission's construing the Act inconsistently from one case to the next, as appears 
most advantageous to its position in a particular case.""  339 F.2d 133, at 139. See the comment of Commissioner Mason: ""First 
the Commission finds you guilty of price discrimination by disregarding popularity of goods, and finds the grade and quality of the 
commodities in question are the same; then they knock out your meeting of competition defense because your goods are more 
popular than others, even if the commodities in question are of like grade and quality."" Discriminate in Price between Different 
Purchasers of Commodities of Like Grade, Quality and Popularity, Proc. Am. Bar Assn. Section of Antitrust Law 82, 91-92

1091,16," The Court's brief discussion of the adverse economic effect of the Fifth Circuit's ruling is concerned primarily with the 
supposed injury to secondary line competition.  The present proceeding arose as the direct result of the primary line injury 
caused to midwestern packers of private label evaporated milk when Borden expanded its plants in Tennessee and South 
Carolina to include private label operation, but the opinion of the Court nowhere discusses such competition. "
1092,17," It is not clear that the ""injury to competition"" and ""cost justification"" issues will be reached on the remand.  As the opinion of the 
Court suggests, ante, p. 646, the existence of price discrimination is an issue that remains open in the Court of Appeals.  If 
Borden is able to demonstrate that the price differential between its premium and private label brands is not a price 
discrimination, the inquiry by the Commission is at an end, and no issue of injury to competition or cost justification under § 2 (a) 
is reached.  Nothing in  FTC v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 363 U.S. 536, a case concerned only with territorial price discrimination, 
requires an equation in all circumstances between a price differential and price discrimination. So long as Borden makes private 
label brands available to all customers of its premium milk, it is unlikely that price discrimination within the meaning of § 2 (a) can 
be made out.  Boss Mfg. Co. v.  Payne Glove Co., 71 F.2d 768, 770-771 (C. A. 8th Cir.); Austin, Price Discrimination and 
Related Problems under the Robinson-Patman Act 21 (2d ed. 1959); Rowe, Price Discrimination Under the Robinson-Patman 
Act, supra, at 97-99."

1092,19," See Staff Report to the Federal Trade Commission, Economic Inquiry into Food Marketing, Part II, The Frozen Fruit, Juice and 
Vegetable Industry (1962); Jordan, supra, n. 8, at 413-417. "
1093,20," The Commission concedes that there is no evidence in the record that Borden refused to sell private label milk to any 
customer who specifically requested it.  Borden's private label business in the period covered by these proceedings was 
substantial.  In 1957, Borden sold 4,300,000 cases of its premium brand evaporated milk and 1,100,000 cases of private label 
milk (government and export business excluded); net sales of these products were $ 27,600,000 and $ 5,700,000, respectively.  
A major source of Borden's private label business was provided by cooperative associations of wholesalers and retailers, so 
that, in fact, there was an opportunity for large numbers of small retailers to compete in the sale of private label brands of 
evaporated milk obtained from Borden.  One such group, whose purchases accounted for 11% of Borden's private label volume 
in 1957, had more than 1,000 retailer members.  Not all retailers, however, availed themselves of the opportunity to market 
private label milk. One wholesaler testified that, a year after his private label brand had been offered to the 600 retail grocers in 
his service area, only 50 of the grocers had become regular customers. "

1102,3, 373 Mich lxxxix.  -- Reporter. 
1103,*," ""It is clear that just as the antimonopoly act [CL 1948, §§ 445.701-445.712; 445.761-445.767 (Stat Ann 1962 Rev §§ 28.31-
28.39, 28.61-28.67)] contained no specific exemption as to banking, neither does the Michigan financial institutions act [CL 
1948, § 487.1 et seq. (Stat Ann 1957 Rev § 23.711 et seq.)] contain a specific exemption as to monopoly. The addition of such 
exemption, if consistent with legislative intent, is so simple and so much to be expected, that the omission seems to us of great 
significance in determination of this issue. ""Nor does our examination of the scope of the Michigan financial institutions act uphold the 'comprehensive' argument advanced 
to us by defendants.  For example, the power vested in the banking commissioner by sections 99 and 112 of the Michigan 
financial institutions act (CL 1948, §§ 487.99, 487.112 [Stat Ann 1957 Rev §§ 23.852, 23.865]) appears to be the examination of 
the proposed liquidation for the purpose of protecting depositors and creditors.  If the public is protected from the sort of 
monopolistic practice in banking demonstrated in this case, the protection is not to be found in the Michigan financial institutions 
act. ""Defendants likewise argue with vehemence that in many other situations under express authority of the banking commissioner 
and authorization of the Michigan financial institutions act, 1-bank cities have been created or are being maintained in Michigan.  
We have no doubt that the Michigan financial institutions act has established, as a matter of State policy, a concern for the 
stability and economic soundness of the banks in the State.  These considerations have in some situations been placed above 
the maintenance of free and unlimited competition.  We recognize, too, this State policy must be read in conjunction with any 
application of the antimonopoly law to banking. ""The purpose, however, is to protect the public against imprudent banking, not 'to deter competition or foster monopoly.' Moran 
v. State Banking Commissioner, 322 Mich 230, 243. ""What prevents the application of this argument to this case is the fact that Port Huron was supporting, and obviously could 
continue to support, 2 general banking institutions.  This was not a liquidation founded on economic necessity or demanding 
State approval on grounds of protection of depositors or creditors of any bank. ""Nor do we have before us any fact situation presenting the question of creation of monopoly through voluntary merger of 
previously competitive banks with banking commission approval under procedures established by the Michigan financial 
institutions act.  While declining to pass on an issue clearly not before us, we note that if there are, or have been, other 
unrestrained violations of the antimonopoly laws, this fact could be of no benefit to defendants.  Society of Good Neighbors v. "

Mich 663; People v. Buckley, 302 Mich 12; Edwards v. Auditor General, 161 Mich 639. And we find nothing in the history or 
language of these 2 pieces of legislation to support an argument of legislative intention of implied repeal. ""We hold that the Michigan financial institutions act did not either expressly or by implication exempt banking from the operation 
of the Michigan antimonopoly laws."" Peoples Savings Bank v. Stoddard, 359 Mich 297, 331-333 (83 ALR2d 344). "
