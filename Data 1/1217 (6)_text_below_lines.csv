38,1," While Associated General Contractors is a standing case, it aids in analyzing CIG's claims. The concepts of standing and 
antitrust injury are similar, and many courts have incorporated Brunswick into their standing tests. See, e.g., John Lenore & Co. 
v. Olympia Brewing Co., 550 F.2d 495 (9th Cir. 1977). Justice Marshall, the author of Brunswick, described that opinion as one 
denying standing.  Associated General Contractors, 459 U.S.  at 549 (Marshall, J., dissenting). "
40,2," In Associated General Contractors, the union failed to allege that any collective bargaining agreement was broken as a result of 
the violation, that the share of the market controlled by unionized firms had diminished, that union membership declined, or that 
its revenues decreased.  Associated General Contractors, 459 U.S. at 542. "
52,3," NGPL also cites the decision in Bill's Coal Co., Inc. v. Board of Pub. Util., 682 F.2d 883 (10th Cir. 1982). That case is 
inapposite. The court held that, absent some effect on either party's performance, urging an interpretation of a contract which 
does not reflect the parties' intent is not a breach or repudiation of a contract.  Id. at 885. NGPL did not merely espouse a 
particular interpretation of the Service Agreement. Its actions clearly affected both parties' performance. "
57,4," NGPL also claims that Jury Instruction No. 16 confused the jury by incorrectly stating the effect of FERC's orders. This 
contention is addressed earlier in the opinion. See supra text at 51-56 NGPL also asserts that the Court excluded relevant 
evidence of FERC proceedings. The Court, however, permitted witnesses to testify concerning any FERC order that formed the 
basis of their opinion or influenced their actions. "
61,1," Not only was the four-year statute involved, 15 U.S.C. § 15b, but also a one-year extension thereof where a private case 
follows a government enforcement proceeding.  American Pipe, 414 U.S. at 541-42, 94 S. Ct. at 760 (applying § 5(b) of the 
Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, as amended, 15 U.S.C. § 16(b)). "
62,2," See Ramirez de Arellano v. Alvarez de Choudens, 575 F.2d 315 (1st Cir.1978) HN5[
] (so long as actions are not barred by 
the pendency of prior actions, ""prior judicial actions do not toll the statute of limitations, no matter how close their relationship to 
the one at bar."" Id. at 319 & n.3.); accord Pace Industries, Inc. v. Three Phoenix Co., 813 F.2d 234, 240-41 (9th Cir.1987). "
63,3," Drumm raised no issue whether tolling could be based on the speculative damage rationale of Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine 
Research, Inc., 401 U.S. 321, 91 S. Ct. 795, 28 L. Ed. 2d 77 (1971). We reject appellee's motion for an award of attorneys' fees. "
70,1," When originally filed on April 10, 1979, this case was assigned to the Hon. Norman Roettger, United States District Court, 
Southern District of Florida. The instant motion was first filed by Plaintiff in 1982. On October 7, 1985, Judge Roettger denied 
Plaintiff's Motion for Default and Sanctions ""without prejudice."" On the same date, the case was reassigned to this Division of the 
Court. Plaintiff renewed its Motion for Default and Sanctions on October 28, 1985. In view of the nature and gravity of 
Defendant's alleged discovery abuses, we set this matter down for full evidentiary hearing and reconsidered the issue de novo. "
71,2," We note that both Parties have submitted lengthy briefs on this matter, amply addressing the disputed events and their legal 
significance. In view of the allegations raised and the findings entered, we additionally observe that Defendant's present counsel 
have been consistently forthright and honorable in enlightening this Court as to this unfortunate and sadly avoidable course of 
events. "
72,3," This and all subsequent ""Tr."" citations refer to the transcript of the evidentiary hearing which was held on March 12-13, 1986. "
81,4," It should be noted in this regard that, prior to obtaining his law degree from the University of Texas, Mr. Arnold received a 
bachelor's degree in physics from Harvard College and a master's degree in physics from the University of California, San 
Diego. [Arnold Dep. II, at 11.] "
83,5," Whether the personnel carrying out this year-end document destruction actually knew the guidelines regarding document 
retention set forth in OHD's Standard Operating Procedure is a matter of considerable doubt. As we shall discuss shortly, neither 
OHD's President, Robert Haugh, nor the corporation's Senior Vice-President in charge of manufacturing and sales, Robert 
Hagman, could describe even the basic outlines of the corporation's Standard Operating Procedure in this area. [Haugh Dep. at 
7-9; Hagman Dep. at 15.] Moreover, Mr. Arnold himself testified that the Standard Operating Procedure with regard to document 
retention ""is more honored in the breach than in the observance."" [Tr. 270; Arnold Dep. I, at 83.]"
83,6," Mr. Arnold's admission that documents were destroyed without being reviewed as to their possible relevance to Telectron's 
Request for Production was offered at the evidentiary hearing held before this Court on March 12-13, 1986. This admission 
notably contradicted Mr. Arnold's earlier deposition testimony, in which he responded affirmatively to the question: ""Were all of 
the documents within the custody, control or possession of Overhead Door Corporation reviewed pursuant to Telectron's request 
for production of documents?"" [Tr. 265-69; Arnold Dep. I, at 43.] Subsequent to giving this earlier testimony, Mr. Arnold wrote a 
letter to the official reporter of the deposition, Mrs. Carol Bates, asking her to strike his affirmative answer, ""yes,"" from the 
transcript. [Tr. 267; Plaintiff's Ex. 26 (Letter dated January 15, 1981).] When asked at the evidentiary hearing why he had 
requested that the reporter strike this response, Mr. Arnold offered no explanation. [Tr. 267-69.] "
84,7," On his desk, Mr. Hagman kept what he referred to as his ""current file,"" a sheaf of files approximately twelve to fifteen inches 
thick. The fourteen to fifteen files in this collection contained correspondence pertaining to various of OHD's manufacturing 
operations. [Hagman Dep. at 17-18.] When he periodically visited a manufacturing plant, Mr. Hagman would bring along the file 
folder pertaining to that plant and, after discussing with the relevant personnel any issues raised by documents in the file, he 
would discard these documents. Additionally he reported that, at the end of each year, he personally would sift through his 
collection of files and ""just throw out everything that wasn't current."" [Id.] At his deposition testimony on July 21, 1981, he 
recalled having last carried out this sort of review at the end of 1980. [Id. at 18.] "
87,8," Subsections (c) and (d) of Rule 37 are exceptions to the general principle that Rule 37 sanctions are to be imposed only upon 
violation of a court order.  Dorey v. Dorey, 609 F.2d 1128, 1134-35 (5th Cir. 1980). In the case at bar, the destruction occurred 
when the court's jurisdiction was first invoked; i.e., on the very day that the Complaint and Request for Production were served 
upon the Defendant. As Plaintiff's First Request for Production was served in compliance with the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure, Defendant was bound to respond to that request as provided by Rule 34. There was no cause, nor time, for the court 
to intervene in the immediate aftermath of the service of these papers. Accordingly, the absence of a court order eliminates Rule 
37(a) from our consideration of sanctions, and Rule 37(b) only applies insofar as sanctions provided thereunder can be invoked 
through the application of Rule 37(d). See, e.g., Fox v. Studebaker-Worthington, Inc., 516 F.2d 989 (8th Cir. 1975) (dismissal of 
complaint upheld as a sanction under Rule 37(d), where plaintiff at first maintained that he had destroyed recorded tapes of 
""bugged"" conversations and later asserted that no wiretapping or taperecording had ever occurred). "
88,9," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, Ala., the Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding precedent those decisions rendered by the Former 
Fifth Circuit prior to October 1, 1981.  661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir. 1981). "
92,10," HN20[
] Where the evidence clearly reveals that an effort to destroy or conceal documents was carried out in bad faith, the 
drawing of an adverse inference as to the contents of the documents has not merely been permitted; it has in some cases been 
required. See, e.g., Alexander v. National Farmers Organization, 687 F.2d 1173, 1205-06 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 
937, 77 L. Ed. 2d 313, 103 S. Ct. 2108 (1983). In Alexander, the Eighth Circuit concluded that one of the parties had engaged in 
""a deliberate pattern of shuffling and hiding documents--to warehouses, homes or other locations--specifically to avoid 
discovery."" Id. In addition, it was stipulated that this same party had ordered the destruction of certain documents, and that some 
of these documents had, in fact, been destroyed. Id. Terming these discovery abuses ""outrageous,"" the Circuit held the trial 
court in error for its failure to draw factual inferences adverse to the offending party ""on matters undertaken in or through offices 
and individuals involved in the destruction of documents."" Id. at 1205-06 (citations omitted). "
95,11," Mr. Foster testified that he had been personally advised by OHD's outside counsel, Mr. Barkett of the Miami law firm of Steel, 
Hector and Davis, that OHD had completed its review of the files in the old building: Q: Was it your understanding at the time you destroyed the documents during the move from the warehouse that the 
Overhead Door attorneys were through with those documents? A: Yes. Q: Where did you get that impression? A: From Mr. Barkett. Q: What did he say to you? A: As I remember, I asked if they were--had completed their review of all of the documents in the shipping building . . . .. He 
said, ""Yes, we are through."" "
96,," [Foster Dep. at 63.] At the evidentiary hearing held before this Court in March 1986, no witness was presented to refute Mr. Foster's assertion 
that he believed in good faith that OHD had concluded its inspection of files at the Fort Lauderdale facility. We also have no 
basis for doubting his declaration that he had not been advised that Telectron and OHD had signed an agreement to 
preserve all documents produced pursuant to the various requests for production. [Foster Dep. at 37, 47, 70-71; 
Defendant's Ex. 25 (Letter of Agreement, February 4, 1980).] Unaware of this agreement, Mr. Foster faithfully adhered to 
Telectron's pre-existing document retention policy, which called for the preservation of corporate records for a minimum of 
seven years, in conformity with the mandates of the Internal Revenue Service. [Foster Dep. at 15; Arthur Horvath Dep. at 
49; John J. Lucca Dep. at 53; Tr. 483.]  [**97]"
96,12," Mr. Foster, in sifting through the files at the old Fort Lauderdale facility, took pains only to throw away documents dated prior 
to 1973--i.e., in full compliance with these guidelines. [Foster Dep. at 22-23, 43-44.] Moreover, Mr. Foster retained pre-1973 
records which he regarded as being ""of a permanent nature."" [Id. at 43-44.]"
96,13," Mr. Horvath also believed that Mr. Oates' correspondence was copied and sent to Telectron's Fort Lauderdale storage facility--
a belief corroborated by Defendant's acknowledgement that Telectron did, in fact, produce ""numerous Frank Oates' documents"" 
in Fort Lauderdale. [OHD's Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Motion for Default and Sanctions, at 48 n.; Horvath Dep. at 31-
33.]"
96,14," Also possibly destroyed by Mr. Horvath or his secretaries were copies of old invoices pertaining to the Ray-Dor corporation, a 
garage door operator plant which was acquired by Telectron in 1974. [Horvath Dep. at 4-5.] These Ray-Dor documents, 
discarded pursuant to Telectron's seven-year retention policy in the beginning of 1980 and 1981, were dated no more recently 
than 1972, and therefore pre-dated Ray-Dor's acquisition by Telectron. [Id. at 25.] It is difficult for us to comprehend what 
bearing these files, pertaining to a then-unrelated business entity, might have had on Telectron's claims against OHD. Moreover, 
as Mr. Horvath was unaware of the suit against OHD at the time that the Ray-Dor documents were destroyed, his actions cannot 
be seen as part of a willful attempt to obstruct the discovery process or to conceal documents relevant to the case. [Id. at 25.] "
102,1," In rejecting Valley's claim that Renfield and Valley's competitors had conspired to terminate Valley and thereby increase 
wholesale prices of Renfield products, we held that the circumstantial evidence in the limited preliminary injunction record was 
""too tenuous to require the trier of fact to draw the inference [of a conspiracy] that Valley asked him to draw"" and that ""plaintiff 
did not prove an improper motive by its supplier."" Valley Liquors, Inc. v. Renfield Importers, Ltd., 678 F.2d 742, 744 (7th Cir. 
1982). We also rejected Valley's contention that Renfield's termination of Valley was an unreasonable restraint of trade. We 
noted that Valley had not sought to prove Renfield's market power, which we held is a preliminary and necessary step in 
establishing illegality under the balancing test set forth in Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 57 n.27, 53 L. 
Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977). 678 F.2d at 745. "
103,2," The district court properly treated the motion to dismiss Count III as a motion for summary judgment on that count pursuant to 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)."
103,3," Valley asserts that the district court acted improperly in weighing the evidence. Valley does not, however, provide any 
examples. We find that the district court properly considered Valley's evidence, took inferences in Valley's favor, and decided 
that the evidence was not adequate to persuade a reasonable jury that Renfield conspired to modify Valley's distribution rights."
103,4," Valley argues that the above standards for summary judgment should be considered in light of a general reluctance to grant 
summary judgment in complex antitrust litigation. Valley cites Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, 368 U.S. 464, 7 L. Ed. 2d 
458, 82 S. Ct. 486 (1962) and that Court's statement that ""summary procedures should be used sparingly in complex antitrust 
litigation where motive and intent play leading roles, the proof is largely in the hands of the alleged conspirators, and hostile 
witnesses thicken the plot."" Recently, however, courts have not displayed such hesitation to grant summary judgment in antitrust cases. In Matsushita 
Electric Industry Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986), a recent antitrust case 
involving section 1, the Supreme Court did not cite Poller and was not reluctant to affirm a grant of summary judgment. Indeed, "
104,," the Court appeared to encourage the use of summary judgment where appropriate in Matsushita and two other cases handed 
down the same term, see Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); Celotex 
Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Furthermore, in another decision handed down during 
the 1985 term, the Supreme Court rejected a reading of Poller that would mean that a party could defeat a "" properly supported"" 
summary judgment motion ""without offering any concrete evidence from which a reasonable juror could return a verdict in his 
favor and by merely asserting that the jury might, and legally could, disbelieve"" the defendant's denial of a claim.  Anderson v. 
Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 2514, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). This court has stated in Lupia v. Stella D'Oro 
Biscuit Co., 586 F.2d 1163 (7th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 982, 99 S. Ct. 1791, 60 L. Ed. 2d 242 (1979), that summary 
judgment should be a favored practice in antitrust cases. The very nature of antitrust litigation would encourage summary disposition of such cases when permissible. Not only do 
antitrust trials often encompass a great deal of expensive and time consuming discovery and trial work, but also . . . the 
statutory private antitrust remedy of treble damages affords a special temptation for the institution of vexatious litigation . . . 
The ultimate determination, after trial, that an antitrust claim is unfounded, may come too late to guard against the evils that 
occur along the way.  Id. at 1167. See Terry's Floor Fashions, Inc. v. Burlington Industries, Inc., 763 F.2d 604, 610 (4th Cir. 1985) (""Summary 
judgment clearly remains, however, an appropriate procedure in antitrust litigation. Rule 56 should not be 'read out of antitrust 
cases.'"" (quoting First National Bank of Arizona v. Cities Service Co., 391 U.S. 253, 289, 20 L. Ed. 2d 569, 88 S. Ct. 1575 
(1968))."
104,5," Valley asserts that Renfield engaged in a horizontal conspiracy. Alleged price fixing between a manufacturer and distributors, 
however, is more properly termed a ""vertical"" conspiracy. See Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Corp. v. Esprit De Corp., 769 
F.2d 919, 923 (2d Cir. 1985); Red Diamond Supply, Inc. v. Liquid Carbonic Corp., 637 F.2d 1001, 1007 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. 
denied, 454 U.S. 827, 70 L. Ed. 2d 102, 102 S. Ct. 119 (1981). A horizontal conspiracy occurs when the source of a conspiracy 
is a combination of distributors. H & B Equipment Co. v. International Harvester Co., 577 F.2d 239, 245 (5th Cir. 1978). The 
actual label placed on the conspiracy is a ""pedantic distinction,"" see Valley I, 678 F.2d at 744, as the Monsanto standard applies 
regardless of which label is attached.  Burlington Coat Factory, 769 F.2d at 923. "
106,6," Specfically, Valley described a situation in which a manufacturer was receiving price complaints from two of its three 
distributors regarding the third distributor's undercutting of price, the third not being a ""free rider"" or a ""cherry picker."" The third 
distributor was terminated, sales decreased, and the two complaining distributors continued to sell at the same or higher prices. "
107,7," Free riders are those retailers who do not engage in promotional activities such as advertising or provide service and repair 
facilities, while those services are performed by other retailers. See Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 55, 
97 S. Ct. 2549, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977)."
107,8," A cherry picker is a distributor that exploits only the easiest accounts or the best-selling items of a full line of products, ignoring 
accounts that are more costly or difficult to serve. A desire to avoid cherry pickers is often a reason given for exclusive 
distributorships. "
108,9," Although Gunn specifically states that he has been asked to examine whether Renfield possessed market power and whether 
Renfield's conduct tended to reduce competition, which are issues relating to Count II and not to Count I, he nonetheless 
attempts to discredit Campagna's reason for the termination."
108,10," Valley also attempts to distinguish Reborn Enterprises, Inc. v. Fine Child, Inc., 590 F. Supp. 1423 (S.D.N.Y. 1984), aff'd, 754 
F.2d 1072 (2d Cir. 1985). Valley has mischaracterized Reborn. Valley asserts that the district court mistakenly relied on this case 
because there was evidence in Reborn that plaintiff was a free rider and because the plaintiff's president's ""churlish behavior,"" 
which included persistent threats of suit, provided an independent reason for the defendant to terminate the plaintiff. The Reborn 
court, however, did not discuss either of these factors in relation to the section 1 vertical price-fixing conspiracy claim. The 
Reborn court stressed the plaintiff's president's churlish behavior as a justification for the plaintiff's termination in the context of a 
discussion of vertical territorial restrictions under the Rule of Reason analysis. See id. at 1441-42. The Reborn court might have 
considered this independent business reason for termination in its vertical price-fixing conspiracy analysis if it had had the 
chance. It did not, however, reach that issue because it found that the plaintiff did not provide the probative evidence beyond 
that of complaints and termination necessary to satisfy the Monsanto test. Specifically, the court held that the plaintiff did not 
""advance sufficient evidence to raise a genuine dispute as to whether defendants engaged in coercive activity to force 
adherence to its suggested retail price and plaintiffs and other retailers actually adhered to that price."" Id. at 1439. "
120,1," The FCC anticipated the possible evolution of a highly competitive secondary market in the distribution of cellular service 
through resale.  86 F.C.C. at 476, 510. The FCC ordered that no restrictions on resale or shared use of cellular services would 
be permitted, and that the wireline carriers were required to ""provide system capacity to non-affiliated retailers or resellers on a 
non-discriminatory basis and on the same terms and conditions as its own distribution arm."" Id. at 510-11. "
121,2," Advanced Mobile Phone Service, Inc. (AMPS) was to be the independent subsidiary of AT & T providing cellular service in all 
markets served by AT & T. After the divestiture of AT & T in 1984, AMPS also was divided into regional companies. NewVector 
Communications, Inc. is the successor-in-interest of AMPS in Phoenix."
121,3," Metro Mobile has not moved for leave to amend its Complaint pursuant to F.R.Civ.P. 15(a). Because it appears that NewVector 
would not oppose such a motion, the court will consider the claims involving the retail market abandoned for purposes of this 
motion. "
123,4," NewVector argues that the clear contemplation test applies only when Parker immunity is sought by a municipality. In Town of 
Hallie v. City of Eau Claire, the Court reaffirmed the language set forth in City of Lafayette, 435 U.S. at 415, requiring a showing 
that the legislature contemplated the kind of action complained of.  Town of Hallie, 471 U.S. 34, 44, 105 S. Ct. 1713, 85 L. Ed. 
2d 24 (1985). The Court also stated, however, that ""it is not necessary . . . for the state legislature to have stated explicitly that it 
expected the City to engage in conduct that would have anticompetitive effects."" Id. at 42. It is satisfactory that the 
anticompetitive effects are ""a foreseeable result"" and ""logically would result"" from the authority to regulate granted to the 
municipality. Id.  These added factors, not mentioned in Southern Motor Carriers, presumably compensate for the fact the active 
state supervision requirement of Midcal does not apply in cases involving municipalities, id. at 46. In addition, the Ninth Circuit 
has held that ""executive agencies [unlike cities] . . .  are entitled to Parker immunity for actions taken pursuant to their 
constitutional or statutory authority, regardless of whether these particular actions or their anticompetitive effects were 
contemplated by the legislature."" Charley's Taxi Radio Dispatch v. SIDA of Hawaii, 810 F.2d 869, 876 (9th Cir. 1987). "
124,5," The ACC has not yet determined whether NewVector Retail and other retailers of cellular service are public service 
corporations subject to regulation by the ACC. In re Application of AMPS, Docket No.  U-2416-83-100 at 5 (July 19, 1984). "
125,6," See, e.g., Midcal, 445 U.S. at 99 (California Code expressly required wine retailers to sell wine at a price set in fair trade 
contracts or price schedules established by producers, wholesalers, and rectifiers); New Motor Vehicle Board of California v. 
Orrin W. Fox Co., 439 U.S. 96, 98, 58 L. Ed. 2d 361, 99 S. Ct. 403 (1978) (California law required a motor vehicle manufacturer 
to secure approval of a state agency before opening a retail dealership within the same area as an existing franchisee); Bates v. 
State Bar of Arizona, 433 U.S. 350, 355, 53 L. Ed. 2d 810, 97 S. Ct. 2691 (1977) (rule of Arizona Supreme Court expressly 
prohibited advertising by lawyers); Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 776-77, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572, 95 S. Ct. 2004 (1975) 
(County Bar Association published a minimum fee schedule for lawyers); Parker, 317 U.S. at 346-48 (California statute required 
formulation of proration marketing program for various commodities). "
128,7," In the exercise of its power to prescribe just and reasonable rates . . . the commission shall give due consideration, among 
other factors, to the inherent advantages of transportation by such carriers; to the effect of rates upon the movement of traffic by 
such carriers; to the need, in the public interest, of adequate and efficient transportation service by such carriers at the lowest 
cost consistent with the furnishing of such services; and to the need of revenues sufficient to enable such carriers, under honest, 
economical, and efficient management, to provide such service. Miss. Code Ann. section 77-7-221."
128,8," The situation in Community Communications Co. v. City of Boulder, 455 U.S. 40, 70 L. Ed. 2d 810, 102 S. Ct. 835 (1982) is 
distinguishable. In Boulder the state constitution established ""home rule"" which gave municipalities extensive powers of self-
government.  Id. at 43-44. The broad powers allowed municipalities to elect free market competition as an alternative to 
regulation as to the cable television industry at issue in the case.  Id. at 56. The Supreme Court held that anticompetitive actions 
on the part of the city were not protected by state action immunity because the state as sovereign had not expressed a policy to 
displace competition with regulation. The policy decision was made by the city, not the state.  As discussed above, the State of 
Arizona has expressed a policy that rates of public service corporations are to be just and reasonable as determined by the 
ACC. "
129,9," It is understandable that Metro Mobile did not challenge the ACC's failure to subject NewVector's wholesale tariff to fair value 
cost justification. As an imminent wholesale provider itself, Metro Mobile likely did not want fair value analysis of its tariff."
129,10," Further, once Metro Mobile began to offer wholesale cellular service, the price squeeze issue became moot because of the 
competition in the wholesale market. As such, the ACC's failure to subject NewVector's tariff to cost of service and rate of return 
analysis in August 1986, after Metro Mobile entered the wholesale market, is irrelevant to the issue of price squeeze raised in 
this action. "
130,11," The question of whether a particular product, market, or service, ""deregulated"" at the time of the alleged anticompetitive 
conduct, is subject to antitrust scrutiny is better considered under the active supervision prong of the Midcal test. Since the 
activities challenged in this lawsuit have not been ""deregulated"" under section 40-281(E), the court need not consider whether 
the oversight accorded a section 40-281(E) product, market, or service satisfies the active supervision test. "
132,12," When asked by this court why it did not appeal the ACC's interim approval of NewVector's wholesale tariff to the superior 
court, counsel for Metro Mobile responded: ""Because we believe the antitrust laws apply and that's our remedy, your Honor."" 
Reporter's Transcript, February 9, 1987, at 47. "
133,14," There is no dispute that the relevant geographic market is the Phoenix Metropolitan Statistical Area as defined by the FCC. 
Metro Mobile defines the product market as cellular telephone service, while NewVector argues that it should also include other 
forms of mobile two-way communication. NewVector has accepted Metro Mobile's definition of the product market for purposes 
of this motion."
133,15," NewVector argues that Metro Mobile must prove both the ability to control prices and exclude competition. Metro Mobile 
contends that it need show only one or the other to prove monopoly power. Since the court finds that NewVector could do 
neither during the headstart period, the court need not address the dispute. "
134,16," This evidence was presented under seal pursuant to court order.  Metro Mobile argues that its expert witness testified during 
the preliminary injunction hearing that NewVector's anticompetitive activities ""could result either in Metro Mobile not being able to 
enter the wholesale market or, if it did enter, doing so in a weakened state such that it would not be a strong competitive force in 
that market."" Metro Mobile's Response at 14. A review of the record shows that the expert witness was testifying only as to his 
interpretation of the allegations of Metro Mobile's complaint, and not as to his opinion of what actually would occur. This in no 
way contradicts extensive unrefuted evidence that Metro Mobile had the ability and intention to enter the wholesale market no 
matter what NewVector did. There is no question of fact as to this issue that would prevent the entry of summary judgment."
134,17," Undisputed testimony in the record indicates that the Phoenix market can support 180,000 cellular customers. In March 1986, 
at the end of the headstart period, only 3.8% of this total, 6849, were using cellular service. Reporter's Transcript, February 26, 
1986, pp. 146-47. "
135,18," The record from the preliminary injunction hearing shows that Metro Mobile won a large contract with Maricopa County by 
bidding a price less than that submitted by NewVector. "
136,19," Metro Mobile argues that there is a genuine question of material fact as to whether NewVector acted in a manner consistent 
with the belief that the Arizona constitutional and legislative scheme met the requirements of state action immunity. Metro Mobile 
raised this issue earlier in a motion to continue its time to respond to the summary judgment motion in order to conduct 
discovery under F.R.Civ.P. 56(f). At that time the court ruled that NewVector's belief and actions regarding the applicability of the 
state action immunity doctrine are irrelevant to the determination of whether the immunity applied; the court has not changed its 
opinion.  See Llewellyn, 765 F.2d at 774 (""The availability of Parker immunity, however, does not depend on the subjective 
motivations of the individual actors, but rather on the satisfaction of the objective standards set forth in Parker and authorities 
which interpret it."") "
153,1," NEC was incorporated on July 17, 1899, as a joint venture between Western Electric Company of the United States and two 
Japanese individuals. Initially, the Company functioned as a sales agent for telephone equipment manufactured by Western 
Electric, but soon commenced production of similar equipment in Japan. In 1925, Western Electric sold its interest in NEC to 
International Telephone & Telegraphic (""ITT""). Seven years later the Sumitomo family holding group of Japan acquired a 
substantial stock interest in the company, which it sold to the public in 1948 following the passage of Japanese anti-monopoly 
laws. Thereafter, ITT's shareholding interest in NEC was successively reduced until 1978 when it sold its remaining interest in 
the company. Today, NEC is one of the twenty-one principal member companies of the Sumitomo Group. In 1986, NEC was one of the largest manufacturers of communications systems and integrated circuits in Japan, and a leading 
producer of computers and industrial electronic equipment. NEC's products fall into four major categories: communications 
systems and equipment (accounting for thirty-two percent of consolidated net sales in 1986); computers and industrial electronic 
systems (thirty-six percent of net sales); electron devices (nineteen percent of net sales); and home electronics and other 
products (thirteen percent of net sales). NEC, which employs more than 89,000 permanent employees, operates more than fifty manufacturing plants in Japan and ten 
more overseas. The company sells its products through more than 200 domestic sales offices and more than 120 overseas 
offices situated in twenty-nine countries. In addition, it owns more than twenty non-consolidated subsidiaries throughout the 
world, including several in the United States. In the year ending March 31, 1986, NEC's consolidated net sales totaled more than 
$ 2 billion and its consolidated net income exceeded $ 27 million. Approximately thirty-three percent of these sales were to 
customers outside Japan. By any standard, NEC has achieved the status of a multinational corporation. See generally, M. 
Yoshino, Japan's Multinational Enterprises (1976)."
153,2," Three basic classes of personal computer monitors exist in the marketplace today. One class, known as the ""Amber/Green"" 
monitor, is useful for basic office computer functions such as word processing or numerical calculations, but has no real utility in 
situations demanding higher level graphics capability. A second class, the ""RGB"" (Red, Green, Blue) monitors, permits the use 
of computers in more graphically demanding situations, but remains limited in both color and resolution capability. Finally, the 
class of high resolution color monitors including the MultiSync is designed to perform the most complex graphics available, 
including ""EGA"" (Enhanced Graphic Applications), ""CGA"" (Color Graphic Applications), ""PGA"" (Professional Graphics 
Applications), and ""CAD/CAM"" (Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Manufacturing). Every high resolution color monitor must utilize a device known as a ""color board"" between the monitor and the computer. 
Different color boards exist for different computer applications, and until recently a user had to choose a separate compatible "
154,," monitor for each color board with which the user worked. According to plaintiffs' complaint, the MultiSync's uniqueness lies in its 
ability to automatically adjust to virtually all presently manufactured color boards, thus allowing the user to employ one monitor 
with a wide variety of boards. In addition, the MultiSync is likely to be compatible with future color boards as they become 
available on the market. See Complaint, paras. 10-18. Defendant NECHE-Japan manufactured the MultiSync monitors 
distributed by NECHE-USA to NCI."
154,3," The agreement provided that either party could terminate the distributorship ""without cause"" by giving the other party thirty (30) 
days written notice. It is uncontroverted that NECHE-USA gave NCI the proper notice."
154,4," Plaintiffs allege the following causes of action: (1) conspiracy to restrain trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust 
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1; (2) price discrimination in violation of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13; (3) monopolization in 
violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2; (4) violation of Section 73 of the Wilson Tariff Act of 1894, 15 U.S.C. § 
8; (5) violation of the Cartwright Act, California Business & Professions Code §§ 16720, 16722, 16726, 16727, 16750; (6) unfair 
competition; (7) interference with contractual relations; (8) interference with prospective advantage; (9) violation of franchise law; 
(10) breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (11) relief in the form of an order determining non-arbitrability. 
Complaint, August 27, 1986. "
156,5," Plaintiffs raise several evidentiary objections to Mr. Ohashi's declaration, including lack of competence, hearsay, and failure to 
execute the declaration in conformity with the California Code of Civil Procedure. Plaintiffs do not, however, articulate the 
reasoning behind their objections. According to his declaration, Mr. Ohashi served in several positions at NEC between 1965 
and 1985, including most recently as General Manager of NEC's International Planning Division. In May 1985, Mr. Ohashi left 
NEC and assumed his present position as NECHE-USA's president. From his long association with both NEC and NECHE-USA, 
Mr. Ohashi attests to personal knowledge of the NECHE-USA/NCI distributorship agreement. Accordingly, the Court finds that 
plaintiffs' competence and hearsay objections are without merit. Moreover, the Court finds that Mr. Ohashi's declaration was 
properly drafted and executed."
156,6," Plaintiffs argue that NEC subjected itself to the personal jurisdiction of this Court by issuing orders from Japan to NECHE-USA 
which resulted in the termination of NCI's distributorship. It is true, as the Ninth Circuit has noted, that ""[a] foreign act having an 
effect in the forum may satisfy the minimum contacts requirement"" for personal jurisdiction. Kramer Motors, Inc. v. British 
Leyland, Ltd., 628 F.2d 1175, 1178 (9th Cir. 1980). However, ""in each such case the defendant must have done some act by 
which it purposefully avails itself of the benefits and protections of forum law."" Id. Here, plaintiffs offer no evidence that NEC in 
fact was involved in the decision to terminate NCI's distributorship. Without such evidence, the Court may not sustain in 
personam jurisdiction on the basis of this single alleged act.  Scott, supra, 792 F.2d at 927. "
157,7," Plaintiffs rely heavily on the Supreme Court's recent decision in Asahi, supra. In Asahi, a specific jurisdiction case, a plaintiff 
injured in a motorcycle accident when the vehicle's tire and tube exploded filed a product liability action against, inter alia, the 
Taiwanese manufacturer of the tube. The tube manufacturer in turn cross-complained against the Japanese manufacturer of the 
valve stem assembly used in the tube. Id. at 1029. Other than manufacturing the valve stem incorporated into tubes ultimately 
used in California, the Japanese company had no other contacts with the forum state. The United States Supreme Court 
reversed a California Supreme Court decision upholding personal jurisdiction over the Japanese manufacturer. Eight Justices 
agreed that the exercise of jurisdiction over this party would violate the principles of fair play and substantial justice under the 
Fourteenth Amendment. Four Justices went further and argued that the mere placement of a product in the stream of 
commerce, without more, is not sufficient to confer jurisdiction over a foreign defendant even if it is aware that the stream will 
sweep the product into the forum state. Id. 1033 (O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.J., Powell, J., and Scalia, J.). Asahi does not directly apply in the present action since, as discussed above, plaintiffs have not demonstrated the prerequisites 
for specific jurisdiction. However, the case suggests generally that courts must apply a higher standard of review to the forum 
contacts of foreign defendants than they do to the contacts of domestic defendants. As Justice O'Connor, writing for the Court, 
notes: ""The unique burdens placed upon one who must defend oneself in a foreign legal system should have significant weight 
in assessing the reasonableness of stretching the long arm of personal jurisdiction over national borders."" Id. at 1034; accord 
United States v. First National City Bank, 379 U.S. 378, 404, 85 S. Ct. 528, 542, 13 L. Ed. 2d 365 (1965)(Harlan, J., 
dissenting)(""Great care and reserve should be exercised when extending our notions of personal jurisdiction into the 
international field""); Pacific Atlantic Trading Co. v. M/V Main Express, 758 F.2d 1325, 1330 (9th Cir. 1985) (""When the non-
resident defendant is from a foreign nation . . ., the sovereignty barrier is higher, undermining the reasonableness of 
jurisdiction""); Rocke v. Canadian Automobile Sport Club, 660 F.2d 395, 399 (9th Cir. 1981)(same). This Court is mindful of 
Justice O'Connor's admonition. Nevertheless, while ""litigation in a foreign jurisdiction is a burdensome inconvenience for any 
company, in the appropriate case, where defendant's activities abroad, either directly or through an agent, become widespread 
and energetic . . .' such litigation is 'part of the price which may be properly demanded of those who extensively engage in 
international trade.'"" Bulova Watch Co., Inc. v. K. Hattori & Co., Ltd., 508 F. Supp. 1322, 1334-35 (E.D.N.Y. 1981), quoting 
Frummer v. Hilton Hotels International, Inc., 19 N.Y.2d 533, 539, 281 N.Y.S. 2d 41, 45, 227 N.E. 2d 851, 854 (1967). "
158,8," In Helicopteros, Justice Blackmun contrasts the insufficient forum contacts of the Colombian corporation with what the Court 
determined to be adequate contacts of a foreign defendant in Perkins, supra. Helicopteros, supra, 466 U.S. at 414-15. In 
Perkins, the Supreme Court upheld general jurisdiction over a Philippine mining corporation which maintained an office in Ohio 
from which it conducted business, kept company files, held directors' meetings, carried on correspondence, issued paychecks 
drawn on two Ohio bank accounts, and engaged a local bank to act as its transfer agent.  Perkins, supra, 342 U.S. at 438. 
Perkins and Helicopteros appear to form a continuum upon which district courts can measure the sufficiency of a defendant's 
contacts with the forum state for personal jurisdiction purposes. Based on the evidence presented to date in the instant action, 
the Court believes that NEC's contacts with California fall somewhere midway between Perkins and Helicopteros on this 
continuum."
158,9," NEC Electronics, Inc. is a wholly-owned United States subsidiary of NEC. The company manufactures, imports, and sells 
electronics equipment bearing the ""NEC"" trademark for distribution throughout California. NEC Electronics employs 
approximately 400 workers at its manufacturing, assembly, and testing facility in Roseville, California. To date, the company has 
invested over $ 100,000,000 in its Roseville plant, and intends to employ 2,900 employees by the year 1990. Although NEC 
Electronic is not a party to the present action, its relationship with NEC may nevertheless form the basis of general jurisdiction 
over NEC.  Roorda v. Volkswagenwerk, A.G., 481 F. Supp. 868, 869-70 (D.S.C. 1979)(general jurisdiction over parent foreign 
corporation based on the contacts of the New Jersey corporation which was its ""sole importer,"" even though New Jersey 
corporation was dismissed from action). "
159,10," Defendants rely on Cannon and its progeny. For almost fifty years, Cannon has stood for the proposition that mere ownership 
of a subsidiary without more does not subject the foreign parent to the jurisdiction of the state in which the subsidiary transacts 
business. See e.g., State of Idaho v. Bunker Hill Co., 635 F.Supp 665, 670 (D. Idaho 1986); United States v. Bliss, 108 F.R.D. 
127, 131 (E.D. Mo. 1985); Williams, supra, 432 F. Supp. at 379; Westinghouse Electric Corp. v. Superior Court, 17 Cal.3d 259, 
274, 131 Cal. Rptr. 231, 551 P.2d 847 (1976). In Cannon, a North Carolina corporation brought a breach of contract action 
against both a marine corporation and the wholly-owned subsidiary it employed to market the parent company's products in 
North Carolina. Plaintiff effected service of process on the subsidiary but not on the parent corporation. Although the 
uncontested facts indicated that the parent in fact controlled and dominated the subsidiary, the Supreme Court held that since 
the two were formally separate corporate entities, and the separation was sufficiently ""real"", the state court could not assume 
personal jurisdiction over the parent corporation.  Id., 267 U.S. at 336-37. Numerous courts have gone to great lengths to distinguish or otherwise avoid the stringent principle announced in Cannon. See 
e.g., Brunswick Corp. v. Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd., 575 F. Supp. 1412, 1418-21 (E.D.Wis. 1983) (continuing validity of Cannon 
""doubtful"" in light of International Shoe); Consolidated Engineering Co., Inc. v. Southern Steel Co., 88 F.R.D. 233, 237-38 
(E.D.Va. 1980)(""Cannon is simply apposite to long-arm cases. The decision in Cannon was limited to an analysis of local service 
of process on a domestic subsidiary as a means of effecting process on an absent corporate parent""); Energy Reserves Group, 
Inc. v. Superior Oil Co., 460 F. Supp. 483, 502-03 (D. Kan. 1978) (speculating that only two narrow statutory applications of 
Cannon survive International Shoe); Roorda v. Volkswagenwerk, A.G., 481 F. Supp. 868, 877-81 (D.S.C. 1979) (""it seems 
apparent to this court, from multitudinous decisions of state and federal courts throughout the United States, that the principle 
announced by the Supreme Court in International Shoe, supra, changed the older concept of jurisdiction and substantially 
eroded the stringent jurisdiction test applied in [Cannon]""); see also Stoehr v. American Honda Motor Co. Inc., 429 F. Supp. 763, 
766 (D.Neb. 1977); W. Clay Jackson Enterprises v. Greyhound Corp., 431 F. Supp. 1229, 1232 (D.Puerto Rico 1977); Top Form 
Mills, Inc. v. Sociedad Nationale Industria Applicazioni Viscosa, 428 F. Supp. 1237, 1242, n. 1 (S.D.N.Y. 1977); Fisher v. First 
National Bank of Omaha, 338 F. Supp. 525, 529 (S.D.Iowa 1972) appeal dismissed, 466 F.2d 511 (1972). These and other 
modern courts have implicitly recognized that as the international economy becomes more interdependent, the formal but 
artificial separation between a foreign parent corporation and its domestic subsidiary becomes less compelling for purposes of 
determining personal jurisdiction. Moreover, with the increasing domination of the world economy by multinational corporations, 
it is appropriate to look to the parent company (i.e., the ""hub of the wheel"") when its subsidiaries (i.e., the ""spokes of the wheel"") 
violate substantive rights in foreign countries. See Bulova, supra, 508 F. Supp. at 1333-1345 (in-depth analysis of the 
relationship between personal jurisdiction and multinational corporations, including Japanese multinationals). The Court agrees 
with this trend in the law toward greater accountability by foreign corporate entities, and will accordingly look to the ""real"" rather 
than the ""formal"" relationship between NEC and its subsidiaries in deciding the jurisdiction issue.  Id. at 1340. "
160,11," Plaintiffs again rely heavily on Asahi, supra, this time to support their general jurisdiction argument. However, as discussed 
above, supra at footnote 5, Asahi is a specific jurisdiction case not directly applicable to the issue of general jurisdiction. 
Nevertheless, Justice O'Connor's plurality opinion in Asahi offers an important parallel to general jurisdiction cases. Justice 
O'Connor, writing for four Justices, identifies four examples of conduct in addition to placing a product into the stream of 
commerce which she considers sufficient to satisfy the requirements of due process in specific jurisdiction cases: ""Additional conduct of a defendant may indicate an intent or purpose to serve the market in the forum State, for example, 
designing the product for market in the forum State, advertising in the forum State, establishing channels for providing 
regular advice to customers in the forum State, or marketing the product through a distributor who has agreed to serve as 
the sales agent in the forum State."" Asahi, supra, 107 S. Ct. at 1033. Significantly, these factors are also relevant to determining whether or not general jurisdiction 
exists over a particular defendant. See e.g., Hirsch, supra, 800 F.2d at 1478 (relevant factors include whether the foreign "
161,," defendant makes sales, solicits or engages in business, or serves the forum state's markets); Wentling v. Popular Science Pub. 
Co., 176 F. Supp. 652, 659 (D.C. Pa. 1959); (foreign defendant's forum contacts in antitrust case included advertising and sales 
promotion campaigns); Brunswick, supra, 575 F. Supp. at 1419 (personal jurisdiction over parent corporations proper when 
parent companies systematically injected themselves into forum state's markets through subsidiary); Wells Fargo, supra, 556 
F.2d at 424 (personal jurisdiction over parent corporation proper where subsidiary acted as ""general agent"" of the parent). Here, 
plaintiffs have alleged the presence of each of these factors in the NEC-NEC Electronics relationship. And although plaintiffs' 
evidence is not sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction at this time, the Court considers these factors highly relevant to its 
final determination of the personal jurisdiction issue."
161,12," The Supreme Court has not yet considered the constitutionality of the national contacts theory of personal jurisdiction. See 
Asahi, supra, 107 S. Ct. at 1033 n **. (""We have no occasion here to determine whether Congress could, consistent with the 
Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, authorize federal court personal jurisdiction over alien defendants based on the 
aggregate of national contacts, rather than on the contacts between the defendant and the State in which the federal court sits."") "
162,13," 15 U.S.C. § 22 provides: District in which to sue corporation. Any suit, action, or proceeding under the antitrust laws against a corporation may be brought not only in the judicial district 
whereof it is an inhabitant, but also in any district wherein it may be found or transacts business; and all process in such 
cases may be served in the district of which it is an inhabitant, or wherever it may be found. This language parallels the wording in 15 U.S.C. § 78aa, used as the basis for personal jurisdiction in Securities Investor, supra 
at 1314 n.1."
162,14," Kramer expressly reserved the issue of whether national contacts theory applies in the antitrust context.  Kramer supra, 628 
F.2d at 1177 n. 4. "
163,15," The district court in NEC Electronics, Inc. v. Cal Circuit Abco, Inc., CV 85-1344-CBM, reversed on other grounds, 810 F.2d 
1506 (1987), found that NEC placed advertisements in periodicals circulated in the United States for the purpose of promoting 
the NEC trademark. The Court takes judicial notice of the unpublished proceedings of this case.  Valerio v. Boise Cascade 
Corp., 80 F.R.D. 626, 635, n. 1 (N.C. Ca. 1978), aff'd, 645 F.2d 699, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1126, 102 S. Ct. 976, 71 L. Ed. 2d 
113 (1981); 9 Wright & Miller, supra, Section 2410 at 359 (""the power of a court to take judicial notice of its own records is amply 
established by a multitude of cases"")."
163,16," Plaintiffs' evidence of NEC's ADR trading activity is included in Form 20-9 filed with the United States Securities and Exchange 
Commission on September 30, 1986 entitled ""Annual Report Pursuant to Section 13a or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934"". The Court takes judicial notice of this document.  Communications Satellite Corp. v. F.C.C., 198 U.S. App. D.C. 60, 611 
F.2d 883, 901 n. 31 (D.C. 1977) (judicial notice taken of publically filed documents). "
164,17," The only reported case which has considered the trading of ADRs as a factor in determining personal jurisdiction held that 
such transactions did not constitute a meaningful form of contacts with the forum state. Williams v. Canon, 432 F. Supp. 376, 
379 (C.D.Cal. 1977). Williams, however, only determined that these securities, which were traded in New York, were not 
relevant to establishing jurisdiction based on contacts with California. Id. It did not consider the issue posed in the present 
motion: i.e., whether or not trading ADRs in the United States constitutes a legitimate form of contacts with this country as a 
whole for jurisdiction purposes under the national contacts theory."
164,18," Plaintiff's evidence related to the United States government's determinations that NEC has sold televisions on the American 
market in violation of the Antidumping Act of 1921, as amended, 19 U.S.C. § 160(a), consists of several findings published in the 
Federal Register. See 36 Fed. Regis. 4597 (March 10, 1971); 48 Fed. Regis. 37596-37509 (August 18, 1983); and 50 Fed. 
Regis. 24278-24283 (June 10, 1985). The Court takes judicial notice of these findings pursuant to 44 U.S.C. Section 1507. In 
1985, NEC initiated litigation in federal court challenging the United States government's administrative findings in this matter. 
See NEC Corporation, supra, 622 F. Supp. at 1087."
164,19," HN26[
] California Code of Civil Procedure § 415.40 provides in relevant part: A summons may be served on a person outside this state in any manner provided by this article or by sending a copy of the 
summons and of the complaint to the person to be served by first-class mail, postage prepaid, requiring a return receipt."
164,20," HN27[
] Rule 4(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures provides in relevant part: ""Whenever a statute or rule of court of a state in which the district court is held provides (1) for service of a summons, or of 
a notice, or of an order in lieu of summons upon a party not an inhabitant of or found within the state, . . . service may . . . 
be made under the circumstances and in the manner prescribed in the statute or rule."" "
166,21," HN35[
] Rule 4(j) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides in relevant part: ""Summons: Time Limit for Service If a service of the summons and complaint is not made upon a defendant within 120 days after the filing of the complaint 
and the party on whose behalf such service was requried cannot show good cause why such service was not made within 
that period, the action shall be dismissed as to that defendant without prejudice upon the court's own intiative with notice to 
such party or upon motion . . ."
166,22," On the day plaintiffs filed this action, the Court granted their application for a Temporary Restraining Order. On September 8, 
1986, the Court stayed all proceedings in this action except for limited discovery pending arbitration of the termination issue. 
Properly, plaintiffs concluded that under the Court's order they were precluded from initiating service of process on NEC and 
NECHE-Japan. Then, on December 1, 1986, pursuant to plaintiff's request for clarification, the Court amended its September 8, 
1986, order to specifically allow service of process on the named defendants. On December 20, 1986, plaintiffs mailed the 
summons and complaint separately to NEC and NECHE-Japan. The return receipts indicate that NEC and NECHE-Japan each 
received these documents on December 23, 1986. "
167,23," HN37[
] 15 U.S.C. § 1 provides: Trusts, etc., in restraint of trade illegal; penalty ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any contract or 
engage in any combination or consipiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on 
conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding one million dollars if a corporation, or, if any other person, one 
hundred thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding three years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of 
the court."
167,24," This holding has been uniformly followed in this and other Circuits. See e.g., Lake Communications, Inc. v. ICC Corp., 738 
F.2d 1473, 1480 (9th Cir. 1984); Tunis Brothers Co. v. Ford Motor Co., 763 F.2d 1482, n. 20 (3rd Cir. 1985), vacated on other "
168,," grounds, 475 U.S. 1105, 106 S. Ct. 1509, 89 L. Ed. 2d 909 (1986); Hood v. Tenneco Texas Life Ins. Co., 739 F.2d 1012, 1015 
(5th Cir. 1984); Bryant Heating and Air Conditioning Corp. v. Carrier Corp., 597 F. Supp. 1045, 1048 (S.D.Fla. 1984)."
168,25," Plaintiffs argue that Copperweld should be limited to its facts. In that case, all alleged co-conspirators except a single parent 
corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary were exonerated of alleged antitrust activity following a jury trial. Id. at 757-58. 
Plaintiffs reason that Copperweld does not apply where, as in the present case, two ""sister subsidiaries"" are involved in the 
alleged conspiracy in addition to the parent corporation. For this proposition, plaintiffs cite Ray Dobbins Lincoln Mercury, Inc. v. 
Ford Motor Co., 604 F. Supp. 203 (W.D.Va. 1984). This Court finds that the facts of the present action are analogous to Copperweld and easily distinguishable from those in Ray 
Dobbins. In Ray Dobbins, plaintiffs brought a state law antitrust action against the Ford Motor Company and two of its wholly 
owned subsidiaries. Id. at 204. After the district Court had dismissed Ford Motor Company from the action, the two subsidiaries 
moved for dismissal based on the reasoning in Copperweld. Judge Turk denied the motion, concluding that: ""Defendants' reliance on Copperweld is ill-placed . . . as to any allegation of conspiracy between the two subsidiaries. Such 
a conspiracy in no way implicates the rejected intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine, which applies only where the parent is 
an alleged co-conspirator."" Id. at 205 (emphasis added). Unlike the situation in Ray Dobbins, the parent corporation here, NEC, remains an ""alleged co-
conspirator"" in the case and, according to plaintiffs' complaint, actually directed the conspiracy in which its subsidiaries allegedly 
participated. Indeed, plaintiffs make no allegations that NECHE-Japan and NECHE-USA engaged in any conspiratorial conduct 
apart from the activity involving NEC. Accordingly, the Court finds plaintiffs' argument to be without merit. "
170,26," HN47[

the discretion of the court. "
173,28," Plaintiffs have standing to sue under the Cartwright Act pursuant to HN57[
] C.C.P. § 16750, which provides in relevant part: Civil action; venue; damages; attorney fee; costs ""(a) Any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of anything forbidden or declared unlawful by 
this chapter, may sue therefor in any court having jurisdiction in the country where the defendant resides or is found, or any 
agent resides or is found, or where service may be obtained, without respect to the amount in controversy, and to recover 
three times the damages sustained by him or her, interest on his or her actual damages pursuant to Section 16761, and 
shall be awarded a reasonable attorneys' fee together with the costs of the suit. Such action may be brought by any person who is injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden or 
declared unlawful by this chapter, regardless of whether such injured person dealt directly or indirectly with the defendant."""
173,29," Plaintiffs rely on Louisiana Power & Light Co. v. United Gas Co., 493 So.2d 1149 (1986). In Louisiana Power & Light, the 
Louisiana Supreme Court interpreted that state's antitrust laws in light of Copperweld, duly noting that Copperweld ""should be 
persuasive influence on the interpretation of our own state enactment."" Id. at 1158. Notwithstanding this self-admonishment, 
however, the Louisiana high court held that: ""Louisiana's prohibition against contracts, combinations and conspiracies in restraint of trade does not except from its 
provisions unreasonable restraints of trade committed by a parent corporation and its partially or wholly owned subsidiary "
174,," corporation. In so holding we affirm this Court's earlier decision in Tooke & Reynolds v. Bastrop Ice & Storage Co., Inc., 
[172 La. 781, 135 So. 239 (1931)] and so interpret [the state's antitrust law] unpersuaded by the United States Supreme 
Court's recent interpretation of its counterpart anti-trust statute in Copperweld."" Id. at 1160. Louisiana Power & Light is not persuasive. The court in that case based its decision on established state caselaw which 
adopted a position contrary to that taken in Copperweld. Plaintiffs here do not cite, and this Court could not find, any 
comparable precedent in California law which would undermine the persuasive value of Copperweld in the present action."
174,30," California Business & Professions Code § 17203 provides: Injunction; ""Any person performing or proposing to perform an act of unfair competition within this state may be enjoined in any court 
of competent jurisdiction. The court may make such orders or judgments, including the appointment of a receiver, as may 
be necessary to prevent the use or employment by any person of any practice which constitutes unfair competition, as 
defined in this chapter, or as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any money or property, real or personal, 
which may have been acquired by means of such unfair competition."
174,31," HN61[
] California Business and Professions Code § 17535, provides in relevant part: Any person, corporation, firm, partnership, joint stock company, or any other association or organization which violates or 
proposes to violate this chapter may be enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction. The court may make such orders or 
judgments, . . . as may be necessary to prevent the use or employment by any person, corporation, firm, partnership, joint 
stock company, or any other association or organization of any practices which violate this chapter, or which may be 
necessary to restore to any person in interest any money or property, real or personal, which may have been acquired by 
means of any practice in this chapter declared to be unlawful. "
175,32," Plaintiffs rely on United Farm Workers of America v. Superior Court, 47 Cal.App.3d 334, 120 Cal. Rptr. 904 (1975). In United 
Farm Workers, the California Court of Appeals considered the range of relief available under Section 17535 and noted that even 
though this statute ""sound[s] in equity,"" a successful plaintiff may still recover ""damages if damages can be shown."" Id. at 344, 
citing People v. Superior Court (Jayhill Corp.), 9 Cal.3d 283, 107 Cal. Rptr. 192, 507 P.2d 1400 (1973). Although the Fletcher 
Court affirmatively cited United Farm Workers, a fair reading of the Court's opinion reveals the Justices' intention to limit 
""monetary relief"" to restitution instead of damages. Moreover, this reading of Fletcher is consistent with the interpretation given 
Section 17535 by the other courts. See, e.g.  Chern v. Bank of America, 15 Cal.3d 866, 875, 127 Cal. Rptr. 110, 544 P.2d 1310 
(1976) (""the applicable [state unfair competition] statutes do not authorize recovery of damages by private individuals""); Kates v. 
Crocker National Bank, 776 F.2d 1396, 1398 (9th Cir. 1985) (""California law does not recognize the recovery of damages by 
individuals for unfair business practices""); Meta-Film, supra, 586 F. Supp. at 1363 (monetary relief limited to restitution). "
207,1," The failure to prove predatory pricing is also fatal to Windmere's Section 1 claim against NVP. See Matsushita Electric 
Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (Section 1 case which alleged 
predatory pricing). "
209,2," Thus, we shall refer to USP, NAPC, and NVP collectively as ""Philips"" hereinafter."
209,3," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, the Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding precedent those decisions rendered by the former Fifth 
Circuit prior to October 1, 1981.  661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir. 1981). "
211,4, Average variable cost is the costs that vary with changes in output divided by the output.
211,5," International Air Industries suggests that a short-run profit-maximizing price is equal to average variable cost. If this is so, we 
fail to see how this additional test provides an alternative measure of predatory pricing other than to add the requirement of high 
entry barriers.  If the profit-maximizing price is actually intended to be something greater than average variable cost, we note that 
this test has been criticized by other courts and has not actually been imposed by any circuit. See, e.g., Southern Pacific 
Communications Co. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 556 F. Supp. 825, 964 (D.C. Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 470 
U.S. 1005, 84 L. Ed. 2d 380, 105 S. Ct. 1359 (1985). "
212,6," For purposes of this argument, we have considered 1985 advertising expenses to have been $ 17,558,000. This amount 
includes the $ 6.6 million contribution which, as noted previously, we believe should be deducted for purposes of this average 
variable cost analysis. However, because we wish to evaluate Windmere's arguments independently from one another, we have 
included this sum, as have all parties in reviewing this contention. "
220,1," The court, in assessing defendants' motion to dismiss, assumes as true the allegations in plaintiff's complaint. In presenting the 
plaintiff's version of the facts, the court expresses no opinion on the credibility of the facts and notes that defendants contest 
plaintiff's version of the facts. "
221,2," While plaintiff brings antitrust claims under both the Sherman and Clayton Acts, the court determines whether these claims fall 
within the extraterritorial reach of antitrust laws by reference to only the Sherman Act, as this is the typical manner in which 
""extraterritorial reach"" is analyzed. See Zenith Radio Corp. v. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., 494 F. Supp. 1161, 1164 (1980) "
222,," (""issues with respect to the extraterritorial application of American economic regulation are the same regardless of the particular 
statute being applied""). See also Chatham Condominium Ass'ns v. Century Village, Inc., 597 F.2d 1002, 1010 (5th Cir. 1979) 
(""jurisdictional scope of the Clayton Act is much narrower than that of the Sherman Act"")."
222,3," Other decisions have sought to modify the effects test by requiring analysis of international comity and other considerations. 
See e.g., National Bank of Canada v. Interbank Card Association, 666 F.2d 6 (2d Cir. 1982); Montreal Trading Ltd. v. Amax, Inc., 
661 F.2d 864, 869 (1981); Uranium Antitrust Litigation, 617 F.2d 1248 (7th Cir. 1980); Mannington Mills, Inc. v. Congoleum 
Corp., 595 F.2d 1287 (3d Cir. 1979); Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of America, N.T. & S.A., 549 F.2d 597 (9th Cir. 1976). See 
Areeda and Hovenkamp, ANTITRUST LAW 171-76 (1986 Supp.); ABA ANTITRUST SECTION, ANTITRUST LAW 
DEVELOPMENTS (2d ed. 1984). The Ninth Circuit in Timberlane, the most noted of these decisions, devised a three-part test 
for determining subject matter jurisdiction under the Sherman Act. ""The first part of this test requires 'that there be some effect -- 
actual or intended -- on American foreign commerce . . . .' The second part asks whether the alleged restraint is 'of such a type 
and magnitude so as to be cognizable as a violation of the Sherman Act?' The third part inquires: 'As a matter of international 
comity and fairness, should this extraterritorial jurisdiction of the United States be asserted to cover [the alleged restraint].'"" ABA 
ANTITRUST SECTION, ANTITRUST LAW DEVELOPMENTS 529-30 (2d ed. 1984). The court listed factors to be weighed in 
making the final, comity inquiry.  Timberlane 549 F.2d at 614. "
223,4," While the Export Act amends only the Sherman and Federal Trade Commission Acts and not the Clayton Act, the court applies 
the Act's ""extraterritorial reach"" guidelines to plaintiff's Clayton Act claim. See Areeda and Hovenkamp, ANTITRUST LAW 169 
(1986 Supp.) (""Given the evident purpose of the new statute . . . a court would find it difficult to take jurisdiction under Clayton 
Act § 7 over a venture that the new statute immunizes from the Sherman Act""); Zenith, 494 F. Supp. at 1178 (analyzed 
extraterritorial reach of Clayton Act under cases interpreting the Sherman Act). See also Chatham Condominium Ass'ns v. 
Century Village Inc., 597 F.2d 1002, 1010 (5th Cir. 1979) (""jurisdictional scope of the Clayton Act is much narrower than that of 
the Sherman Act""). "
224,5," An issue arises whether defendants' motion to dismiss the antitrust claim is an attack on the court's subject matter jurisdiction 
under Rule 12(b)(1) motion or an attack on the merits of the claim under Rule 12(b)(6). The law in some instances accords a 
differing degree of procedural protection to a plaintiff depending upon whether a court proceeds under 12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6): The basic difference among the various 12(b) motions is . . . that 12(b)(6) alone necessitates a ruling on the merits of the 
claim, the others deal with procedural defects. Because 12(b)(6) results in a determination on the merits at an early stage of 
plaintiff's case, the plaintiff is afforded the safeguard of having all its allegations taken as true and all inferences favorable to 
plaintiff will be drawn. The decision disposing [of] the case then is purely on the legal sufficiency of plaintiff's complaint: 
even were plaintiff to prove all its allegations, he or she would be unable to prevail. In the interests of judicial economy it is 
not improper to dispose of the claim at that stage. If the court considers matters outside the pleadings before it in a 12(b)(6) 
motion, the above procedure will automatically be converted into a Rule 56 summary judgment procedure. Here there are 
further safeguards for the plaintiff: in addition to having all of plaintiff's allegations taken as true, with all their favorable 
inferences, the trial court cannot grant summary judgment unless there is no genuine issue of material fact. The procedure under motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is quite different. At the outset we must 
emphasize a crucial distinction, often overlooked, between 12(b)(1) motions that attack the complaint on its face and 
12(b)(1) motions that attack the existence of subject matter jurisdiction in fact, quite apart from any pleading. The facial 
attack does offer similar safeguards to the plaintiff: the court must consider the allegations of the complaint as true. The 
factual attack, however, differs greatly for here the trial court may proceed as it never could under 12(b)(6) or Fed.R.Civ.P. 
56. Because at issue in a factual 12(b)(1) motion is the trial court's jurisdiction -- its very power to hear the case -- there is 
substantial authority that the trial court is free to weigh the evidence and satisfy itself as to the existence of its power to hear 
the case. In short, no presumptive truthfulness attaches to plaintiff's allegations, and the existence of disputed material facts 
will not preclude the trial court from evaluating for itself the merits of jurisdictional claims. Moreover, the plaintiff will have 
the burden of proof that jurisdiction does in fact exist. Chatham Condominium Ass'ns v. Century Village, Inc., 597 F.2d 1002, 1011-1012 (5th Cir. 1979) quoting Mortensen v. First 
Federal Savings & Loan Association, 549 F.2d 884, 891 (3d Cir. 1977). See Adams v. Bain, 697 F.2d 1213, 1219 (4th Cir. 
1982). HN6[
] The court should apply 12(b)(6) if the resolution of a motion requires a determination of the merits or if ""the jurisdiction 
facts are intertwined with the facts central to the merits of the dispute."" Adams, 697 F.2d at 1219. A difficult question arises 
whether the court in applying the ""effects test"" under the Sherman Act, as amended by the Export Act, is in fact reviewing the 
merits of an antitrust claim. Arguably, the effects test is a substantive element of an antitrust claim. Schematically, the Sherman Act parallels most statutes: 
a set of facts constitutes a claim provided that some other requirement is met.  Thus, a party can state a claim under rule 
10(b)(5) of the securities laws by satisfying the basic elements of a 10(b)(5) action, provided that the party bringing the action is 
purchaser or seller of stock. See Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723, 44 L. Ed. 2d 539, 95 S. Ct. 1917 
(1975). Under this view, a statutory proviso always represents a substantive limitation on the scope of meritorious claims, and a 
failure to allege facts sufficient to satisfy a statutory proviso equals a 12(b)(6) failure to state a claim. From this perspective, a 
failure to allege facts that, if proven, would satisfy the effects test should be treated as a failure to state a claim, not a lack of 
subject matter jurisdiction. While the former approach treats all statutory provisos as substantive elements of a claim, another approach looks at each 
proviso and ask whether the proviso sounds in procedure or substance. If the proviso presents a threshold obstacle lacking any 
resemblance to the core allegations of wrongdoing in the case, then the court properly can distinguish the procedural proviso 
from the substance of the case and proceed under 12(b)(1). The Export Act, as a proviso to the Sherman Act, requires a 
qualifying effect (i.e., on United States export trade) on a qualifying party (i.e., an exporter from the United States). Inquiry into 
whether a complaint satisfies such qualifications, at least in the instant case, is divorced from an inquiry into the allegations of 
wrongdoing. When the court asks whether the defendants' conduct had the requisite effect on United States export trade and 
whether plaintiff is a member of the class of United States exporters, the court is not looking at plaintiff's substantive allegations 
of illegal acts under the Sherman Act; the court rather is making a threshold jurisdictional determination. Under this view, the 
court would treat defendants' motion under 12(b)(1). "
225,," Prior to the enactment of the Export Act, most cases treated a contention that a party failed the effects test as an attack on the 
courts subject matter jurisdiction. Zenith Radio Corp. v. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., 494 F. Supp. 1161, 1171-1178, 1171 n.21 
(E.D. Penn. 1980). Moreover, all of the cases dismissing antitrust claims pursuant to the Export Act have treated the effects test 
as going to subject matter jurisdiction. See e.g.  Papst Motoren GMbH & Co. v. Kanematsu-Goshu (U.S.A.) Inc., 629 F. Supp. 
864, 868 (S.D.N.Y. 1986); Liamuiga Tours v. Travel Impressions, Ltd., 617 F. Supp. 920, 925; Eurim-Pharm v. Pfizer, 593 F. 
Supp. 1102, 1107 (S.D.N.Y. 1984). On the other hand, in a case prior to the Export Act, the Fourth Circuit applied 12(b)(6) to a 
contention that an antitrust complaint failed to allege a sufficient effect upon interstate commerce: Whether the complaint was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or failure to state a claim upon which relief could 
be granted is not clear. Since Congress specifically has conferred jurisdiction of Sherman Act claims (15 U.S.C. 15 & 26), 
we think it the better analysis to treat an insufficient plea of effect upon interstate commerce as a failure to state a claim 
upon which relief can be granted rather than lack of jurisdiction (in the sense of power) over the subject matter. Hospital Bldg. Co. v. Trustees of Rex Hospital, 511 F.2d 678, 681 (4th Cir. 1975) reversed on other grounds 425 U.S. 738, 48 L. 
Ed. 2d 338, 96 S. Ct. 1848 (1976). In Trustees of Rex Hospital, the Supreme Court appeared to agree with the Fourth Circuit 
that 12(b)(6) applied, but did not discuss the issue and stated that its analysis of the case would be ""no different . . . under 
12(b)(1)."" 425 U.S at 742 n.1. See also McLain v. Real Estate Board of New Orleans, 444 U.S. 232, 62 L. Ed. 2d 441, 100 S. Ct. 
502 (1980) (discussed interstate commerce element of Sherman Act in jurisdictional terms, but used 12(b)(6) terms in 
concluding that dismissal was improper). These cases addressed the interstate commerce requirement of an antitrust claim and 
not the requirement that foreign conduct have a certain effect on United States commerce. The better rule appears to be to treat such motions HN7[
] under 12(b)(1), unless the facts central to the merits -- i.e., the 
alleged wrongdoing forming the basis for asserting liability -- are intertwined with the jurisdictional facts. See Timberlane Lumber 
Co. v. Bank of America, 749 F.2d 1378 (9th Cir. 1984). In the instant case, the complaint is facially lacking in allegations 
sufficient to state a federal question under the Sherman Act. As previously discussed, a facial attack under 12(b)(1), in contrast 
to a factual attack, requires the court to assume as true the allegations contained within plaintiff's complaint. As such, while the 
court technically dismisses the case under 12(b)(1), plaintiff has received procedural safeguards commensurate with a 12(b)(6) 
motion. The court stresses, however, that if the court had been asked to make factual findings relevant to jurisdictional 
allegations (i.e., a factual attack), plaintiff would have more procedural protection under 12(b)(6) than under 12(b)(1). It is thus 
significant whether a court perceives itself as reviewing the merits of the case (i.e., 12(b)(6)) or a making a threshold jurisdiction 
determination (i.e., 12(b)(1))."
225,6," Although plaintiff filed a response to defendants' motion to dismiss, plaintiff did not include in its response any arguments 
specifically countering defendants' contentions that the section 75-1.1 claim is meritless. "
226,7," Commentators agree the North Carolina's unfair trade practices act ""grew out of antitrust laws"".  Lindner v. Durham Hosiery 
Mills, Inc., 761 F.2d 162, 165 (4th Cir. 1985). The Act's substantive provisions are ""reproduced verbatim from § 5 of the Federal 
Trade Commission Act (FTCA), 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(1)."" ITCO, 722 F.2d at 48. A violation of FTCA § 5 amounts to a violation of 
the Sherman Act; consequently, a violation of the Sherman Act violates North Carolina's unfair trade practices act. Id. "
227,8," Finally, the court notes the anomaly that would be created if section 75-1.1, a state statute, were construed to have a greater 
extraterritorial reach than the Sherman Act."
227,9," The court dismisses plaintiff's claim as not being within the contemplated reach of section 75-1.1. Arguably, the court could 
have dismissed the claim pursuant to North Carolina's choice of law rules, based on a finding that the facts dictate that French 
law, rather than North Carolina law, governs the occurrence in question. The North Carolina Supreme Court has not determined 
the appropriate test for deciding the applicable law when plaintiff raises a section 75-1.1 claim. The decisions interpreting North 
Carolina's choice of law rules are in conflict on whether to use the law of the jurisdiction where the last act occurred giving rise to 
injury (lex loci) or the jurisdiction having the ""most significant relationship"" to the occurrence giving rise to the claim.  Rockwool, 
640 F. Supp. at 1429-34 (1986) (most significant relationship); United Virginia Bank v. Air-lift Assoc., Inc., 79 N.C. App. 315, 339

afterward, all actions or suits in court of the following description:"

237,8," .  Actions of forcible entry and forcible detainer. After August 27, 1979, section 5526 read: HN3[
] There shall be commenced and prosecuted within two years after the cause of action shall have accrued, and not

239,6," Specifically, there is direct evidence showing that Ingraham threatened to buy equipment from other manufacturers if Noritsu 
sold a QSS unit to Pounds. The conclusion can also be inferred from the circumstantial evidence of the hostility of Elwinger to 
Pounds' Austin operations while he, Ingraham and McNaron were prospective business partners. "
240,7," Moreover, because Pounds Labs presented evidence of damages through an expert witness who was an economist (in the 
form of a study of what revenues Pounds Labs would have been able to obtain in the absence of the antitrust violations), we do 
not believe that sustaining the damage award will result in a miscarriage of justice. "
245,1," We also note here that in Appeal of German, relied upon by defendants, the Commonwealth Court, in concluding that the 
Corporation was not a private enterprise, said, in passing, that the members of its Board represented the City, the 
Commonwealth, Dauphin County, and other public interests.  27 Pa.Commw. at 108, 366 A.2d at 315. As noted above, this is no 
longer true. "
250,2," Of course, the reason why Vartan's plans were blocked was to prevent competition with the City's redevelopment plans. That 
""ulterior economic motive"" should play no part in the circumstances of this case when plaintiff and the municipality were 
engaging in the same business."
250,3," Plaintiff could argue it is not consistent for the courts to ignore specific claims of bad faith on the part of public officials merely 
because the procedures in place generally provide for adequate control and then rely upon the good faith of public officials in a 
specific instance when the procedures are inadequate. "
251,4," Vartan does assert we should consider the affidavits: (1) because they merely clarify and organize the affiants' testimony; (2) 
because defendants did not list the events of the August 24, 1984 meeting in their statement of material facts as to which there 
was no genuine issue to be tried, as required by Local Rule 401.4 and; (3) in the interest of justice.  Based upon Harsco, we 
reject the first and third reasons. Additionally, we fail to see why the second ground should permit introduction of the affidavits 
since defendants' argument concerning the August 24 meeting was briefed by defendants, with appropriate reference to 
deposition testimony in connection with their motion for summary judgment. In any event, the meeting was listed in defendants' 
statement of material facts in number 27.  While the details of the participants' discussion were not set forth, the pertinent ""fact"", 
from defendants' point of view was set forth there; i.e., that the participants had ""agreed"" that Vartan's property should be taken. "
252,5," Who took the initiative would appear to be immaterial in any event.  Regulated companies take the initiative in submitting 
proposed rates but that does not mean that the State does not maintain control over them. "
253,6," Vartan has also argued that Keisling fraudulently induced the agreement of the Mayor and Hammer but admits that there is no 
evidence concerning whether Keisling's representations to these public officials was true or false or made with the knowledge 
that they were false. Vartan argues that summary judgment is precluded to this extent. We believe, however, that Vartan had the 
duty of marshalling evidence on this issue at the time the summary judgment motion was made if he felt it was relevant. See 
Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). "

281,1," These different conclusions have led to unpredictable results. Compare Spence v. Flynt, supra, (case removed improvidently 
because jurisdiction was exclusive in the federal courts) with Karel v. Kroner, 635 F. Supp. 725 (N.D. Ill. 1986) (plaintiff barred 
from raising his RICO claim in federal court because he failed to raise it under concurrent jurisdiction, in state court)."
281,2," See Hmk Corp v. Walsey, 637 F. Supp. 710 (E.D. Va. 1986); Karel v. Kroner, 635 F. Supp. 725 (N.D. Ill. 1986); Chas. Kurz

jurisdiction see Loo and Kubo Concurrent Jurisdiction For Civil RICO, California Lawyer, June, 1987, at 81. "
282,3," It should be noted that the district court in County of Cook v. Midcon Corporation, supra, had found in favor of exclusive 
jurisdiction in the federal courts, 574 F. Supp. 902 (N.D. Ill. E.D. 1983). Its ultimate decision was affirmed by the Court of 
Appeals without ruling upon that jurisdictional issue. "
283,4," In Sedima S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 105 S. Ct. 3275, 87 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1985), the court cited statistics showing 
that 37% of the 270 cases known at the time of the survey involved common law fraud in a commercial or business setting.  87 
L. Ed. 2d at 361, n.16. "
284,5," Bryant v. Ford Motor Co., 794 F.2d 450 (9th Cir. 1986), was withdrawn by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on May 29, 
1987, pending a rehearing by the en banc court."
284,6," This information is not so extensive however, as to demonstrate to the court that plaintiff was aware of the specific identity of 
the alleged Does. "
289,1," Complaint paras. 19-23, 42, 54, 61, 67. As to the state claims, however, plaintiff alleges conduct extending beyond the March 
15, 1984 date. See Complaint paras. 49, 50, 56, 64, 72. "
291,2," The parties do not argue, and this Court does not decide, whether the 1984 Act retroactively imposes new standards of 
conduct or severer penalties, in the manner of an ex post facto law. Plaintiff alleges conduct violating sections 1 and 2 of the 
Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 2. Defendants argue that this conduct is proscribed by various sections of the 1984 Act. See 
Defendants' Joint Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion to Dismiss 7-9. Far from objecting to application 
of the new statute, defendants assert that it controls this action. "
292,3," In Johnson Products the district court dismissed plaintiff's Shipping Act claim for failure to state a claim because the allegations 
of fraud and negligence did not fall within the substantive provisions of either the 1916 Shipping Act or its 1984 replacement.  
Johnson Products, 619 F. Supp. at 766. The court's remark that the 1984 Act applies ""only to conduct occurring after March 
20, 1984"" was thus only a dictum. The court's statement may be intended to reflect the fact that the complaint before it, which 
was filed in January 1985, arguably qualified under the saving provision of § 1719(e)(2)(B). Most importantly, the statement is 
set forth without analysis. For the reasons discussed in the text below, the Court declines to follow the Johnson Products dictum."
292,4," In fact, the restriction of § 1719(e)(2) to ""suits"" itself represented a narrowing of the exemptions provided by an earlier version 
of the 1984 Act, S. 1460, which would have exempted from the new Shipping Act ""any rights and duties that matured, penalties 
that were incurred or proceedings that were commenced before the date of enactment of this Act."" See California Cartage Co. v. 
Pacific Maritime Assn., 23 S.R.R. 420, 423-24 (FMC 1985), aff'd, 802 F.2d 353 (9th Cir. 1986). "
293,5," A court is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision, unless to do so would result in ""manifest injustice."" 
Bradley v. Richmond School Board, 416 U.S. 696, 711, 40 L. Ed. 2d 476, 94 S. Ct. 2006 (1974). A determination of manifest 
injustice rests on three considerations: ""(a) the nature and identity of the parties, (b) the nature of their rights, and (c) the nature 
of the impact of the change in law upon those rights."" Id. at 717; see also Thorpe v. Housing Authority of Durham, 393 U.S. 268, 
21 L. Ed. 2d 474, 89 S. Ct. 518 (1969); United States v. The Schooner Peggy, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 103, 2 L. Ed. 49 (1801). The FMC has determined that the applicability of the 1984 Act under the Bradley criteria is to be decided on a case-by-case 
basis under the facts of a given proceeding. See Notice: Application of Shipping Act of 1984 to Formal Proceedings Pending 
Before Federal Maritime Commission on June 18, 1984, 49 Fed. Reg. 21,798 (1984), 22 S.R.R. 976 (1984). "
294,6," The parties have cited the Court to numerous cases construing section 108 of the Bankruptcy Code. These cases demonstrate 
a clear trend of applying section 108(a) to toll statutes of limitation in appropriate circumstances. None of these cases holds that 
section 108(a) operates to extend jurisdictional limitations. See, e.g., In re Greenwald, 48 Bankr. 263, 273 (S.D.N.Y. 1984) (state 
statute of limitation bar under Virginia law); In re L.A. Clarke & Son, Inc., 59 Bankr. 856, 857 (Bankr. D.C.C. 1986) (no statute of 
limitation bar under Virginia law); In re Jackson, 42 Bankr. 76, 84 (Bankr. D.D.C. 1984) (state law usury claim not time-barred); 
In re Ward, 42 Bankr. 946, 950 (Bankr. M.D. Tenn. 1984) (§ 108(a) extension inapplicable to extend limitation period for 
enforcement of judgment lien because cause of action unrelated to debtor's claim); Matter of Lauderdale Motorcar Corp., 35 
Bankr. 544, 549-50 (Bankr. S.D. Fla. 1983) (§ 108(a) inapplicable because right to protest non-renewal of dealer agreement not 
an ""action"" within meaning of statute; dictum that debtor's failure to protest non-renewal within 90 days left state agency without 
jurisdiction to act); In re Radcliffe's Warehouse Sales, Inc., 31 Bankr. 827, 830-32 (Bankr. W.D. Wash. 1983) (§ 108(a) 
unavailable to extend state statute of limitation in action by trustee based on creditors' rights); In re Reliable Drywall, Inc., 20 
Bankr. 386, 387 (Bankr. D. Ariz. 1982) (§ 108(a) extends statute of limitation in action to foreclose on property encumbered by 
debtor's mechanic's lien). The legislative history of section 108(a) suggests that Congress viewed the statute as establishing a limited tolling of statutes of 
limitation for causes of action belonging to the bankruptcy estate. See H.R. Rep. No. 595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 318, reprinted in 
1978 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 5963, 6275 (""Subsection (a) extends any statute of limitation for commencing or continuing 
an action by the debtor . . . ."")."
294,7," While the parties agree that section 108(a) can, in appropriate circumstances, operate to extend a statute of limitation in favor 
of the estate, they dispute whether it is similarly applicable to a jurisdictional provision. Plaintiff does not offer, and the Court has 
not found, authority for the latter proposition. See supra note 6. The Court declines to create such a rule in the context of this "
295,," case, involving as it does construction of a statute whose legislative history reveals a clear congressional concern with divesting 
federal courts of parallel jurisdiction over maritime antitrust matters. "
300,1," Except for the identities of the defendants and co-conspirators named, the Amended Complaint in State of New York v. Cedar 
Park, et al., 85 Civ. 1887, and the complaint in State of New York v. Century-Maxim Construction Corp., et al., 85 Civ. 8128, are 
virtually identical. "
304,2," It is interesting to note that both Sells and Doe were decided over bitter dissents. Indeed, three members of the Sells majority, 
including Justice Brennan, the author of Sells, dissented in John Doe. Only Justice Stevens was in the majority in both cases."
304,3," In defendants' recent letter to the Court, they request an evidentiary hearing to explore, among other things, the procedures 
used to segregate attorneys and information within the Attorney General's office. See Letter of Michael Feldberg, Esq. (May 5, 
1987). The request is denied. "
306,4," We make this observation taking into account our dismissal of the treble damages claims asserted on behalf of unidentified 
political subdivisions. "
320,1," The Midcal requirement was recently reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in the case of 324 Liquor Corp. v. Duffy, 479 U.S. 335, 
107 S. Ct. 720, 93 L. Ed. 2d 667 (1987). The Duffy court held that a New York statute purporting to authorize per se illegal 
combinations by private actors, in violation of the Sherman Act, was void, and was preempted by the Sherman Act. Id. See also 
Fisher v. City of Berkeley, holding that a state statute allowing a municipality, as opposed to a private party, the right to impose 
rent ceilings on residential real property was not preempted because it was not facially inconsistent with the Sherman Act. 475 
U.S. 260, 106 S. Ct. 1045, 89 L. Ed. 2d 206 (1986). But the court also held that: There may be cases in which what appears to be a state - or municipality - administered price stabilization scheme is really 
a private price-fixing conspiracy, concealed under a 'gauzy cloak of state involvement,' . . . This might occur even where 
prices are ostensibly under the absolute control of government officials . . . we have been given no indication that such 
corruption has tainted the rent controls imposed by Berkeley's Ordinance . . . the Ordinance can hardly be viewed as a 
cloak for any conspiracy among landlords or between the landlords and the municipality . . . Id. at 1051 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs' complaint in this case alleges exactly the type of price-fixing 
recognized by the Fisher court as being distinguishable and outside of the protection afforded by Fisher. "

Laws? I N.Y.S. Bar J. (Nov. 1985) II N.Y.S. Bar J. (Dec. 1985); Stewart, Supreme Court Report: Suing Local Governments, 71

of Hallie v. City of Eau Claire . . .], 25 Washburn L. J. 358 (1986). "
341,1," The jury appeared to have derived one of the damage awards from the wrong damages exhibit, and the District Court reduced 
this award to reflect the correct amount. Eden did not resist Ryko's j.n.o.v. motion with respect to the attempted monopolization 
claim. J.A. 799. "
343,2," Sight-draft sales to non-NAP designated customers clearly fall outside the NAP pricing structure. Eden was free to charge 
whatever price the market would bear on these types of transactions, and they therefore are irrelevant to our analysis of the 
resale price maintenance claim. "
344,3," This is more than a mere paper formality; Ryko uses the NAP purchase order as collateral for operational financing, relying on 
the creditworthiness of the major oil company buyers to secure loans approaching the face value of the purchase orders. Tr. 
453."
344,4," Ryko ships goods sold under the NAP in the name of the purchaser, FOB Des Moines, which means that the ultimate 
purchaser, rather than Eden, is legally responsible for the goods during shipment. See Iowa Code §§ 554.2319, 554.2401, 
554.2509. However, Eden demonstrated that in practice Ryko requires its distributors to take responsibility for minor shipping 
damage. See, e.g., Ex. R-4, U-4, Tr. 1446-49. Similarly, although the distributorship contract requires Eden to maintain liability 
insurance covering the machines and Eden's installation and service work, Eden admitted that Ryko has not strictly enforced the 
provision. Tr. 1109. Moreover, it is unclear whether Eden could be held legally responsible for damage caused by a machine to 
which Eden never holds title, and Eden has presented no evidence that it actually purchased the insurance coverage."
344,5," In Greene, the court suggested that one of the central issues in applying Simpson to the facts of that case was to decide ""who 
was a customer of whom."" 517 F.2d at 655. Indeed, the District Court here submitted the Simpson inquiry to the jury in exactly 
the same terms. Jury Instruction 19. Ryko has not objected to the form of this instruction, and because of our view of the 
evidence, we need not decide whether the instruction constitutes plain error. However, we note that the instruction seriously 
misstates the law and would be grounds for reversal if Ryko had objected to the form and content of the instruction, rather than 
relying solely on its objections regarding the sufficiency of the evidence. Simpson clearly directs our attention to the economic 
risks involved in the transactions, not to an ambiguous inquiry regarding the loyalties of the ultimate consumer. To instruct a jury 
to conduct a Simpson inquiry by deciding whose customers belong to whom is to invite the jury to speculate about personal 
relationships between the parties, and to draw conclusions based solely on evidence regarding promotional efforts, rather than 
on the actual assumption of economic risk. A jury reasonably could conclude, if put to the choice, that buyers of products from a 
manufacturer's sales representative were ""customers"" of the representative, rather than of his employer. Indeed, if the sales "
345,," representative were to change employers, many of his former customers might be expected to continue to do business with him 
and to begin ordering goods from the representative's new supplier. However, as a matter of antitrust law, both of the 
representative's employers would be equally free to set the price at which he sold their goods, regardless of whether the ultimate 
buyers might be considered ""customers"" of the representative. "
346,6," In a sales proposal to a Gulf Oil Company district office, Eden referred to one prior sale in which it accepted a purchase order 
from Gulf covering the equipment, construction, plumbing and electrical work involved in the installation of a Ryko machine. Ex. 
4; Ex. DDD. In the letter, Eden requests that the purchase order for the latest proposal be separated into its various components 
(and that the order for the machine be made out directly to Ryko) to relieve Eden ""of the burden of financing the project up front, 
as we did for the Columbia project . . . ."" Ex. 4. The letter makes clear that Eden did not wish to make a practice of providing 
such financing for the customer. Significantly, on the sale proposed in the letter, Ryko extended 30-day credit to Eden, thus 
relieving Eden of the responsibility of issuing a sight draft for delivery of the equipment before Eden received payment from the 
customer. Eden assured Ryko that ""normal bid and contract procedures"" would be followed on the next sale. Ex. 14. Given 
Eden's own characterization of such financing as an exception, we do not believe this single instance should be significant in our 
analysis of the entire economic relationship."
346,7," Although Eden produced two invoices purporting to show that Ryko had delivered machines directly to Eden for installation at 
other locations, neither of these sales were to NAP customers. Ex. E-8, F-8. One of the sales was to a previous NAP customer, 
but the customer had been removed from the NAP approximately a year before the sale, and Ryko no longer required its 
distributors to give the customer NAP pricing. Ex. H-2."
346,8," Ryko objected only to the sufficiency of the evidence on the proof of an antitrust agreement, and we therefore are extremely 
limited in our review of the instruction regarding the required finding. See Denniston v. Burlington Northern, Inc., 726 F.2d 391, 
393 (8th Cir. 1984) (citing Board of Water Works Trustees v. Alvord, Burdick & Howson, 706 F.2d 820, 824 (8th Cir. 1983)). We 
do not believe that, as a matter of Iowa law, the jury was the proper interpreter of Eden's legal obligations under the 
distributorship contract. See, e.g., Farm Bureau Mutual Ins. Co. v. Sandbulte, 302 N.W.2d 104, 107-08 (Iowa 1981). However, "
347,," because of our view of the evidence, we need not decide whether submitting the interpretation of the NAP contract provisions to 
the jury constituted plain error."
347,9," The instructions allowed the jury to find that Ryko had conspired with the final consumers to fix prices. Special Interrogatory 
5(a), which the jury answered in the affirmative, asked the jury whether Ryko had agreed with ""its distributors and/or its national 
account customers to fix the resale prices of Ryko's car washing equipment."" Again, we are faced with an instruction to which no 
objection was raised, but which does not state the law. We do not agree with the suggestion that a supplier may be found to 
have conspired with the consumer to fix resale prices. Compare Rea v. Ford Motor Co., 497 F.2d 577, 590-91 & n.29 (3d Cir.), 
cert. denied, 419 U.S. 868, 95 S. Ct. 126, 42 L. Ed. 2d 106 (1974). Ryko is perfectly free to fix a price for its products and to 
solicit sales at that price without incurring antitrust liability.  Dunn v. Phoenix Newspapers, Inc., 735 F.2d 1184, 1187-88 (9th Cir. 
1984). ""There is an obvious agreement between [a supplier] and its direct customer, the buying consumer. But such omnipresent 
agreements are not resale price restraints."" P. Areeda, VII Antitrust Law para. 1451(f) (1986). However, because we hold that 
Eden did not produce sufficient evidence to demonstrate a conspiracy between Ryko and its NAP customers regarding the price 
for machines sold by sight draft, we need not address as plain error the validity of Eden's theory that Ryko may be found liable 
for entering into such an agreement with the ultimate consumer."
347,10," The provisions of Eden's distributorship contract (Ex. 1) dealing with the NAP are as follows: IV.  PRICE AND CREDIT STRUCTURE. . . . . E.  Pricing structures for all major oil companies and national accounts shall be determined by the Company [Ryko]. 
Accounts may be declared national accounts at the Company's discretion. . . . . G.  Purchase orders issued from major oil companies or national accounts headquarters will be issued in the name of the 
Company and shall be sent directly to the Company. H.  Purchase orders issued from major oil companies or national accounts headquarters shall not require a deposit and 
goods concerned will not be shipped on a sight draft. I.  Billing of purchase orders issued by major oil compan[ies] or national account headquarters will be handled by the 
Company. Commissions on said accounts will be paid to the Distributor upon collection of the purchase order price. "
348,11," See footnote 9, supra. "
349,12," Although Eden's contract designates only the District of Columbia and Maryland as Eden's exclusive territory, Eden's claim to 
distribution rights in certain portions of northern Virginia is a part of this lawsuit."
349,13," This practice is known as dual distribution. The term is useful here only in discussing Ryko's sales to its distributors for their 
own account. As discussed earlier, for antitrust purposes the distributors act as Ryko's agents in making NAP sales. "
350,14," Nothing in NCAA v. Board of Regents, 468 U.S. 85, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70, 104 S. Ct. 2948 (1984), or FTC v. Indiana Federation of 
Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1986), is to the contrary. In those cases, the Supreme Court 
observed in the context of horizontal combinations that ""the absence of proof of market power does not justify a naked restriction 
on price or output."" 468 U.S. at 109-10; see also 106 S. Ct. at 2018-19. The vertical restrictions at issue here obviously do not 
involve a ""naked"" attempt to restrict output or raise prices. Rather, they are ""'ancillary' restraints, those that are part of a larger 
endeavor whose success they promote."" Polk Bros., Inc. v. Forest City Enterprises, 776 F.2d 185, 188-89 (7th Cir. 1985). It is 
true that ""'proof of actual detrimental effects, such as a reduction of output' can obviate the need for an inquiry into market 
power, which is but a 'surrogate for detrimental effects.'"" Indiana Federation, 106 S. Ct. at 2019 (quoting VII P. Areeda, Antitrust 
Law para. 1511, at 429 (1986)). However, unless the plaintiff can demonstrate an ""actual detrimental effect"" on competition 
(which in a meaningful sense demonstrates the defendant's market power), the threshold market power requirement mitigates 
an otherwise ""unlimited inquiry necessary under the rule of reason."" Assam, 798 F.2d at 316. Here, Eden's own witness 
admitted that he had no evidence that the territorial restrictions had any impact on market price or output. Tr. 1728-29."
350,15," There was ample evidence from which the jury could conclude that the various car-wash systems were essentially 
interchangeable in the eyes of consumers and that the systems formed one relevant product market. Tr. 2060-64. Eden's expert 
witness gave testimony regarding the distinct markets served by the various kinds of equipment and argued that rollovers, tunnel 
washes, and wand systems were not competitive substitutes for one another. However, on cross-examination, the same witness 
volunteered, without being asked, that locating the three types of systems in close proximity to one another ""would have been a 
bad marketing decision."" Tr. 1717. The jury could have concluded that if the three systems comprised distinct product markets 
and truly were not in competition with each other, then their proximity should not have any effect on their profitability. "
351,16," The parties did not extensively address the Section 1 claim in this appeal, but our resolution of the Clayton Act claim disposes 
of the issue. HN21[
] If a contract is not prohibited by ""the broader proscription of § 3 of the Clayton Act it follows that it is not 
forbidden by those of the [Sherman Act]."" Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320, 335, 5 L. Ed. 2d 580, 81 S. 
Ct. 623 (1961). "
352,17," Indeed, the overall effect on interbrand competition in such cases may be beneficial by focusing the distributor's efforts on one 
product line and, in turn, removing the ""free rider"" threat to the manufacturer's own selling efforts. Where, as here, the 
manufacturer engages in promotional activity that is designed to dovetail with the distributor's efforts, an exclusive dealing clause 
guarantees that the manufacturer's marketing investment will not be lost to other firms when the distributor makes his sales 
presentation to potential buyers. This assurance encourages the manufacturer's investment in marketing activity, and thus 
encourages interbrand competition. That Ryko's concern over its investment in marketing was legitimate is aptly illustrated by 
Eden's attempt to sell its reclaim by comparing Ryko's unfavorably to its own. Tr. 1001, 1025-26."
352,18," Ryko repeatedly offered Eden updated contracts containing less restrictive exclusivity provisions, but Eden refused to sign the 
newer versions, in part because it preferred the protection offered by the more restrictive exclusive dealing and exclusive 
territories provisions of the contract it already had. Tr. 362-66, 1164-65, 1327-29. "
353,19," Eden suggests that approximately 63% of its car-wash machine sales during 1982 and 1983 required a reclaim. Because this 
percentage is based on Eden's sales of Ryko rollover equipment, we have no way of knowing what percentage of the total car-
wash market requires a reclaim system. Moreover, the ""one-stop shopping"" argument clearly applies only to buyers who 
purchase the accessories as original equipment. Buyers who decide to purchase additional equipment to upgrade previously 
installed car-wash machines -- for example, a water reclaim purchased to comply with a newly enacted local ordinance -- are 
free to purchase such accessories from manufacturers who do not offer a full line of equipment. In addition, Eden's testimony 
confirms that local regulations increasingly require reclaim systems. Tr. 1773. To the extent that this regulatory trend affects 
existing wash sites, the demand for separately purchased reclaim units can be expected to increase. This would, in turn, 
decrease the relative level of foreclosure in the entire market caused by foreclosure with respect to original equipment buyers. In 
these circumstances, there is insufficient evidence from which to conclude how much of the accessory market, if any, is actually 
foreclosed. "
354,20," Our disposition of the antitrust claims necessarily requires a reversal of the District Court's award of attorney fees to Eden 
under Section 4 of the Clayton Act."
354,21," Eden claims that Ryko made fraudulent misrepresentations to Eden in five different respects: (1) That Ryko was committed to building a strong network of distributors; (2) That Ryko would not establish competing distributors in Eden's territory; (3) That Eden could market and install non-Ryko water reclaim systems; (4) That Eden could sell, install and service Ryko equipment in Virginia; and (5) That the distributor price for Ryko products [would] allow a 30% margin for the distributor. Jury Instruction 14. Special Interrogatory 4, which the jury answered in the affirmative, asked simply whether Ryko had 
defrauded Eden. The Interrogatory makes no reference to and requires no findings regarding any of the individual theories of 
fraud. The fraud verdict thus is a general verdict, even though it took the form of an answer to a special interrogatory. "
363,1," At this stage of the proceedings, I draw all reasonable inferences in favor of Tanol.  See generally Williams, 784 F.2d at 433. I 
note, however, that should Panasonic move for summary judgment, Tanol will bear the burden of coming forward with some 
evidence showing that Panasonic falls within the ambit of the Act.  See M.G.L. c. 93, § 3; Celotex v. Catrett, 106 S.Ct. 2548 
(1986). "
366,2," While in the complaint Tanol styles this cause of action ""intentional interference with advantageous business relationships,"" the 
company's memorandum makes clear that it is referring to the tort more commonly known as ""interference with contractual 
relations."" "

386,9," The Commission discussed this allocation and classification of fixed costs at greater length in the Texas Eastern Transmission 
Corp. order, see supra note 9. The Commission reasoned: In the unregulated competitive world, profits are earned and maximized only if the business manages its operations 
efficiently and is capable of reading and acting upon price signals to determine the appropriate level of customer demand. 
As we move to increasing competition in the gas pipeline industry, there is no economic reason to assure pipeline profits 
where sales are not made. If equity return and associated taxes are included in the commodity component to be recovered 
over annual throughput, Texas Eastern will earn profits only when it makes sales and transports gas and will maximize its 
earnings by meeting and exceeding its volume projections. This classification of profits holds the pipeline responsible for its 
management decisions and provides necessary incentive to Texas Eastern to purchase gas both at the quantity and at the 
price demanded by its customers. We will therefore adopt a modified fixed variable methodology . . . in which the full equity 
return and associated taxes are at risk in the commodity charge of Texas Eastern's rates. "

401,*," The Honorable Patrick A. Conmy, Chief Judge for the District of North Dakota, sitting by designation. "
402,1," By stipulation, the parties agreed to try the Sherman Act claims solely on a per se theory. Accordingly, Lomar must show that 
as a matter of law it has alleged one or more Sherman Act violations falling within the narrow per se category, and that there are 
disputes of fact material to the resolution of its claims under the per se rule. Absent such a showing, summary judgment was 
appropriate, regardless of any disputed issues of fact that would be relevant to claims properly evaluated under the rule of 
reason. Cf.  McCabe's v. La-Z-Boy Chair Co., 798 F.2d 323, 329 (8th Cir. 1986), petition for cert. filed, 55 U.S.L.W. 3495 (Dec. 
29, 1986). "
404,2, Lomar was reinstated as a Chicago Dietetic distributor in 1980. 
405,3," Although the present statute of limitations contained in 15 U.S.C. § 15(b) did not apply to the action in Hanover, the court's 
disposition of United Shoe's arguments with respect to the issue is instructive. If the futility of Hanover's demand during the 
statutory period were a complete answer to both the standing and the statute of limitations questions, the court's separate 
discussion of the latter would not have been necessary. "
408,4," As both Northwest Wholesale Stationers and Indiana Federation of Dentists should make clear, our conclusion that some 
horizontal concert of action is necessary in this context does not imply that it is sufficient to justify application of the per se rule. 
In both of those cases, the Supreme Court held that concerted refusals to deal by horizontal combinations should be examined 
under the rule of reason rather than the per se rule. Northwest Wholesale Stationers, 472 U.S. at 298; Indiana Federation of 
Dentists, 106 S. Ct. at 2018. "
411,5," Competitive justifications for dealer-inspired restraints may be equally applicable to cases, like the present one, where the 
dealer allegedly has requested similar restraints from several suppliers. Where the plaintiff alleges a combination between the 
suppliers, as in Klor's, an element of horizontal collusion is present, which more strongly suggests a predominantly 
anticompetitive intent and impact. In these circumstances, our experience warrants application of the per se rule. Cf.  Broadcast 
Music, Inc., 441 U.S. at 9. However, where there is no horizontal combination, separate conspiracies between the dealer and 
each of the various suppliers should be evaluated individually. While a series of dealer-inspired refusals to deal may signal the 
dealer's anticompetitive intent, they may be equally indicative of an efficiency-related justification for the requested refusals. The 
same types of intrabrand restraints, such as limited or exclusive distributorships, may be especially appropriate where, as here, 
the products and the markets in which they are sold are extremely similar. Accordingly, Lomar's argument in favor of the per se 
rule is not bolstered by its allegation that GF requested more than one supplier to refuse to deal with Lomar; each refusal is 
subject to rule-of-reason analysis."
411,6," Lomar argues that Dieter's never intended to create an exclusive distributorship with GF, and that rule-of-reason analysis 
therefore is inappropriate. Clearly, the distinction between restraints subject to per se analysis and those analyzed under the rule 
of reason should not depend upon specific contractual terms granting an exclusive distributorship or franchise, see Westman 
Comm'n Co., 796 F.2d at 1225, for this is to give economic significance to the mere labels which the parties attach to their 
agreements. More significantly, Lomar's argument confuses the rationale for applying the rule of reason with the types of 
restraints to which the rule applies. We apply the rule of reason to exclusive distributorships and vertical refusals to deal 
because they are not almost always certain to have predominantly anticompetitive effects (and therefore should not be 
condemned as being per se unlawful), not because their impetus and structure are identical. "
412,7," Lomar makes much of the District Court's observation that ""a jury could reasonably find that GF and Art Stone had a goal of 
eliminating or weakening Lomar as a competitor."" Lomar I, 627 F. Supp. at 111. We therefore should note at the outset that the 
predatory intent required under this prong of the Henry v. Chloride test is broader than an intent to undermine a particular 
competitor; it must relate to the market as a whole. As we observed in Henry, a showing of GF's predatory intent with regard to 
Lomar alone ""only circles back to the injury-to-a-single-competitor standard and is inadequate in light of our decisions."" 809 F.2d 
at 1343 n.8."
412,8," In light of Lomar's own deposition testimony mentioning at least three other specialty food distributors in the Iowa market, the 
assertion clearly lacks credibility. IV App. at 56-57. However, the District Court evaluated Lomar's claims in the context of a 
motion for summary judgment, and therefore was restricted in making such credibility determinations. We are similarly restricted 
in our review of the evidence, and therefore assume arguendo that Lomar and GF are the only significant competitors currently 
in the market. "
413,9," The District Court rejected Lomar's original definition of the product market as consisting solely of specialty foods distribution. In 
response to a subsequent order from the District Court seeking an acceptable definition, Lomar asserted that no market 
definition was required, because Lomar had shown injury to itself through below-cost pricing by GF. I App. at 275-79. On appeal, 
Lomar apparently has recognized the importance of defining the relevant market, and strongly asserts that the appropriate 
definition is a disputed issue of material fact. Lomar's earlier position arguably could be interpreted as a waiver of a ""market 
analysis"" theory of injury, relieving us of the need to address it here. However, because the District Court chose to examine the 
market analysis prong in its order, Lomar II, 627 F. Supp. at 118-19, we also address it here. "
415,10," Lomar's briefs contains numerous factual allegations regarding such factors and the composition of the relevant market, but 
few of the allegations are supported by specific citation to the extensive record. Apparently, Lomar has left it to the Court to sift 
through the record in search of the particular pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, and affidavits which 
might raise a triable issue of fact on predatory intent. Although we have undertaken this review, we generally have been forced 
to speculate about which documents in the record Lomar believes support both its factual allegations and the inferences 
regarding GF's predatory intent that are to be drawn therefrom."
415,11," The evidence shows that the distributors and wholesalers carefully monitor their competitors' prices. II App. at 5; III App. at 
141; IV App. at 37-38. The firms often provide price catalogues to their customers, and that the catalogues issued by 
competitors are an important source of information in an industry in which prices, market shares, and competitors frequently 
change. I App. at 215; II App. at 113, 242; IV App. at 11. "
423,1," According to the parties, coal slurry is a mixture of ground coal and water. The slurry is pumped through the pipeline and then 
dried to be used as fuel. The proposed pipeline was later expanded to include delivery to utilities in Texas. "
424,2," This doctrine, described in detail below, derives from the decisions in Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor 
Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961), and United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. 
Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965). "
425,3," The remainder of this opinion demonstrates that the parties dispute several points in this petition. A few things, however, are 
not in dispute. For the purposes of its ruling, the district court assumed that the railroads had an otherwise valid claim of privilege 
or immunity and that the documents would not be discoverable absent the crime/fraud exception. Thus we are not presented 
with any question about the initial existence of privilege or immunity. The parties also do not challenge the district court's 
conclusion that a civil violation of the antitrust laws is a ""crime"" or ""fraud"" for purposes of abrogating the attorney/client privilege. 
See Pfizer Inc. v. Lord, 456 F.2d 545 (8th Cir.1972). Finally, there is no dispute over the district court's ruling that ETSI's burden 
in seeking discovery is to make out a prima facie case that the documents were prepared in furtherance of a crime or fraud.  In 
re International Systems & Controls Corporation Securities Litigation, 693 F.2d 1235, 1242 (5th Cir.1982). "
426,4," Work product material, unlike attorney/client communications, is subject to discovery under the provisions of Fed.R.Civ.P. 
26(b)(3). Although ETSI has sought discovery under Rule 26 in the district court, this issue is not before us on this petition for 
mandamus. "
427,5," Our direction here that the court must focus on the specific relationship of the communication to a protected activity is 
consistent with our earlier holding that piercing a claim of privilege through the crime/fraud exception requires a showing that the 
material ""reasonably relate[s] to the fraudulent activity."" International Systems, 693 F.2d at 1243. As the court from which we 
adopted this test stated, ""the exact formulation of a 'test' for relatedness is less important than an understanding of what the test 
must accomplish; easy differentiation between material for which the law should not furnish the protections of a privilege and 
material for which a privilege should be respected."" In re Sealed Case, 219 U.S. App. D.C. 195, 676 F.2d 793, 815 n. 91 
(D.C.Cir.1982). In this case, we have determined that the policies behind Noerr-Pennington require protection for material that is 
directly in furtherance of lawful litigation activity. "
428,6," The commentators take varying positions on the question whether a successful suit can be considered a sham. Areeda and 
Hovenkamp state generally that ""successful judicial action is not a 'sham,'"" but add the caveat that this is ""merely a strong 
presumption, rather than a categorical rule."" P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law 11, 13 (Supp.1986). They also refer 
approvingly to our decision in Coastal States Marketing, Inc. v. Hunt, 694 F.2d 1358 (5th Cir.1983), the decision upon which we 
now rely to hold that some successful petitioning may be found to be sham. Areeda, at 16 (""Perhaps we cannot hope to be more 
precise than to say with the Fifth Circuit's Coastal States decision that a litigant 'should enjoy petitioning immunity from the 
antitrust laws so long as a genuine desire for judicial relief is a significant motivating factor underlying the suit.'""). "
429,," Kinter and Bauer note that success is strong evidence of a legitimate petition, but state that even successful claims may be 
considered to be sham. Kinter & Bauer, Antitrust Exemptions for Private Requests for Governmental Action: A Critical Analysis 
of the Noerr-Pennington Doctrine, 17 U.C.Davis L. Rev. 549, 576 (1984). Handler and DeSevo assert that success on the merits absolutely precludes a finding of sham. Handler & DeSevo, The Noerr 
Doctrine and Its Sham Exception, 6 Cardozo L. Rev. 1, 30-31 (1984). This view is based on their reading of Noerr and 
Pennington to preclude any examination of the petitioner's intent for any purpose. As we discuss below, we read Noerr's 
statement that sham petitioning is that which is not genuinely intended to influence governmental decisionmaking to require an 
examination of the litigant's intent to the extent of asking whether the petition was motivated by a desire for the relief sought. "
430,7," Judge Jolly disagrees at this point and argues that Bill Johnson's Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB, 461 U.S. 731, 103 S. Ct. 2161, 76 
L. Ed. 2d 277 (1983), dictates that Noerr-Pennington protection be extended to any case that has a reasonable legal and factual 
basis. The question in that case was whether the NLRB could enjoin a state court proceeding that had a reasonable basis on the 
ground that it was motivated by a desire to retaliate against striking employees. The Court held that it could not. The Court did 
not, however, state a constitutional rule that all lawsuits with a reasonable basis are immune from the application of otherwise 
valid regulation. Rather, it construed congressional intent behind the NLRA in light of the constitutional right to petition and 
earlier Supreme Court cases that have held that the NLRA does not preempt states from providing a civil remedy for tortious 
conduct occurring during a labor dispute.  Id. at 740-44, 103 S. Ct. at 2168-70. Given the constitutional implications and the lack 
of preemption, the Court concluded that the NLRA does not empower the Board to enjoin lawsuits solely on the basis of 
retaliatory motive. The Court did not define sham for purposes of the antitrust laws, nor did it consider the situation in which the 
litigant, in addition to having a motive generally proscribed by the regulation at issue, also has no significant desire to obtain the 
relief prayed for. We therefore find no inconsistency between Bill Johnson's and our reading of the Fifth Circuit controlling 
precedent in the antitrust area."
430,8," Professors Areeda and Hovenkamp also state that they would not withhold protection from a person who ""had a reasonable 
claim in the other forum but did not subjectively know it."" Areeda, at 10. They point to ""doubt about the wisdom of punishing such 
a person"" and ""the difficulty of properly proving subjective intent in the first place."" Id. This statement seems to adopt a purely 
objective approach to determining sham. We disagree. As our discussion of successful petitioning demonstrates, the Supreme 
Court's decisions, as interpreted by this court and others, necessarily entail an examination of the petitioner's subjective 
motivations. Moreover, aside from the binding force of this precedent, we are not persuaded by the reasoning against subjecting 
some persons with objectively reasonable claims to antitrust scrutiny. Rather than punishing a person for simply not knowing the 
reasonableness of his claim, our ruling withholds Noerr-Pennington protection from persons who do not care about the 
reasonableness of their claim and who bring claims for the improper purpose of harming a competitor through the mere 
invocation of governmental decisionmaking processes. We do not believe the difficulty of inquiring into intent justifies a different 
rule; if a plaintiff can adduce sufficient evidence to overcome the strong inference that persons with meritorious claims wish to 
obtain relief upon them we believe he should prevail. We cannot endorse a rule that would require a court to blindly extend 
protection in the face of evidence that the party was in fact not exercising the protected right to petition. We also note that "
431,," Areeda and Hovenkamp themselves would not preclude applying the antitrust laws to all petitions that had a reasonable basis. 
As noted earlier, supra note 9, they leave open the possibility of holding some successful petitions to be sham."
431,9," ETSI devotes considerable argument in its brief to their claim that the railroads had no ""legitimate interest in the outcome"" of 
the Andrews litigation. To the extent this argument goes to the point we have just made in the text that parties without a 
reasonable basis for asserting standing are not protected by Noerr-Pennington, we agree. We disagree, however, if ETSI's claim 
goes beyond that to suggest that the railroads are not protected because they may have had no interest in the substantive law 
upon which the Andrews' court granted its relief. If the railroads' interest is such that they had a reasonable claim of standing, 
then their interest was sufficient to allow them the protected right to seek to influence the court's decision and obtain relief. That 
their motivation may have been to harm ETSI rather than to promote proper exercise of authority between the Department of 
Interior and the Army Corps of Engineers is irrelevant. See Noerr, 365 U.S. at 139-40, 81 S. Ct. at 531 (""Insofar as the railroads' 
campaign was directed toward obtaining governmental action, its legality was not at all affected by any anticompetitive purpose it 
may have had."")."
431,10," The Andrews district court did sustain the railroads' claim of standing as to some claims (none of which formed the basis for 
the ruling in that case), but we do not believe this to be dispositive. If the railroads did not actually and reasonably expect to 
prevail on the claims for which they had standing, or if that expectation was not a significant motivating factor underlying their 
decision to bring the suit, the existence of those claims should not protect them. "
432,11," Our discussion here assumes, without deciding, that Union Pacific had no reasonable claim of standing to participate in 
Andrews. Should the district court determine that Union Pacific had such a claim, the mere fact that Union Pacific did not actually 
formally join the litigation does not deprive it of protection. "
433,12," Our conclusion here results in the possible piercing of Union Pacific's claim of privilege for documents prepared in connection 
with the Andrews litigation. We do not address the extent to which these documents, or documents prepared in connection with 
KCS's participation in the litigation, might still be immune from discovery because of a privilege held by the state of Nebraska or 
other parties involved in that litigation. Indeed, after the district court's ruling granting ETSI's motion to compel discovery, 
Nebraska and others involved in the Andrews litigation sought a protective order from the district court against disclosure of 
documents as to which they hold a privilege. The district court did not rule on that motion because of the pendency of the 
present petition. These parties have filed amicus briefs in this court urging that we recognize their claims of privilege, especially 
in light of the pendency of the Andrews case before the Supreme Court. We are confident the district court in any further rulings 
on ETSI's discovery motions will act to safeguard any viable privilege these parties hold."
433,13," The railroads also claim that the district court cannot conclude the window lawsuits defense was a sham because the special 
master made factual findings to the contrary that were not clearly erroneous. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 53(e). We do not agree that the 
district court was obligated to give any deference to the special master's findings in the case. At the time he submitted his report, 
the special master indicated his desire to receive comments and objections from the parties before preparing his final opinion. 
The parties submitted their objections but the master resigned his position before he could act on them. It appears, therefore, 
that the special master's report was only a preliminary one. "

439,1," Marrese was reaffirmed by this Court in Doe on behalf of Doe v. St. Joseph's Hospital, 788 F.2d 411 (7th Cir. 1986), and 
Ezpeleta v. Sisters of Mercy Health Corp., 800 F.2d 119 (7th Cir. 1986) (per curiam), both of which dealt with hospital peer 
review in Indiana, and was recently followed by the Ninth Circuit in Patrick v. Burget, 800 F.2d 1498 (1986). "
440,2," The recently enacted Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-660, 100 Stat. 3743, 3784 (to be codified at 42 
U.S.C. § 11101 et seq.), exempts professional review actions commenced on or after November 14, 1986, from civil damages 
for inter alia federal antitrust law violations when those proceedings employ certain minimum procedural safeguards and report 
a summary of their actions to the state Board of Medical Examiners, which in turn must report this information to the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services. Id. at §§ 412, 423, 424, 100 Stat. at 3785-3787, 3789-3791. By its terms, this statute does not 
apply to the present action. Significantly, the mandatory reporting requirements needed to qualify for the exemption from civil 
damages far exceed any alleged reporting under the Illinois laws and regulations during the period in question in this lawsuit."
440,3," The Illinois Hospital Association and the Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council filed an amicus brief urging that peer review 
in Illinois falls within the state action exemption to the antitrust laws. Their brief fails to show that from 1974 to 1978 Illinois 
actively supervised hospital peer review committees, an essential showing for that exemption to apply. "

459,2, The Attorney General argued that the conspiracy lasted for at least 4208 days after the effective date of the Act.
459,3," Straco and Agabiti entered into consent decrees with the Attorney General.  Hence, they are not parties to this appeal. "
463,4," Some types of conduct, such as price fixing, are per se violations of the Antitrust Act because of their inherent tendency to 
eliminate competition.  Pomanowski v. Monmouth County Bd. of Realtors, 89 N.J. 306, 311 (1982). Other restraints of trade are 
evaluated under a ""rule of reason"" test. Under that test defendants' conduct ""is evaluated to determine whether it in fact causes 
significant harm relative to the business justification."" Id. Thus, it is possible that a defendant acted in good faith when it adopted 
a mode of conduct ultimately ruled unlawful under a ""rule of reason test."" "
464,5," We note, however, that this seems to be an appropriate case for the imposition of a per diem penalty.  Federal courts have 
consistently found such penalties appropriate where (1) the detrimental effect to the public and the advantage to the violator 
continue over time, and (2) the violator could eliminate the effects of the violation if it were motivated to do so.  See, e.g., United 
States v. Phelps Dodge Indus., Inc., supra, 589 F.Supp. at 1360-61; Federal Trade Comm'n v. Consolidated Foods Corp., supra, 
396 F.Supp. at 1356. The antitrust violations in this case appear to possess the above characteristics.  First, except perhaps 
during the hiatus, the bid-rigging and the market allocation occurred continuously over approximately a 12-year period, and 
defendants' control over the market probably became stronger with time during this period.  Second, defendants could certainly 
have eliminated the effects of their violations by simply discontinuing their bid-rigging and market allocation. "
475,*," The Honorable Charles M. Allen, United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, sitting by designation. "
500,1," We also note in passing that Plaintiff presented evidence at trial that Florida's regulatory scheme was incomplete even as to the 
regulation of rates. Specifically, Plaintiff argued that such regulation is an imperfect constraint on a utility's ability to exploit a 
monopolistic position, that competition between regulated utilities yields lower prices, and that when rate regulation is the sole 
limiting factor on the exercise of monopoly power, utilities can earn above normal rates of return. [Tr. 6-253-257]. It is not 
essential to our holding that we address the crux of Plaintiff's argument, which amounts to a direct challenge to the regulatory 
process. We do note, however, that this argument was raised and was not controverted by Defendant. "
518,2," In California Retail Liquor Dealers Association v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., a wine distributor challenged California's resale price 
maintenance and price posting statutes for the wholesale wine trade as violative of the Sherman Act. 445 U.S. 97, 99, 100 S. Ct. 
937, 63 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1980). The Court stated that its decisions had established two standards for antitrust immunity under 
Parker v. Brown. ""First, the challenged restraint must be 'one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy'; 
second, the policy must be 'actively supervised' by the State itself."" Id.  at 105 (citation omitted). The Court found that the 
legislative policy in Midcal Aluminum forthrightly stated its purpose to permit resale price maintenance; accordingly, the first 
standard had been met. The program, however, did not meet the second requirement for Parker immunity because ""the State 
simply authorizes price-setting and enforces the prices established by private parties. The State neither establishes prices nor 
reviews the reasonableness of the price schedules; nor does it regulate the terms of fair trade contracts. The State does not 
monitor market conditions or engage in any 'pointed reexamination' of the program."" Id. at 105-06 (footnote omitted). Without 
such supervision, the Court found that the plan was subject to the antitrust laws."
518,3," In Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v. United States, the most recent Supreme Court case to address this issue, 
private carriers formed a rate bureau that submitted joint proposals on rates to state regulatory agencies.  471 U.S. 48, 105 S. 
Ct. 1721, 85 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1985). State laws permitted joint proposals but did not require them.  471 U.S. at 50. The Supreme 
Court held that the activity was immune from antitrust attack.  Id. at 66. The Court reasoned that Parker did not require 
compulsion because Parker was an attempt to reconcile state displacement of competition with federal antitrust goals, and 
requiring compulsion would force a higher degree of state anticompetitive conduct.  Id. at 61. "
519,," Southern Motor Carriers, however, presented the Court with one unusual twist. For although the North Carolina, Georgia and 
Tennessee statutes expressly permitted collective ratemaking, Mississippi's statutes did not specifically address collective 
ratemaking.  Id. at 63. The Court noted that Mississippi did give its public service commission the authority to regulate common 
carriers and the power to prescribe just and reasonable rates. From this the Court reasoned as follows: The legislature thus made clear its intent that intrastate rates would be determined by a regulatory agency, rather than by 
the market. The details of the inherently anticompetitive rate-setting process, however, are left to the agency's discretion. 
The State Commission has exercised its discretion by actively encouraging collective ratemaking among common carriers. 
We do not believe that the actions petitioners took pursuant to this regulatory program should be deprived of Parker 
immunity. Id. at 63-64 (citation omitted). Accordingly, since the proposals were submitted pursuant to statutes which permitted collective 
ratemaking or pursuant to a statute which clearly articulated the state's intent to displace price competition among carriers with a 
regulatory structure, the first prong of the Midcal Aluminum test was met. The second prong of the Midcal Aluminum test was 
conceded.  Id. at 66."
519,4," In Hoover v. Ronwin, an unsuccessful candidate for the bar alleged that the Committee on Examinations and Admissions had 
set grading criteria to limit the entrance of new attorneys rather than to measure their competence.  466 U.S. 558, 204 S. Ct. 
1989, 80 L. Ed. 2d 590 (1984). The Supreme Court held that the action of the Committee was immune because the action of the 
Committee was that of the state itself.  Id. at 570. The Court reasoned that ""although the Arizona Supreme Court necessarily 
delegated the administration of the admissions process to the Committee, the court itself approved the particular grading formula 
and retained the sole authority to determine who should be admitted to the practice of law in Arizona."" Id. at 573. As a result, the 
Court found it unnecessary to address whether the policy was clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state action.  Id.  at 
569. The Court further stated that if the same activity had been carried out by private parties pursuant to state authorization, then 
the two-part Midcal Aluminum test would have been applied to ensure that the conduct was contemplated by the state.  Id. at 
568-69."
519,5," In Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, as a part of its regulation of the bar, the Arizona Supreme Court had promulgated a rule 
against advertising by lawyers.  433 U.S. 350, 97 S. Ct. 2691, 53 L. Ed. 2d 810 (1977). The Supreme Court upheld the rule 
because it was the ""affirmative command"" of the Arizona Supreme Court which had adopted, supervised and enforced the rule, 
thereby acting as sovereign. The Court deemed it significant that the ""state policy [was] so clearly and affirmatively expressed 
and that the State's supervision [was] so active."" Id. at 362."
519,6," In Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, a case that involved the publication of a minimum fee schedule for lawyers of that state's bar, 
the Court found that mere enforcement by the state bar of a county bar association's minimum fee schedule was not the act of 
the state as sovereign even though the bar was a state agency for some purposes.  421 U.S. 773, 790-91, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. 
Ed. 2d 572 (1975). The Court stated that the anticompetitive activities were not ""compelled by direction of the State acting as a 
sovereign."" Id. at 791 (emphasis added). The Court looked to state statutes and state supreme court ethical opinions and found 
no evidence of compulsion.  Id. at 790-91. This compulsion requirement was only renounced recently by the Supreme Court in 
Southern Motor Carriers. Even without the compulsion requirement, however, it has been suggested that the result in Goldfarb 
would not differ.  Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc., 471 U.S. at 61. For although the State Bar was empowered to 
oversee the practice of law, it is unlikely that the state intended price fixing to be one of its specific powers. See Lopatka, State 
Action and Municipal Antitrust Immunity: An Economic Approach, 53 Fordham L.Rev. 23, 39-40 (1984). Thus, Goldfarb still 
would not meet the first prong of the Midcal Aluminum test for state action immunity. "
520,7," In New Motor Vehicle Board v. Orrin W. Fox Co., the Court reviewed a state law (the Automobile Franchise Act) which gave an 
existing auto dealership the right to petition a state agency if a manufacturer attempted to create a new dealership in the same 
area.  439 U.S. 96, 99 S. Ct. 403, 58 L. Ed. 2d 361 (1978). The state agency could refuse to allow the new franchise. The Court 
held that the decisions of the agency were outside the reach of the antitrust laws because the Act's regulatory scheme was ""a 
system of regulation, clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed, designed to displace unfettered business freedom in the 
matter of the establishment and relocation of automobile dealerships."" Id. at 109."
520,8," The Court addressed anticompetitive activity carried out by private parties in Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., where the Supreme 
Court held that a public utility's program of distributing free light bulbs to customers was not immune from antitrust attack despite 
the fact that the program was set forth in a tariff approved by the state.  428 U.S. 579, 96 S. Ct. 3110, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141 (1976). 
The Court stated that the state's participation in adopting and implementing the anticompetitive conduct must be dominant in 
order to immunize such conduct from the Sherman act. In this case there was no statute authorizing the regulation of light bulbs; 
indeed, there was no evidence of any state policy relating to light bulbs.  Id. at 584-85. Therefore, the Court found that this 
conduct was not immunized from the Sherman Act. "
522,9," The relevant portion of Fla. Stat. § 364.335 (1985) provides as follows: Application for certificate. (1) Each application for a certificate shall: (a) Provide all information required by rule or order of the commission, which may include a detailed inquiry into the ability 
of the applicant to provide service, a detailed inquiry into the territory and facilities involved, and a detailed inquiry into the 
existence of service from other sources within geographical proximity to the territory applied for. . . . . (4) The commission may grant a certificate, in whole or in part or with modifications in the public interest, but in no event 
granting authority greater than that requested in the application or amendments thereto and noticed under subsection (1); 
or it may deny a certificate. The commission shall not grant a certificate for a proposed telephone company, or for the 
extension of an existing telephone company, which will be in competition with or duplicate the local exchange services 
provided by any other telephone company unless it first determines that the existing facilities are inadequate to meet the 
reasonable needs of the public and it first amends the certificate of such other telephone company to remove the basis for 
competition or duplication of services. The commission may, however, grant such a certificate for a proposed telephone 
company, which will be providing competitive or duplicative pay telephone service only without determining that existing 
facilities are inadequate to meet the reasonable needs of the public and without amending the certificate of another 
telephone company to remove the basis for competition or duplication of services. Pay telephone service shall include that 
telephone service using telephones that are capable of accepting payment by specie, paper money, or credit cards. Fla. Stat. § 364.337 (1985) provides as follows: Duplicative or competitive services. (1) When the commission grants a certificate to a telephone company for any type of service that is in competition with or 
that duplicates the services provided by another telephone company, the commission, if it finds that such action is 
consistent with the public interest, may: (a) Prescribe different requirements for the company than are otherwise prescribed for telephone companies; or (b) Exempt the company from some or all of the requirements of this chapter. (2) In determining whether the actions authorized by subsection (1) are consistent with the public interest, the commission 
shall consider: (a) The number of firms providing the service; (b) The geographic availability of the service from other firms; (c) The quality of service available from alternative suppliers; (d) The effect on telephone service rates charged to customers of other companies; and (e) Any other factors that the commission considers relevant to the public interest. "
523,," (3) Each amount paid by an interexchange telephone company to a telephone company providing local service for use of 
the local network shall be deducted from gross operating revenues for purposes of determining the amount of the 
regulatory fee assessed the interexchange telephone company pursuant to s. 350.113."
523,10," The relevant portion of Fla. Stat. § 367.041 (1985) provides as follows: Application. Each applicant for a certificate shall: (1) Provide information required by rule or order of the commission, which may include a detailed inquiry into the ability of 
the applicant to provide service, the territory and facilities involved, the need for service in the territory involved, and the 
existence or non-existence of service from other sources within geographical proximity to the territory applied for; . . . . The relevant portion of Fla. Stat. § 367.051 (1985) provides as follows: Issuance of certificate. . . . . (2) If, within 20 days following the official date of filing, the commission receives from the public counsel or a governmental 
agency, or from a utility or consumer who would be substantially affected by the requested certification, a written objection 
requesting a proceeding pursuant to s. 120.57, the commission shall order such proceeding conducted in or near the 
territory applied for, if feasible. Notwithstanding the ability to object on any other ground, a county or municipal government 
has standing to object on the ground that the issuance of the certificate will violate established local comprehensive plans 
developed pursuant to ss. 163.3161-163.3211. If any consumer, utility, or governmental agency or the public counsel 
requests a public hearing on the application, such hearing shall, if feasible, be held in or near the territory applied for; and 
the transcript of such hearing and any material submitted at or before the hearing shall be considered as part of the record 
of the application and any proceeding related thereto. (3)(a) The commission may grant a certificate, in whole or in part or with modifications in the public interest, but may in no 
event grant authority greater than that requested in the application or amendments thereto and noticed under s. 367.041, or 
it may deny a certificate. The commission shall not grant a certificate for a proposed system, or for the extension of an 
existing system, which will be in competition with, or a duplication of, any other system or portion of a system, unless it first 
determines that such other system or portion thereof is inadequate to meet the reasonable needs of the public or that the 
person operating the system is unable, refuses, or neglects to provide reasonably adequate service. The relevant portion of Fla. Stat. § 367.055 (1985) provides as follows: Application for deletion of territory. (1) Each applicant for deletion of territory shall: (a) Provide the information required by rule or order of the commission, which may include a detailed inquiry into the ability 
or lack of ability of the applicant to provide service, the need or lack of need for service in the territory sought to be deleted, 
and the existence or non-existence of service from other sources within geographical proximity to the territory sought to be 
deleted."
523,11," The relevant portion of Fla. Stat. § 366.04 (1985) provides as follows: Jurisdiction. . . . . (d) To approve territorial agreements between and among rural electric cooperatives, municipal electric utilities, and other 
electric utilities under its jurisdiction. However, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to alter existing territorial 
agreements as between the parties to such agreements. (e) To resolve any territorial dispute involving service areas between and among rural electric cooperatives, municipal 
electric utilities, and other electric utilities under its jurisdiction. In resolving territorial disputes, the commission may 
consider, but not be limited to consideration of, the ability of the utilities to expand services within their own capabilities and "
524,," the nature of the area involved, including population, the degree of urbanization of the area, its proximity to other urban 
areas, and the present and reasonably foreseeable future requirements of the area for other utility services. "
531,12," In Town of Hallie v. City of Eau Claire, plaintiffs claimed that the city was trying to extend its existing sewage treatment 
monopoly to a monopoly on sewage transportation services.  471 U.S. 34, 105 S. Ct. 1713, 85 L. Ed. 2d 24 (1985). The city 
relied on a state statute which provided that a municipality may by ordinance fix the limits of its service to unincorporated areas, 
and shall have no obligation to serve beyond the area so delineated. The Seventh Circuit upheld the city's practices because 
they were effectuated pursuant to a clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy to displace competition, the first 
prong of the Midcal Aluminum test. 700 F.2d 376, 384-85 (7th Cir. 1983). The Supreme Court affirmed, but noted that the 
activities were authorized, but not compelled, by the state, which did not actively supervise them.  471 U.S. at 45-47. The Court 
held that the first prong of Midcal Aluminum had been met because the statute showed that ""the legislature contemplated the 
kind of action complained of."" Id. at 44 (quoting City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 98 S. Ct. 1123, 
55 L. Ed. 2d 364 (1978). The Court thus indicated that the test was one of forseeability by the legislature of the anticompetitive 
acts that would follow. Id. at 42-44.  Additionally, for the first time the Court held that a municipality, unlike a private party, need 
not satisfy the second Midcal Aluminum prong, because absent a contrary showing, a municipality presumptively acts in the 
public interest. Id. at 46. "
548,1," HN4[
] The elements of a tying claim under Section 1 of the Sherman Act are the same as those of a tying claim under Section 3 of the Clayton Act, with the exception that under the latter the tying and tied items must both constitute ""goods, wares, 
merchandise, machinery, supplies or other commodities."" See 3 Von Kalinowski, Antitrust and Trade Regulation § 12.04[1] 
(1986)."
548,2," Mobil also argues with respect to the gasoline claim that plaintiffs have no ""legal injury"" as required by Section 4 of the Clayton 
Act, and that the plaintiffs' claims are barred under the state action doctrine.  Given the disposition of Mobil's ""single product"" 
argument below, the court does not address these alternative arguments. "
550,3," Plaintiffs have stipulated that they do not allege that Mobil used economic power that it has in the service station site market to 
force purchases of any tied items. The service station leases are not, therefore, tying items in this case."
550,4," The ""Retail Dealer Contracts"" mention Mobil's ""retail credit program,"" to which plaintiffs presumably refer as the ""Mobil credit 
card system,"" in defining the ""Mobil franchise package."" However, the contracts refer to the credit program only as an option in 
which dealers could have participated: ""If the Buyer participates in the Seller's retail credit program . . . ."" Whether a given dealer 
participated in the credit program (or, indeed, was required to do so) does not appear from the agreements before the court. "
551,5," The best plaintiffs have been able to achieve in this vein is to discover certain memoranda, written by low-level personnel in 
Mobil's legal department, suggesting such a separate licensing arrangement in Connecticut. There is no evidence in the record, 
however, that Mobil ever instituted such a practice."
551,6," The court has been liberal in allowing plaintiffs a broad spectrum of discovery on this issue. After years of pursuing their inquiry, 
however, plaintiffs cannot point to a single instance where the Mobil trademark was licensed or sold apart from its connection to 
a Mobil-branded product.  Plaintiffs have found many instances where the converse is true, that is, where Mobil sold gasoline 
that was not marketed under the trademark ""Mobil."" These sales of plain gasoline have no effect on the issue of the separability 
of the Mobil trademark from Mobil-branded gasoline, however, but simply establish the hardly astonishing fact that there is a 
demand for unbranded gasoline. This state of affairs does not establish that there was a separate market for the Mobil 
trademark, apart from the gasoline to which the mark was attached. It is the plaintiffs' burden to show that the ""character of the 
demand"" for the Mobil trademark is such that Mobil's alleged tie linked ""two distinctive markets."" See Jefferson Parish Hospital 
Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 19, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 (1984). Plaintiffs' failure to show that the Mobil trademark 
was ever licensed apart from a Mobil-branded product leaves the Hyde burden unsatisfied. See Jack Walters & Sons Corp. v. 
Morton Bldg., Inc., 737 F.2d 698 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1018, 83 L. Ed. 2d 359, 105 S. Ct. 432 (1984). "
552,7," Plaintiffs also apparently rely on the restrictions in the ""Equipment Loan Agreements"" with ""Sign and Rent Riders,"" which 
required dealers to use equipment and signs rented from Mobil solely for Mobil's products, as constituting tying provisions. The 
court disagrees. Those provisions did not require dealers to purchase any products from Mobil, or restrict dealers from 
purchasing and reselling non-Mobil supplied products, so long as non-Mobil supplied equipment and signs were used to sell 
such products. "
553,8," Three different types of franchising are noted in a law review article cited by the Krehl court, McCarthy, Trademark Franchising 
and Antitrust: The Trouble with Tie-ins, 58 Cal.L.Rev. 1085, 1089 (1970). Of course, other methods and nomenclatures for 
classifying franchise arrangements exist. See, e.g., Strasser, Big Macs and Radio Shacks: Antitrust Policy for Business Format 
Franchises, 27 Ariz.L.Rev. 341-2 (1985); Note, Trademark Franchising and Antitrust Law - The Two-Product Rule for Tying 
Arrangements, 27 Syracuse L.Rev. 953, 955-57 (1976). It is universally acknowledged that the term ""franchising"" covers a wide 
range of business relationships, and it seems equally clear that no hard and fast line always may be drawn between one 
recognized ""type"" of franchising arrangement and another. See Casey v. Diet Center, Inc., 590 F. Supp. 1561, 1566 (N.D. Cal. 
1984). Some skepticism, therefore, may justly be directed at a judicial test that involves a determination whether a given 
franchising system is of one type or another. On reflection, however, it appears that the line can be accurately and justly drawn by the court in most of the cases likely to 
arise. No one would argue, for example, that McDonald's is in the hamburger manufacturing or distributing business, or that 
Dolby Laboratories is actually engaging in ""business format"" franchising when it sells sound equipment to theatres.  In systems 
that arguably are hybrids, guidance may be obtained by narrowing the inquiry. ""The crucial inquiry is into the relationship 
between the trademark and the product allegedly tied to its sale."" Krehl, 664 F.2d at 1353 n.11. "
555,9," The court is unable to find any Eighth Circuit case that mentions the above distinction between distribution franchises and 
business format franchises in the trademark franchising context. Existing precedent in this circuit, however, does not appear to 
be inconsistent with the distinction.  Of the cases brought to the court's attention, Rosebrough Monument Co. v. Memorial Park 
Cemetery, 666 F.2d 1130 (8th Cir. 1981), and Terre Du Lac Ass'n, Inc. v. Terre Du Lac, Inc., 772 F.2d 467 (8th Cir. 1985), cert.  
denied, 475 U.S. 1082, 89 L. Ed. 2d 718, 106 S. Ct. 1460 (1986), do not involve tying claims in the trademark franchising 
context.  Northern v. McGraw-Edison Co., 542 F.2d 1336 (8th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1097, 97 S. Ct. 1115, 51 L. Ed. 
2d 544 (1977) involves a trademark franchise tying claim. My review of Northern leads me to agree with Mobil's view that the 
franchise there was of a business format nature, and that Northern is, therefore, not inconsistent with the disposition of the 
instant motion. The rationale in Kugler v. AAMCO Automatic Transmissions, Inc., 460 F.2d 1214 (8th Cir. 1972) appears to 
support the present ruling."
555,10," The Krehl court did speak of consumer perceptions in explaining why a trademark may be a separate item for tying purposes 
in a ""business format"" franchise, but not in a ""distribution"" type franchise. See Krehl, 664 F.2d at 1353. The Hamro court spoke 
similarly in reaching its decision. See Hamro, 674 F.2d at 788. Consumer perceptions play no part, however, in distinguishing "
556,," one type franchise from the other; rather, the three-part test applied above is used, which distinguishes what are essentially 
product distribution systems from systems where merely a method of doing business is sold. "
557,11," The court in Power Test Petroleum Distributors v. Calcu Gas, 754 F.2d 91 (2d Cir. 1985) does seem to rely heavily on 
concepts from trademark law in its approach to the single product issue. Ultimately, however, Power Test follows the lead of 
Krehl and Redd. In any case, to the extent that Power Test relies on an outmoded ""source"" theory of trademark law this court 
does not follow its rationale. "
559,12," In fact, there is evidence in the record that some Mobil dealers (though apparently none of the plaintiffs in this action), did sell 
non-Mobil supplied gasohol from plain pumps. "
560,13," The plaintiffs' stipulation that they will not offer evidence of coercion individually would summarily cause them to suffer a failure 
of proof under the law of at least one circuit. See Amey v. Gulf Abstract & Title, Inc., 758 F.2d 1486 (11th Cir. 1985), cert. 
denied, 475 U.S. 1107, 89 L. Ed. 2d 912, 106 S. Ct. 1513 (1986) (requiring ""evidence of actual coercion by the seller that in fact 
forced the buyer to [purchase] the tied item,"" as part of a plaintiff's prima facie showing). In other courts, an explicit contractual 
tying term may suffice, without any showing of coercion on an individual basis. See Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp., 561 F.2d 434, 
452 (3rd Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1086, 55 L. Ed. 2d 791, 98 S. Ct. 1280 (1978); see generally Von Kalinowski 2 
Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulation § 6G.02[1]. In any case, as explained in the text above, given plaintiffs' stipulation 
regarding individual proof, the plaintiffs' TBAS claim would be defective under either rule."
560,14," Plaintiffs' reliance on Blanton v. Mobil Oil Corp., 721 F.2d 1207 (W.D. Wash. 1983) is misplaced. The court in Blanton did not 
rely solely on the terms of Mobil dealer agreements to establish coercion, but on substantial evidence offered on an individual 
basis of coercion exerted by Mobil marketing representatives on Mobil dealers regarding purchases of TBAS.  Id. at 1210-11. "
561,15," During the course of this litigation, the plaintiffs stipulated that some class members desired to purchase Mobil-branded oil 
from Mobil in quantities equal to or exceeding their minimum purchase requirements. The court subsequently allowed the 
plaintiffs to withdraw that stipulation. As the court does not accept Mobil's argument relating to the plaintiffs' desire to purchase 
their minimum quantities of oil, any disputes of fact on the issue of individual class member wishes in that regard do not preclude 
summary judgment. "
567,1," Ray Bohn is the current Commissioner of Labor and Industry.  Because an earlier appellate opinion in this case is titled in the 
name of Commissioner Keefe (see footnote 3), we have not substituted the name of the current Commissioner even though the 
appellate court rules allow for substitution. See Minn. R. Civ. App. P. Rule 143.04."
567,2," For purposes of clarity, we consider count seven to include all allegations of improper rulemaking procedures."
567,3," In an earlier appeal, respondent sought protective relief from appellant's discovery request. We held that respondent could not 
be deposed by oral deposition, but if appellant could ""demonstrate ineffectiveness of questioning by interrogatory, deposition 
upon written questions"" could be conducted.  Ellingson & Associates, Inc. v. Keefe, 396 N.W.2d 694, 697 (Minn. Ct. App. 1986), 
pet. for rev. denied, (Minn. Jan. 21, 1987). "
573,*, Judge Bork was a member of the Court at the time this case was argued but did not participate in the final decision. 
576,1," The ""migration strategy,"" according to petitioners, comprised AT&T's attempt to ""force early replacement of the entire installed 
base of terminal equipment in the United States, before AT&T's competitors were large enough to supply the demand . . . [and] 
put in place long-term leases with termination charges, tying the embedded [CPE] base customers to AT&T until the mid-
1980's."" Brief of Petitioners at 9-10."
576,2," Petitioners' strained contention that the Commission was obliged to undertake a broad and factual investigation of this 
migration strategy is mistaken. All the Commission had to do, it did: It fairly considered the question of whether the termination 
charges were contrary to the public interest. Nothing required the Commission, in the termination charge proceeding, to embark 
on a fishing expedition for any anticompetitive practices in some way arguably related to CPE. Petitioners are free, through a suit 
in district court under the antitrust laws, to pursue any of their claims of anticompetitive activity. "
577,3," Petitioners expend great energy in challenging the Commission's suggestion that ""the arguments made by AT&T-IS's 
competitors that the CPE leases derive from a period when AT&T-IS exercised dominant control over the CPE marketplace 
appear to be substantially overstated."" 100 F.C.C.2d at 1316 n.74. Petitioners find this argument central because they seek to 
focus our attention on the competitiveness of the CPE market in the past. The Commission placed the argument in a footnote 
because it correctly realized that the issue before it -- and before this court -- is whether the selective waiver of termination 
charges has an anticompetitive effect on today's CPE market. The market of the past is irrelevant -- this is not a damage action 
for past violations of the antitrust laws."
577,4," Petitioners have at no time suggested that the lease rates minus the termination charges are below the equipment's cost. 
Petitioners did suggest to the Commission that the termination charges provided AT&T-IS with more revenue than that required 
to recover the cost of leased CPE, to the detriment of CPE lease customers. In an extended discussion, the Commission 
rejected this argument.  100 F.C.C.2d at 1317-26. Petitioners do not make any such argument on appeal. "
578,5," The Commission's discussion stated: Furthermore, we fail to discern any overrecovery deriving from AT&T's use of accelerated tax depreciation and investment 
tax credits. With respect to the former, in the CPE Detariffing Order, we found that AT&T-IS will be liable for deferred taxes 
on transferred equipment as a result of the BOCs having depreciated the CPE at a faster rate for tax purposes than for 
book purposes and having normalized the difference. These taxes will be payable by AT&T-IS in the latter part of the life of 
the CPE when depreciation charges for book purposes exceed those available for tax purposes or when CPE book basis 
exceeds its tax basis when it is sold. Accordingly, we ordered the deferred tax reserves transferred to AT&T-IS together 
with the associated CPE. As we explained in the CPE Detariffing Order, ""the deferred tax reserves . . . will not provide any 
cash to make these payments to the Treasury, but they will provide AT&T-IS with an accounting entry against which to 
charge those payments rather than charge them against income."" 99 Thus, we fail to see how the deferred tax reserves, 
which represent the tax liability AT&T-IS inherited from the BOCs as a result of the CPE transfer, reflect any overrecovery 
of investment on AT&T-IS's part.  [**22] n. 99. . . . We recently upheld the transfer of the deferred tax reserves to AT&T-IS in the CPE Reconsideration Order at 
paras. 78-84. "
578,100, F.C.C.2d at 1323 & n.99 (some footnotes omitted). 
583,1," The attempts to name the appropriate defendants in this case are marked by confusion. The original complaint named 
""American Telephone and Telegraph Information Systems, a/k/a AT&T a foreign/New York corporation."" Defendants' counsel 
appeared on behalf of ""AT&T Information Systems, Inc."" Plaintiff moved to amend her complaint more than a year after it was 
filed to name a different party, American Telephone & Telegraph Information Systems, Inc., a/k/a AT&T Information Systems, a 
Delaware corporation. Counsel has since filed an appearance on behalf of ""American Telephone & Telegraph Company,"" and 
moved for dismissal on behalf of that defendant. This opinion applies to both ""AT&T Information Systems, Inc.,"" and ""American 
Telephone and Telegraph Company,"" names that differ slightly from those used by the plaintiff in her latest complaint."
583,2," Count XI is a general request for injunctive relief restraining defendants from interrupting plaintiffs service and changing her 
rates. As we have determined that plaintiff has stated no cause of action under federal law and that we have no jurisdiction over 
her state law claims, we must dismiss this count as well."
583,3," Bell's Motion for Summary Judgment includes supporting factual material in the form of affidavits of Bell personnel. These 
statements related primarily to the state claims set forth by plaintiff an Bell's role in the contractual relationship. Because we 
have no jurisdiction over these state claims and the federal claims fail to state a cause of action, we do not rely on this material 
in our decision. "
584,4," We recognize that plaintiff is proceeding pro se and we read her complaint liberally in order to determine whether she has 
stated a claim.  Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520-21 (1971); Fitzmaurice v. Local 712, Int'l Brotherhood of Teamsters, No. 84 
C 9197, Memorandum Op. at 4. To this end, we assess the new allegations made in her responsive memoranda throughout this 
opinion even though they are not technically before us on this motion to dismiss. Rodgers v. Lincoln Towing Service, Inc., 771 
F.2d 194, 198 (7th Cir. 1985)."
584,5," Plaintiff's responses to the motions of Bell and AT&T-IS, although paginated differently, feature essentially identical texts. We 
will refer to both as ""Plaintiff's Response"" and will identify the particular defendant addressed in parentheses. "
588,6," We emphasize for plaintiffs information that we have given no consideration to the merits of her state law claims, and add that 
dismissal for lack of jurisdiction by a federal court gives an Illinois plaintiff one year after the date of this opinion to refile the claim 
in state court even though the statute of limitations may have run out during the pendency of the action in the federal court. 111. 
Rev. Stat. ch. 110, § 13-2 17; see Anderson v. Illinois Tool Works, No. 82 C 7207, Memorandum Op. at 15 (N.D. 111. Jan. 8, 
1987) (Grady, J.). "
595,1," Summary judgment for two other individual defendants, Robert Guidry and Carl Nutter, is the subject of a separate appeal."
595,2," Except where specific identification is pertinent, we have referred to both plaintiffs generally as ""Union City."""
595,3, Carbide has since fired Nutter and brought a separate suit against him. 
596,4, See infra note 6.
596,5," As we noted earlier, although Channel won its case, it later settled with Union City. Accordingly, it is no longer in the appeal. "
597,6," 26(f) Discovery Conference. At any time after commencement of an action the court may direct the attorneys for the parties to 
appear before it for a conference on the subject of discovery. The court shall do so upon motion by the attorney for any party if 
the motion includes: (1) A statement of the issues as they then appear; (2) A proposed plan and schedule of discovery; (3) Any limitations proposed to be placed on discovery; (4) Any other proposed orders with respect to discovery; and (5) A statement showing that the attorney making the motion has made a reasonable effort to reach agreement with 
opposing attorneys on the matters set forth in the motion. Each party and his attorney are under a duty to participate in 
good faith in the framing of a discovery plan if a plan is proposed by the attorney for any party. Notice of the motion shall be 
served on all parties. Objections or additions to matters set forth in the motion shall be served not later than 10 days after 
service of the motion. Following the discovery conference, the court shall enter an order tentatively identifying the issues for discovery purposes, 
establishing a plan and schedule for discovery, setting limitations on discovery, if any; and determining such other matters, 
including the allocation of expenses, as are necessary for the proper management of discovery in the action. An order may be 
altered or amended whenever justice so requires. Subject to the right of a party who properly moves for a discovery conference to prompt convening of the conference, the court

598,13," At least one District Court case, McCluney v. Joseph Schlitz Brewing Co., 504 F. Supp. 1264 (E.D.Wis.1981), has prudently 
denied a party's motion for a discovery conference. Characterizing Rule 26 as ""designed to provide a framework to alleviate 
discovery abuses,"" District Judge Myron Gordon held that ""I am satisfied that the case at bar presents a discovery dispute 
sufficiently narrow that a discovery conference is not needed . . . The better course for the plaintiff to pursue is to bring a motion 
to compel discovery pursuant to Rule 37(a)."" Id. at 1270."

L. Rev. 893, 907 nn. 97-98 (1984). "
599,15," The leading commentators endorse this view. ""Rule 26(f) mandates the holding of a discovery conference upon proper motion 
by a party . . . The power of the court to enter orders establishing the scope, form, extent, and timing of discovery is thus clearly 
confirmed . . . "" Manual for Complex Litigation § 1.95 (5th ed. 1982). The Manual for Complex Litigation -- Second (1985) does 
not address the mandatory nature of a 26(f) motion. Rather, it seems to take for granted that a court will convene whatever 
""initial conferences"" -- including discovery conferences -- are necessary, normally on its own motion. The Manual, with its 
hallmark of active judicial management during pre-trial proceedings, thus assumes that formal motions such as 26(f), made by 
the litigant, will rarely be needed. See also 4 J. Moore, J. Lucas & G. Grotheer, Jr., Moore's Federal Practice § 26.85 (2d ed. 1986); Recommendations of the

Miller & F. Elliott, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2051 (1986). Many of these commentators point out the court's power to 
strike or deny a motion if it is frivolous or grounded in a narrow dispute."
599,16," Union City needed a protective order because the confidential business material discovered in the related case was itself 
originally placed under a protective order. Union City could thus gain access to that material only through a modification. This is 
what they moved for in this case."
599,17," ""For example, the 'issues' for identification and possible limitation under Rule 26(f) . . . in anti-trust proceedings could be such 
disputed matters as the nature of the agreement asserted to constitute the violation, its manifestation, its timing, the relevant 
product and geographical market, the time the plaintiff allegedly sustained injury from the asserted illegality, whether the plaintiff 
was a direct or indirect purchaser and, if an indirect purchaser, whether he bought under a cost-plus contract from one who 
purchased from the defendant . . . "" Recommendations of the American College of Trial Lawyers on Major Issues Affecting 
Complex Litigation, 90 F.R.D. at 217-18. Since Union City also pleaded a Robinson-Patman Act claim, we add that inquiry into 
the ""goods or services"" issue at an early stage was vital."
599,18," Admittedly, Union City has less than a spotless record for zealous prosecution of this case. Union City's request for discovery 
conference was not formally proper in every respect. Of the five requirements for a proper motion, Union City neglected to 
include the first element, that is, ""a statement of the issues as they then appear."" We do not condone Union City's careless 
omission of this element. Nevertheless, we feel confident that Union City's amended complaint served to articulate the issues in 
a specific enough manner. Furthermore, Union City did include what has been called the ""critical"" element in a discovery 
conference motion: it formally stated that it had reasonably but unsuccessfully attempted to reach agreement with opposing 
counsel regarding a discovery plan. FRCP 26(f)(5). The request for discovery conference was thus made properly after other, 
informal attempts had failed. We decline to view this procedural defect as fatal to Union City's request for judicial intervention. "
600,19," Rule 56(f) When Affidavits are Unavailable Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that he cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit 
facts essential to justify his opposition, the court may refuse the application for judgment or may order a continuance to 
permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make such other order as is just. "
601,20," For example, Union City lists items such as: [1.] Channel has the cancelled checks and the documents where the amounts to be paid were computed; [6.] Gerald A. Cabbage, Channel's controller, has knowledge of why the payments were made; and [12.] Channel, Saybolt, and other have knowledge or information relative to Saybolt's under-reporting Channel's purchases. Ant. Brief at 17-18."
601,21," We point out too, that the Supreme Court's language states ""Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment, after 
adequate time for discovery."" This is a very different animal from ""adequate discovery."" Over one year passed from the time 
Union City filed suit and defendants moved for summary judgment. This was the identical time period as in Celotex. Although "
602,," there was no claim of insufficient discovery in Celotex, the Supreme Court made allowance for premature motions by 
highlighting the availability of a Rule 56(f) continuance. 477 U.S. at    , 106 S. Ct. at 2554, 91 L. Ed. at 276. Accord, Fontenot, 
780 F.2d at 1194-95. Union City did not pursue Rule 56(f) relief. On appeal, -- with no formal 56(f) relief sought from or denied 
by the trial court -- we certainly cannot say that Union City had either inadequate time for discovery or inadequate discovery."
602,22," The brief language of § 1 of the Sherman Act HN9[
] prohibits ""every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations . . . "" 15 U.S.C. § 1."
602,23," Under an apparent authority theory, ""liability is based upon the fact that the agent's position facilitates the consummation of 
the fraud, in that from the point of view of the third person the transaction seems regular on its face and the agent appears to be 
acting in the ordinary course of the business confided to him."" Restatement (Second) of Agency § 261, comment a (1957)."
602,24," We here point out that the redelivery kickback scheme netted Nutter a penny a gallon, while Carbide was paying Channel only 
four to five cents a gallon for the service. Nutter's personal greed, then, increased his employer's cost by at least 20%. "
603,25," For example, in Spence & Green, at least the plaintiff there had filed one sworn response opposing summary judgment, to 
argue that he had been allowed insufficient discovery to respond. The memorandum was vague and conclusory, although still 
more specific and detailed than Union City's. In ruling on the moving party's motion for summary judgment, the District Court in 
Spence & Green rejected the contention of insufficient discovery as ""not having been sufficiently specific and otherwise as 
inadequate justification for Spence's failure to respond"" more fully to the opposing motion.  Spence & Green, 612 F.2d at 900-01."
603,26," Saybolt's motion was properly filed and independently supported. Gulf Coast's motion and papers, on the other hand, simply 
adopted and incorporated most of Carbide and Saybolt's argument as its own grounds for summary judgment. Nevertheless, 
because Union City's allegations of fact against Gulf Coast were as insufficient and vague as they were against Saybolt, the 
reasoning and decision affirming summary judgment for it is the same. "
604,27," The trouble, of course, is that treble damages are so tempting. Plaintiffs waste much of their money, and a court's time, 
chasing claims that simply have not a Peep to do with antitrust. See In re Municipal Bond Reporting Litigation, 672 F.2d 436, 440 
n. 7 (5th Cir.1982)."

604,29," A review of the reported cases demonstrates that dominant nature can properly be disposed of on summary judgment. See, 
e.g., Aviation Specialties, Inc. v. United Technologies Corp., 568 F.2d 1186 (5th Cir.1978) (summary judgment entered for 
defendant because sale of embodied parts woven into general repair agreement not a good); Tri-State Broadcasting Co. v. UPI, 
369 F.2d 268 (5th Cir.1966) (news information service a service); Satellite Television and Associated Resources, Inc. v. 
Continental Cablevision, 714 F.2d 351 (4th Cir.1983), cert. denied 465 U.S. 1027, 104 S. Ct. 1285, 79 L. Ed. 2d 688 (1984) 
(dominant nature of transaction was broadcasting, a service); Freeman v. Chicago Title & Trust Co., 505 F.2d 527 (7th Cir.1974) 
(title searches and insurance are services); Baum v. Investors Diversified Services, 409 F.2d 872 (7th Cir. 1969) (mutual fund is 
not a commodity). Union City has not sufficiently demonstrated that the nature, dominant or otherwise, of the redelivery contract 
and the gauging services was anything but of service. "
605,30," In the original complaint, Union Barge's state claims were for (i) interference with a contractual relationship, against Saybolt; 
and (ii) wrongful termination of contract, against Carbide. Union Fuel's state claim was for interference with its business 
relationships, against Carbide, Saybolt and Gulf Coast. In its memoranda in opposition to summary judgment, however, Union City stipulated that both of Union Barge's pendent claims 
should be dismissed. This stipulation, of course, acts to waive Union Barge's right to appeal those claims here. Thus, only Union 
Fuel's tort claim is before us."
605,31," Even though the Union City had already voluntarily dismissed Union Barge's state charges, the District Court nevertheless 
purported to rule on them. We need not consider the effect of the District Court's reading of Gibbs on those claims. Union City's 
voluntary dismissal renders the rulings nugatory. "

639,1," Section 7 provides in pertinent part: HN1[
] No person engaged in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or 
any part of the stock or other share capital . . . of another person engaged also in commerce, where in any line of commerce or

639,15, U.S.C. § 18. 
640,2," The Justice Department did examine the merger and, with the exception of a joint venture in an area not pertaining to 
methanol, did approve the acquisition of Conoco on July 30, 1981. The joint venture objection was resolved by a complaint and 
stipulated final judgment filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on August 4, 1981, Docket No. 81-
1837."
640,3," For collections of cases and commentary, see Note, Horizontal Mergers, Competitors, and Antitrust Standing Under Section 16 
of the Clayton Act: Fruitless Searches for Antitrust Injury, 70 Minn. L. Rev. 931 (1986); Note, Standing to Sue for Clayton Act 
Injunctions: Chrysler -- Injured Party or Disgruntled Competitor?, 31 Wayne L. Rev. 1275, 1283 (1985). "
642,4," Our fundamental difference with the dissent is its focus on the illegality and anti-competitiveness of the merger. The comments 
on intent, for example, are pertinent only to the issue of legality. But the district court assumed the merger violated § 7, as do we 
on this appeal. Thus, further discussion about the merits, or lack of them, of the merger are not really relevant. It seems also that the dissent is concerned with the long-range effects of the merger; however, most of Alberta's claimed injuries 
flow from the absence of the temporary, interim period of market stimulation. Plaintiffs do not, and could not, complain about the 
ultimate effect of the merger -- the prevention of a competitor's entry into the market. In short, as we see it, the question presented here is not whether the merger is socially undesirable, but whether these plaintiffs 
should be allowed to collect damages. That is quite a different question than whether the merger should be permitted. "
643,5," Thus, Alberta's alleged damages more closely resemble injuries flowing from a ""vertical foreclosure"" than injuries one would 
expect to follow from a horizontal merger. We believe, however, that in order for Alberta to maintain an action based on a vertical 
foreclosure theory, it would, at a minimum, have to demonstrate that a portion of the existing market has actually been 
foreclosed by the merger. Alberta, of course, cannot make such a showing in connection with its ""demand creation"" theory. "
644,6," Alberta says that it ""has an inherent competitive advantage over other methanol producers in the United States since it has 
access to large quantities of inexpensive natural gas, currently the raw material for producing methanol."" Brief for appellants at 
35. "
646,7," Alberta points to the fact that Conoco purchased only 6.2% of its consumption of 11.7 million gallons in 1979 from Du Pont, a 
total amounting to 2.1% of the merchant market. Alberta's own marketing plans made before the announcement of the merger 
anticipated sales to Conoco of only one million gallons in 1982. Even after the merger, however, Conoco bought methanol from 
outside sources and 81.5% from Du Pont. Therefore, the foreclosure of sales to Conoco in fact was not 100%."
646,8," See Areeda & Hovenkamp, 1986 Supplement § 520b 1, discussing the Department of Justice merger guidelines, ""captive 
production and consumption of the relevant product by vertically integrated firms are part of the overall market supply and 
demand."""
646,9," Alberta contends that the figures for 1980 and 1981 were aberrational because of an antidumping action brought against it by 
Du Pont. The pretrial stipulation shows Alberta's U.S. sales as 39 million gallons in 1978, 59 million in 1978, and 49 million in 
1977."
646,10," Judge Hunter agrees that the foreclosure is de minimis and does not establish a violation of § 7. Because he believes that the 
district court did not assume a § 7 violation as to the vertical claim, Judge Hunter would not address the additional question of 
whether Alberta was injured by the foreclosure. If the district court did assume a violation of § 7 in resolving the vertical claim, 
Judge Hunter would join in the court's opinion without that reservation. "
647,11," Because we affirm the grant of summary judgment for the defendant, we need not discuss the denial of the plaintiffs' motion 
for summary judgment. "
648,1," It should be noted, however, that the record contains very strong evidence that Conoco was indeed committed to develop a 
coal-to-methanol plant, as Alberta Gas alleges. Indeed, Conoco's plans to develop methanol were sufficiently firm that 
immediately before the merger, Conoco had begun advertising those plans to the public. See Appellant's opening br. at 12, 
citing A 7459, the text of a television advertisement broadcast during the 1981 Indianapolis 500 auto race, which stated that 
""Conoco will soon be testing passenger cars powered by methanol, and we're planning to produce this fuel from coal."""
648,2," This Court may review the record independently to determine whether there is an alternative ground for affirmance. But I 
believe that the size of this record suggests that that task be performed in the first instance by the district court. "
649,3," While the complaint also seeks injunctive relief, Alberta Gas did not seek a preliminary injunction. My understanding is that, at 
this juncture, Alberta Gas is interested primarily in money damages."
649,4," The majority concentrates its discussion of the vertical claims on the sales Alberta Gas would have made to Conoco if the latter 
company had not closed down its chemical manufacturing plants in New Jersey and Texas. As I explain more fully below, see 
typescript at 12-15, I do not understand Alberta Gas to focus on this point. "
650,5," The majority's error in focusing on the rise in price can also be seen clearly from the fact that Alberta Gas's complaint about lost 
profits would be essentially the same even if the market price for methanol did not rise at all. If all suppliers produced methanol 
with the same cost structure as Alberta Gas -- i.e., at constant marginal cost -- the market price would not have risen at all in 
response to an increase in demand. But profits would still have risen if demand increased. As the graph below explains, profits 
would have risen from the amount represented by area A to the sum of that area and area B. And Alberta Gas would still have 
lost profits as a result of DuPont's anticompetitive actions. [SEE ILLUSTRATION IN ORIGINAL] "
651,6," I also do not understand the majority's Brunswick-based argument that Alberta Gas's claim offends the principle that a plaintiff's 
injury in a § 7 case must stem from that which makes the merger illegal. See majority opinion, typescript at 16-17, citing 
Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 487 n.12. The majority observes that if DuPont later decides to go through with Conoco's plans to 
develop a coal-to-methanol plant, Alberta Gas will receive the same profits it would have received if Conoco had developed the 
plant itself. See majority opinion, typescript at 17. The majority concludes from this that ""Alberta's injuries were not proximately 
caused by the anticompetitive effects of the DuPont-Conoco merger, [so that] they do not flow from"" that which made the merger 
illegal under § 7 of the Clayton Act. The majority's point appears to be that because DuPont could have decided after the merger 
to continue with the plans, the merger itself is not the source of Alberta Gas's injury. Alberta Gas's point is that the merger was illegal because DuPont used it as a means to eliminate Conoco's coal-to-methanol 
plant. If DuPont had bought Conoco and continued Conoco's plans to build the plant, the merger would not have been illegal in 
the first place. The thing which made the merger illegal is therefore the thing which caused Alberta Gas's injury. "
652,7, See Appellee's br. at 24-25. 
655,1," Although plaintiffs asserted a claim for violation of the Sherman Act based on an alleged conspiracy between FC and FC & W

Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752 (1984). See pls. response to motion for summary judgment at 53 
n.15. "
657,2," Plaintiffs further argue, relying on Professor Carey's analysis, that FC's policy of selling discontinued inventory to Marshall's, a 
discount store, is not in accord with FC's concern about protecting its brand names and shows that FC's interest in licensing is 
not genuine. FC argues that there is no inconsistency between its restrictive sales policy for current merchandise and its 
decision to sell obsolete styles to discounters. Assuming that these policies are inconsistent, this evidence is plainly insufficient 
to establish the existence of an illegal conspiracy absent any evidence of a meeting of the minds between the defendants.

plaintiffs argue that the fact that the policy turned out to be successful does not establish that the policy was made for legitimate 
economic reasons. Pls.' sur-reply at 7. Similarly, evidence that the policy is unsuccessful does not prove that the policy was 
made for illegitimate reasons."
658,5," The facts and theory of conspiracy in Victorian House are distinguishable from the present case. In Victorian House, an

Sherman Act and that Federated's speech was the cause of Esprit's discontinuation of sales to plaintiff. The Second Circuit 
granted defendants' motions for summary judgment. "
660,7," It is doubtful that such an argument would prevail anyway, given the Supreme Court's approval of legitimate coordinated 
activities between manufacturers and distributors. Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 763-64."
660,8," Plaintiffs base their case substantially on Professor Areeda's theory of the ""coerced supplier."" However, Professor Areeda also 
recognizes that an agreement is central to a claim under section 1 of the Sherman Act and I conclude, for the reasons stated in 
this memorandum, that plaintiffs have failed to adduce evidence of an agreement between FC and Federated. Moreover, ""[t]he 
Supreme Court's Monsanto decision seemed to adopt an agreement concept that excludes the coercion theory."" 7 P. Areeda, 
Antitrust Law § 1457e at 175 (1986). "
661,9," Because I conclude that plaintiffs failed to adduce evidence which tends to exclude the likelihood that defendants acted 
independently, I need not reach defendants' alternative argument that even if plaintiffs established proof of a conspiracy, they 
must also establish an injury to competition. "
679,1," Kellam was originally an Arco distributor but in 1960 purchased Watson Oil Co. which sold Texaco products. Kellam distributed 
under both names until 1982 when Arco cancelled their contract. "
680,2," In 1981, Kellam distributed 4,213,126 gallons of gasoline for resale at the Super Soda Centers. This represents 22.3 % of all of 
Kellam's contract gasoline to third parties."
680,3," The Court will employ certain abbreviations. ""Dep."" will be used for Deposition' ""Aff."" for Affidavits; and ""Ex."" for Exhibits that 
correspond to the Depositions."
680,4," In April, 1982, defendant Duncan complained that the prices posted by Kellam were not sufficiently low to compete with other 
retail gasoline outlets. (Duncan Dep. at 405, 690, 692). Duncan also complained that the gasoline price posted at a Shore Stop 
in Milford, Delaware was lower than the retail price charged at a nearby Super Soda Center. (Duncan Dep. at 471). Rather than 
return to the initial distribution system, Nehi installed additional dispensing equipment at seven of the ten locations under 
contract with Kellam and began selling unbranded gasoline purchased on the spot market. "
681,5, The requirements provisions were contained in only three of the Nehi-Kellam contracts. See supra notes 5-7.
681,6," The six contracts contained the following provisions: (1) May 1, 1975 contract for Smyrna, Delaware: 15 year term; (2) July 1, 1975 contract for Camden, Delaware: 15 year term; (3) May 5, 1975 contract for Cambridge, Maryland: 15 year term; (4) September 14, 1977 contract for Seaford, Delaware: 15 year term; exclusive agreement for entire location; purchase of 
equipment at replacement cost plus the cost of installation; (5) March 20, 1978 contract for Salisbury Road, Dover: 15 year term; exclusive agreement for entire location; purchase of 
equipment at replacement cost plus the cost of installation; (6) March 21, 1979 contract for State Street, Dover: 15 year term; exclusive agreement for entire location; purchase of 
equipment at replacement cost plus the cost of installation. See Ap. at A11-A23. "
682,7, The old 1960 Contract form did not specify any quantity of gasoline to be delivered:
682,2," . SALE AND DELIVERY. BUYER shall buy from SHORE and SHORE shall sell and deliver to BUYER for sale from said 
equipment,     gallons of motor fuel annually; Nor did Kellam's printed form specify the period of time for which it would run. Kellam contends that the durational term was 
intentionally left blank because no two installations were the same. Where Kellam was to make a ""top-of-the-line"" equipment 
investment, Kellam always insisted on long-term contracts. (Ap. at A36; contract with McGinnis Delicatessen).  Less costly 
installations merited shorter contract terms. (Ap. at A7). The final contract term concerns the disposition of the equipment installation upon termination of the agreement. Kellam's 
representatives left blank lines in the contract regarding what price would be paid by a retailer for gas tanks at the end of the 
contract period. The provision reads: Upon cancellation by SHORE for any breach and exercise by SHORE of its rights to remove equipment BUYER shall pay 
to SHORE the sum of     Dollars ($   ) as reimbursement for the agreed upon cost of installation and removal of the 
equipment and improvement, or, at its option, SHORE may leave the equipment in place and upon demand BUYER shall 
pay the sum of     Dollars ($   ) the agreed upon value of the equipment and improvements and upon payment title thereto 
shall pass to BUYER. A 1960's contract form was used for the Super Sodas at Smyrna, Camden and Cambridge, Maryland. All these contracts and 
arrangements were reviewed by the Federal Energy Administration as part of a routine compliance audit in 1975. The Agency 
determined that Kellam's gasoline operations were in compliance with the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act and regulations 
promulgated thereunder. (Polk Kellam Aff.  para. 4)."
682,8," A different set of contracts was used by Kellam for the Super Sodas in Seaford, Salisbury Road and State Street. They derived 
from a 1976 contract form that Kellam adopted after changing its name from Shore Atlantic, Inc. (Polk Kellam Aff. para. 6). 
According to Kellam, the contract memorialized Kellam's long-standing practice. The length of the contract was again left blank 
on the contract form, but the 1976 contract explicitly stated that Kellam reserved the right to have Super Sodas purchase the 
dispensing equipment ""at the then current price for similar equipment."" Kellam understood this to mean the market value of 
tanks of the same age and in the same condition as those being sold. (Kellam Aff. para. 7; App. at A18). The Contract reads: Any equipment attached to the realty, such as underground equipment, shall, if Kellam so desires, be purchased by Buyer 
from Kellam at the then current price for similar equipment, taking into consideration the cost of installing such equipment. The contract also specifically stated that the buyer agrees to purchase from Kellam all of buyer's requirements. The 1976 
contract form stated:"
682,2," . Kellam agrees to sell to Buyer and Buyer agrees to purchase from Kellam all of Buyer's entire supply of gasoline and 
diesel fuel which Buyer dispenses at the above described location. In the late 1970's, the Department of Energy, the successor to the Federal Energy Administration, also reviewed these particular 
Kellam contracts and decided that they complied with federal price regulations. (Kellam Aff. para. 5). "
683,9," This litigation is lengthy: it is almost three years old and the parties are just now completing discovery. It is voluminous: the 
parties exchanged almost 62,000 documents. And it is complex: the parties deposed 47 witnesses, generating approximately 
7,200 pages of transcript. See, Kellam Energy, Inc. v. Duncan, 616 F. Supp. 215 (D.Del. 1985). See also, Kellam Energy, Inc. v. 
Duncan, slip op. No. 84-479-CMW (D.Del. Dec. 9, 1986)."
683,10," Before Matsushita, the common wisdom was that summary judgment was particularly inappropriate in complex civil litigations, 
especially antitrust actions. See Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting Co., 368 U.S. 464, 7 L. Ed. 2d 458, 82 S. Ct. 486 (1962). (""We 
believe that summary procedures should be used sparingly in complex antitrust litigations were motive and intent play leading 
roles, the proof is largely in the hands of the alleged conspirators, and hostile witnesses thicken the plot."").  368 U.S. at 473."
683,11," Matsushita shifts the burden to the non-moving party to come forward with evidence to permit a trier of fact to find that the 
defendants conspired to violate the antitrust laws. Absent the existence of sufficient unambiguous evidence of the conspiracy, "
684,," summary judgment is mandated. This amounts to an invitation to district courts in appropriate cases to weigh the sufficiency of 
the evidence presented as well as the plausibility of the underlying theory of the plaintiff's cause of action."
684,12," First, the Court determined that HN5[
] a party moving for summary judgment need not engage every possible basis for the 
claimant's theory in order to prevail on the motion.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 
(1986). Second, the HN6[
] Court equated the standards governing summary judgment with those governing directed verdicts, 
determining that the non-movant bears the burden of coming forward with evidence sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find in 
its favor.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91. L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). Finally, the Court 
determinated that HN7[
] a party asserting an inherently inplausible claim must make an even greater evidentiary showing in 
order to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Matsushita."
684,13," In complex civil litigation, therefore, the Supreme Court's recent decisions have made summary judgment a powerful new 
weapon in the hands of defendants. See Apex Oil Co. v. DiNauro, 641 F. Supp. 1246, 1256 (S.D.N.Y. 1986) (the Supreme 
Court's recent opinions, particularly those in Monsanto and Matsushita, signal a marked change from the reticence to grant 
summary judgment of Poller, a change spurred, perhaps, by the onslaught of massive antitrust litigation over the last 20 years 
and the attendant stress on the administration of justice.)."
684,14," The Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 (""EPAA"") (Pub.L. 93-159, 15 U.S.C. § 751 et seq.) required the President to 
regulate the price and allocation of crude oil and petroleum products. The purposes of the EPAA were set forth in § 4(b)(1) of 
that statute, 15 U.S.C. § 753(b)(1). Among these were: "
685,," (D) preservation of an economically sound and competitive petroleum industry: including the priority needs to restore and 
foster competition . . . and to preserve the competitive viability of . . . nonbranded independent marketers, and branded 
independent marketers; [and]. . . . (F) equitable distribution of . . . refined petroleum products at equitable prices among all regions and areas of the United 
States and sectors of the petroleum industry, including . . . nonbranded independent marketers and branded independent 
marketers. . . ."
685,15," 10 C.F.R. 210 62(a) provided that: HN11[
] Suppliers will deal with purchasers of an allocated product according to normal business practices in effect during 
the base period specified in Part 211 for that allocated product, and no supplier may modify any normal business practice 
so as to result in the circumvention of any provision of this chapter. Part 211 specified calendar year 1972 as the base period for sales of motor gasoline. 10 C.F.R. 211.102 (1978)."
685,16," During the same period, § 210.62(b) provided that: HN12[
] No supplier shall engage in any form of discrimination among purchasers of any allocated product. For purposes 
of this paragraph, ""discrimination"" means extending any preference or sales treatment which has the effect of frustrating or 
impairing the objective, purposes and intent of this chapter or of the [EPAA]. . . ."
685,17," Throughout the relevant period, 10 C.F.R. 210.62(c) provided that: HN13[
] ""any practice which constitutes a means to obtain a price higher than is permitted by the regulations in this 
chapter or to impose terms or conditions not customarily imposed upon the sale of an allocated product is a violation of 
these regulations. Such practices include, but are not limited to . . . tie-in agreements. . . ."" "
686,18," See, e.g. Bodenweiser Contract (Selbyville) dated August 11, 1977 (12.5 years); M/M Becker Contract (R & I Market) dated 
March 23, 1977 (10 years); Elwood Young Contract (Young's) dated April 1, 1977 (5 years). See Ap. at A1-A30. "
687,19, The requirements provisions were contained in only three of the Nehi-Kellam contracts. See supra notes 5-7.
687,20," The purported violation regarding the equipment purchase term of the contracts applies only to one Super Soda Center at 
Seaford and to two Super Soda Centers at Dover. See supra notes 6-7."
687,21," Defendants have the burden of establishing Kellam's normal business practices prior to May 15, 1973.  Gulf Oil, 553 F. Supp. 
499, 510 (E.D. Pa. 1982). The record, however, contains no evidence concerning the terms and conditions upon which Kellam "
688,," actually sold tanks and dispensing equipment during this period. Defendants only ""evidence"" consists of a series of contracts 
with blank price terms. This cannot carry defendants' burden of proof."
688,22," The Court need not consider other arguments raised by plaintiff such as the question of whether the defendants' affirmative 
defense of illegality of contract is barred by the statute of limitations or whether, if the contracts were declared in violation of the 
regulations, they were revived when the petroleum regulations were lifted in 1981. "
689,23," The gasoline requirements contracts for the Smyrna, Camden and Cambridge Super Soda Centers contain the following 
pricing term:"
689,3," . PRICE AND TERMS. BUYER shall pay for all products delivered hereunder the price established from time to time by 
SHORE for buyers in the same classification as BUYER in effect at the time and place of delivery to BUYER. . . . The contracts for the Seaford, Dover # 1, Dover # 2 and Milford Super Soda Centers similarly state:"
689,3," . Buyer shall pay for all products delivered hereunder the price established from time to time by Kellam for buyers in the 
same classification as Buyer in effect at the time and place of delivery to Buyer. "
690,24," Nehi's discussion of TCP Industries, Inc. v. Uniroyal, Inc., 661 F.2d 542 (6th Cir. 1981) is inapposite because that case did not 
concern an open contract term. Rather, that case dealt with a contractual provision that was fiercely negotiated.  Id. at 548. It 
was entirely different than the contract in the case at bar which, Nehi maintains, was not even read before it was signed."
690,25," In denying Kellam's Motion for Summary Judgment on Nehi's breach of contract counterclaim, the Court need not weigh 
Nehi's other arguments as to why the contract counterclaim should survive. The trier of fact need not consider the other theories 
advanced in support of Nehi's motion: (1) that the promise to keep Nehi competitive constituted a separate and enforceable ""oral 
agreement""; (2) that Nehi detrimentally relied on Kellam's promise; or (3) that there was an implied covenent that obligated 
Kellam to provide Nehi with the lowest prices in the market. "
691,26," Nehi might have alleged the common law tort of restraint of trade. See vonKalinowski § 1.03[4]. Such a common law cause of 
action encompasses practices like Resale Price Maintenance and Exclusive Dealing. See, e.g., United States v. Addyston Pipe 
& Steel Co., 85 Fed. 271 (6th Cir. 1898), aff'd., 175 U.S. 211, 20 S. Ct. 96, 44 L. Ed. 136 (1899). But no such common law 
practices were alleged here. "
692,27," HN30[
] ""It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, to lease or make a sale 
or contract for sale of goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies or other commodities, whether patented or unpatented, 
for use, consumption or resale within the United States or any Territory thereof or the District of Columbia or any insular 
possession or other place under the jurisdiction of the United States, or fix a price charged therefor, or discount from, or rebate 
upon, such price, on the condition, agreement or understanding that the lessee or purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the 
goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies, or other commodities of a competitor or competitors of the lessor or seller, 
where the effect of such lease, sale, or contract for sale or such condition, agreement or understanding may be to substantially 
lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce."" 15 U.S.C. § 14 (1976)."
692,28," HN31[
] ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce 
among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any contract or engage 
in any combination or conspiracy declared by sections 1 or 7 of this title to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on 
conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding one million dollars if a corporation, or, if any other person, one 
hundred thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding three years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the 
court."" 15 U.S.C. § 1 (1976). "
693,29," Nehi is trying to create a tying claim out of an exclusive dealing contract. Tying and exclusive dealings are different types of 
conduct requiring proof of different elements. Tying requires a purchaser who desires to buy product A also buy some quantity of 
product B. Exclusive dealings requires a purchaser, who desires to buy product A to refrain from buying any of product A from a 
different supplier. Steuer, Exclusive Dealing in Distribution, 69 Cornell L.Rev. 101, 104 n.18 (1983). See Bork, The Antitrust 
Paradox 365 (1978). "
694,30," An alternative holding for granting summary judgment is a Supreme Court case that specifically upheld the arrangement 
between the parties here. In FTC v. Sinclair Refining Co., 261 U.S. 463, 67 L. Ed. 746, 43 S. Ct. 450 (1922), the Court held that 
Sinclair Refining's practice of leasing underground tanks with pumps to retail dealers at nominal rentals upon the condition that 
the equipment shall be used only with Sinclair's gasoline was not violative of the Clayton Act. This undercuts Nehi's claims under 
both the Clayton and the Sherman Acts because the former statute imposes a tighter restraint on competitive behavior than 
does the latter. HN40[
] Conduct ""which satisfies the test of legality set out in the Clayton Act would a fortiori be lawful under 
the less stringent Sherman Act."" American Motor Inns, Inc. v. Holiday Inns, 521 F.2d 1230, 1250 (3d Cir. 1975). Nehi does not 
dispute the validity of Sinclair's holding."
694,31," The Court, therefore, does not have to consider the parties' arguments concerning the third and fourth elements of the tying 
claims: whether Nehi can prove sufficient economic power in the tying market to appreciably affect the tied market or whether a 
""not insubstantial"" amount of commerce in the ""tied market"" has been affected. "
696,32," Note that the market for an exclusive dealing claim can be different than the market for an attempted monopolization claim. In 
the former, the courts are concerned with the market in the product that is the subject of arrangement. In the latter, courts are 
concerned about a defendant exercising monopoly power in the claimants' market. See infra note 33."
696,33," HN50[
] A mere showing that the exclusive arrangement involves a substantial number of dollars is insufficient to prove a 
significant anti-competitive effect.  Susser v. Carvel Corp., 332 F.2d 505, 516 (2d Cir. 1964). When exclusive dealing is "
697,," condemned, it is because it substantially forecloses the opportunity for the seller's competitors to enter into or remain in the 
market.  Tampa Electric Co., 365 U.S. at 327, 328. HN51[
] Anticompetitive effect in an exclusive dealing contest is measured 
in the seller's market, not the buyer's. See T.A.M., Inc. v. Gulf Oil Corp., 553 F. Supp. 499, 505 (E.D.Pa. 1982)."
697,34," Plaintiffs urge this Court to adopt the Seventh Circuit's exclusive dealing test as created in Roland Machinery Co. v. Dresser 
Industries, Inc., 749 F.2d 380 (7th Cir. 1984). This two part test requires claimant to prove that an exclusive dealing arrangement 
will keep at least one significant competitor of the defendant from doing business and second that the probable effect of the 
exclusion will be to raise prices above the competitive level. HN52[
] The Court declines to adopt this test and does not have to 
because it finds that, as a matter of law, Nehi could not meet the qualitative substantiality test outlined in American Motor Inns, 
Inc. v. Holiday Inns, 521 F.2d 1230 (3d Cir. 1975)."
697,35," Section 1 of the Sherman Act, HN55[
] requires proof of a ""contract, combination, . . . or conspiracy."" Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp., 561 F.2d 434, 445-46 (3d Cir. 1977), cert.denied, 434 U.S. 1086, 55 L. Ed. 2d 791, 98 S. Ct. 1280 (1978). ""Unilateral 
action, no matter what its motivation, cannot violate Section 1."" Edward J. Sweeney & Sons, Inc. v. Texaco, Inc., 637 F.2d 105, 
110 (3d Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 911, 68 L. Ed. 2d 300, 101 S. Ct. 1981 (1981); accord, Harold Friedman, Inc. v. 
Kroger Co., 581 F.2d 1068, 1071 (3d Cir. 1978). A finding that Nehi is an independent agent would provide the requisite co-
conspirator with whom Kellam would conspire. "
698,36," The Court concurs with Kellam that Nehi's reliance on Automatic Comfort Corp. v. D & R Service, 620 F. Supp. 1349 (D.C. 
Conn. 1985) is misplaced because that case was a Petroleum Marketing Act action."
698,37," Kellam suggests that because the commissioned agent system did not apply to thousands of dealers in a vast geographic 
area, as did the consignment question invalidated in Simpson, that no violation can be made out. In 1984, the company had 
requirements arrangements with 35 company-owned outlets and 74 third party outlets. (Polk Kellam Aff. paras. 13, 18). But 
Kellam may be a significant player in the geographically isolated Delmarva Peninsula market. As such it may meet the Simpson 
requirements; indeed, the Court notes that the rigid requirements of Simpson cannot be applied in every case. "
699,38," Consider the Deposition of Robert Duncan, Nehi's owner: Q. Okay. Under today's system [metering] you set the retail price, correct?A. Yes. Q. Has anyone from the Kellam organization ever told you what that retail price should be?A. Under the current system?Q. 
Under the current system. A. No.Q. So it is entirely your decision, correct?A. Yes.Q. They have never pushed you for any 
particular price? A. No. (Duncan Dep. at 449-50)."
699,39," HN59[
] ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or 
persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed 
guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding one million dollars if a corporation, or, if any 
other person, one hundred thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding three years, or by both said punishments, in the 
discretion of the court."" 15 U.S.C. § 2 (1976)."
699,40," Because Nehi's expert's have not even attempted to demonstrate a monopoly in the market, as defined by Nehi, the monopoly 
counterclaim is dismissed. HN60[
] In order to maintain an action for monopoly, under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, a claimant must prove not only the relevant market but that the defendant possesses actual monopoly power, meaning the power 
to control prices or exclude competition.  U.S. v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778, 86 S. Ct. 1698 (1966). There is 
no evidence that Kellam has that power here. "
700,41," Defining the relevant product market for purposes of an attempted monopolization claim is different than defining the market 
for an exclusive dealing claim. See supra Section III, C. 2. In an exclusive dealing context, the law is only concerned with the 
market in the product under contract; in the attempted monopolization context, a defendant may attempt to use the product 
under contract to gain monopoly in a different market. "
703,42," HN67[
] A dangerous probability of success can also be inferred from proof of another element of an attempted 
monopolization claim -- specific intent to monopolize.  Lessig v. Tidewater Oil Co., 327 F.2d 459, 474 (9th Cir.), cert.  denied, 
377 U.S. 993, 84 S. Ct. 1920, 12 L. Ed. 2d 1046 (1964). But see Walsh Trucking. The Third Circuit has not specifically adopted 
this standard and neither does this Court because there is sufficient evidence of both market share and of other factors to 
demonstrate a dangerous probability of success. But the Court does note that there is ample evidence on the record of specific intent to monopolize. Kellam intended to make 
Shore Stop ""the primary retailer of automotive fuels on the Delmarva Peninsula."" (Storey Ex. 23). Their marketing strategy for 
Shore Stop was to ""saturate"" the Peninsula and ""to be competitive in taking over key locations in order that it might pre-empt and 
limit competition in its marketing area."" (E. Polk Kellam Dep. pp. 563 and 566-567). Internal documents reveal that Kellam had a 
plan to edge out Super Soda from the convenience store industry by creating, in addition to Shore Stop, Kellam's own line of 
discount centers: ""Based on current economic situations, it has become increasingly imperative that we take a more critical look 
at their [Super Soda's] product mix to determine ways of borrowing some of their customers indefinitely."" [sic]. (Struble Ex. 8; Dr. 
Aff. H-5)."
703,43," Summary judgment is, however, granted with respect to para. 55 of Count III of the Amended Counterclaim and Nehi will not 
be permitted to put on evidence of price fixing during the metering period from January 1984 to January 1985. Similarly, Summary Judgment is granted with respect to Count VI insofar as it alleges that Kellam actually monopolized the 
market for convenience stores that sell gas. There is no evidence of this. "
706,1," During the period 1976-1978, Odishelidze voluntarily left Aetna to work for another insurance company. "
707,2," It is pleaded in the complaint that Aetna Life and Casualty Co. is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the 
State of Connecticut, with its principal place of business in Puerto Rico. Docket document No. 1, averment 21. That alone, 
defeats diversity jurisdiction.  28 U.S.C. sec. 1332 and Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 7 U.S. (3 Cranch) 267, 2 L. Ed. 435 (1806)."
707,3," Defendants aver that plaintiff's cause of action does not comply with Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) as to specificity of the claim. Plaintiff 
opposes alleging that all his facts are well pleaded. For purposes of our jurisdictional threshold inquiry, we examine the issue 
under the light shed by plaintiff's so insistently alleged ""well-pleaded facts,"" taking them as true."
707,4," Defendant Aetna has alleged to be exempt from the antitrust laws as provided in the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. secs. 
1011-1015. Such allegation is without merit. It is firmly established that HN2[
] such exemption applies only to the business of 
insurance, to wit: The relations between insurer-insured. See Group Life Health Insurance Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440 U.S. 205, 
59 L. Ed. 2d 261, 99 S. Ct. 1067 (1979); 15 U.S.C. sec. 1013(b)."
707,5," A failure to conspire is not a conspiracy. Morrison v. Murray Biscuit Co., 797 F.2d 1430, 1435 (7th Cir. 1986). "
708,6," Aetna terminated their relationship with independent agents. This by no means established barriers of entry into the insurance 
market nor impede the agents to continue in their business of selling other insurance companies' policies. No antitrust violation 
can ensue under this pattern."
708,7," Section 1964 reads: Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in 
any appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, 
including a reasonable attorney's fee."
708,8," 18 U.S.C. sec. 1961(4) defines enterprise to include any association, individual, partnership, corporation or other legal entity. "
713,1," HN1[
] Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides in part that, ""every contract . . . in restraint of trade . . . is declared to be illegal."""
713,2," The parties had specifically agreed before trial that the damages vel non from the three statutory claims should not be added 
together, unless the award from the Dealers' Day in Court Act claim exceeded that from the antitrust claim, the difference to be 
cumulated. "
714,3," The district court had instructed the jury that, ""A manufacturer may legally require its dealers to carry an inventory 
representative of its full line of products. . . . If the full-line forcing is coupled with quantity purchase or inventory requirements 
that effectively preclude a dealer from other competitive sources, however, then the supplier would be requiring purchases 
beyond the full line that consumers expect. It is for you to decide whether [two distinct products] exist here."" Trial Transcript at 
2190. Moreover at oral argument, counsel for the appellee specified that the appellee did not question the legality of the full-line 
requirement. "

] Once a plaintiff has established that separate products are involved, he must then demonstrate that the seller has 
market power in the tying product market, and that the effect of the tie-in arrangement is to foreclose a not insubstantial amount 
of commerce in the tied product market. Because we base this decision on the separate products issue, we do not reach the 
questions of whether Chrysler had sufficient market power to impose a tie, and whether the alleged tie impacted on a not 
insubstantial amount of commerce."
715,5," The appellee mistakenly relies on United States v. Loew's Inc., 371 U.S. 38, 9 L. Ed. 2d 11, 83 S. Ct. 97 (1962), for the 
proposition that a different level of demand for products ostensibly selling within the same product market creates separate 
products. The court in Loew's, however, did not address this issue, instead holding that the holder of a copyright has sufficient 
""market power"" to impose an illegal tie. "
716,6," This generous principle does not obtain regarding the claim under the Dealers' Day in Court Act, which would be governed by 
usual tort principles. Although we have reversed on the antitrust claim, the appellee could possibly recover on remand on the 
unfair trade practices claim. Because the unfair trade practices claim encompasses federal antitrust law, the principle reflected 
in Zenith Radio is applicable, and thus we address the damages issue in light of it. "
725,1," The term ""screen"" refers to the set reimbursement rate which BCBSM will pay a health care provider for a specific procedure. 
This reimbursement rate is the amount which BCBSM deems the usual, customary, and reasonable charge for the procedure. "
726,2," Chrysler Corporation was cognizant of the high costs of foot surgery and began discussing this cost problem with MSPA as 
early as 1975. The minutes of these discussions reveal that a large part of the problem was admittedly due to certain podiatrists' 
abuse of third part insurer reimbursement systems. Hence, Chrysler asked BCBSM to design a predetermination program which 
would correct the problem of high utilization of foot surgery. Notably, a study done by BCBSM of the 50 types of surgery for 
which BCBSM most frequently reimbursed health care providers in 1979 revealed that, of the top 25, 19 were procedures which 
were mainly performed by podiatrists."
726,3," The Board of Directors of BCBSM is the body which has overall decision-making authority for BCBSM. During the time period 
relevant to this case, the BCBSM Board had 47 members. Of these members, 27 were consumer representatives, 19 were 
provider representatives, and 1 was the President of BCBSM. The provider representatives included 9 physicians, of whom 7 
were MDs."
726,4," The BCBSM Corporate Body is the group which selects the Board of Directors from its membership. During the relevant time 
period, the Corporate Body was composed of 90 persons, 54 of which were consumer representatives and 14 of whom were 
MDs. "
727,5," The composition of the regional cost containment committees established by BCBSM was at variance with that suggested by 
the MSMS Physician Liaison Committee. The Committee had recommended that the regional committees be composed of three 
MDs, one DO, and two consumers appointed by BCBSM. This suggestion was rejected by BCBSM."
727,6," The Memorandum Opinion and Order issued in this case on March 20, 1986 indicated that the class could not include those 
podiatrists who practiced in Michigan from 1978 to October 8, 1983 as to the screen reductions. Memorandum Opinion and 
Order at 7. Thus, the class members only have an action for the screen reductions occurring on October 9, 1983.  Although the 
Court reversed its ruling denying class certification to the class on that date, its later decision to grant class certification did not 
disturb its conclusion as to which screen reductions were applicable to the class."
727,7," The Court's Memorandum Opinion and Order of March 20, 1986 dismissed Count II of the class complaint. See Harper v. 
BCBSM, et al., No. 85-1567, et seq. (E.D. Mich. March 20, 1986) (order denying class certification). "
728,8," HN7[
] The Sherman Act is criminal in character when the Department of Justice prosecutes the lawsuit. When private parties such as the present plaintiffs pursue a Section 1 lawsuit, those parties may seek equitable relief under Sections 15 and 16 of the 
Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. secs. 12-27.  A private party may also seek damages for violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. 
Pursuant to Section 4 of the Clayton Act, the damages which shall be awarded are treble the damages sustained plus the cost of 
the lawsuit. The costs of the lawsuit statutorily include a reasonable attorney's fee. The plaintiffs in the present case seek both 
injunctive relief and treble damages. "
731,9," Notably, the structure of the ""Blues"" in Michigan underwent great changes in 1975. In that year, the Michigan Hospital Service 
and Blue Shield submitted a joint plan of consolidation to Daniel Demlow, then the Insurance Commissioner of Michigan. This 
plan was approved on January 23, 1975. The corporation consolidated under the plan was Blue Cross and Blue Shield of 
Michigan. Under the plan, the board of directors and the corporate membership had a composition which was very different from 
that of the predecessor corporations. Additionally, the BCBSM bylaws established special committees to assist the BCBSM 
operations. Because of these huge alterations in the corporate structure, the historical structure of the predecessor corporations 
is of little importance to the present case."

735,12," The majority of courts previously reaching this question have determined that a Rule of Reason analysis should be used. See 
Brillhart v. Mutual Medical Insurance, Inc., 768 F.2d 196 (7th Cir. 1985); Pennsylvania Dental Ass'n v. Medical Service Ass'n of

745,1," In order to become an ASR, one had to apply, submit credit references, be approved, and pay an application fee of $ 450.00. "
746,2," In 1982, Ad-Vantage was expelled from the ranks of ASR's by the NYPSA for failure to pay several of its publishers. Mr. 
Blumberg's new company was readmitted as an ASR, only to be expelled for nonpayment of bills in 1985. "
748,3," This lack of substitutability is referred to as a lack of ""cross-elasticity"" and was first addressed by the Supreme Court in Times-
Picayune Publishing Company v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 612 n. 31, 73 S. Ct. 872, 882 n. 31, 97 L. Ed. 1277 (1953), where 
the court used the concept to support its conclusion that advertising in other media was not a close enough substitute for 
newspaper advertising to be included in the same market. Here we simply use that same concept to support the jury's decision 
that Yellow Pages advertising was not in the same market as other advertising media."

750,5," It was undisputed that GTEDC had a lawful monopoly to publish the directories, by virtue of its contract with the various 
telephone companies. This is not a case where a competing publisher sues the ""official"" publisher. Cf.  White Directory 
Publishers, Inc. v. New York Telephone, 1981-2 Trade Cas. (CCH) para. 64,268 (S.D.N.Y. 1981) [Available on WESTLAW, DCT 
database]. "
751,6," The Supreme Court has made clear that a dual-distribution system dressed to look like an agency will not escape the reach of 
the Sherman Act. Simpson v. Union Oil Co., 377 U.S. 13, 84 S. Ct. 1051, 12 L. Ed. 2d 98 (1964). Such is not the case here. "
752,7," The only other court to handle a similar Yellow Pages case, of which we are aware, came to the same conclusion. In Best 
Advertising v. Illinois Bell Telephone Company, 229 F. Supp. 275 (S.D. Ill. 1964), aff'd, 339 F.2d 1009 (7th Cir. 1965), Illinois Bell 
published its own directory. The Reuben H. Donnelly Company had a contract to serve as the exclusive sales representative for "
753,," the Bell Yellow Pages in Illinois. Best Advertising submitted advertising for some of its clients to Donnelly for inclusion in one of 
Bell's directories. Donnelly refused to accept the advertising, and Best Advertising sued, claiming violations of the Sherman Act. 
The district court dismissed the case for failure to state a claim, noting, inter alia, that ""it is apparent upon the face of the 
complaint that neither of the parties is in competition with either of the other parties, thus, Donnelly's refusal to deal with the 
plaintiff does not have any tendency whatsoever to stifle competition."" Id. 229 F. Supp. 277. The court of appeals affirmed 
without addressing this issue, however, holding that the plaintiff failed to show an impact on interstate commerce.  Best, 339 
F.2d at 1012. Coincidentally, the plaintiff in Best also claimed to offer Yellow Pages advertising to its clients at a ""substantial 
savings."""
753,8," The Aspen case involved the operators of ski resorts in the Aspen, Colorado region, who competed with each other for 
customers. Each offered potential skiers different services, i.e., the opportunity to ski at different resorts. It was uncontested on 
appeal in Aspen that the parties were competitors in a relevant geographic market.  Aspen, 105 S. Ct. at 2856, n. 26."
753,9," Nor do we find Ad-Vantage's argument that ""every local advertiser is a potential national account"" to be persuasive. The 
NYPSA guidelines establish a distinction between national and local advertising. An ASR does not ""compete"" for local ads: it "
754,," places them with GTEDC's permission. ASRs may contact local advertisers to see if they can drum up interest in national 
advertising, but this does not change the market structure. "
755,10," In its reply brief GTEDC attempts to argue that its objections regarding the court's failure to instruct the jury that the existence 
of malice is relevant to a tortious interference with business relationship claim covers the same territory as an objection to the 
word ""necessary."" We do not see that malice is related to necessity. Moreover, the record does not reflect, either in the charge 
conference, or the motions filed post-judgment, that GTEDC was unhappy with the court's final instruction (or lack thereof) with 
respect to malice in the tort context. "
756,11," The plaintiff's burden regarding proof of lost profits is not as strict under federal antitrust law. See Lehrman v. Gulf Oil Corp., 
464 F.2d 26, 45 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1077, 93 S. Ct. 687, 34 L. Ed. 2d 665 (1972); Malcolm v. Marathon Oil  Co., 
642 F.2d 845, 858 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1125, 102 S. Ct. 975, 71 L. Ed. 2d 113 (1981); Graphic Products, 717 F.2d 
at 1580 n. 38. However, given that we have now reversed the anti-trust award, the compensatory damages must stand on its 
own under Florida tort law. "
757,12," Ad-Vantage also argues that its failure to include Mr. Blumberg's income as an expense is made up for by the fact that its 
damage study generously apportioned Ad-Vantage's total expenses to production of profit on the lost accounts. This is 
irrelevant. Mr. Blumberg's salary must be prorated as an expense. The fact that Ad-Vantage claimed to be conservative in 
assessing its damages does not allow it to ignore Florida law."
757,13," HN20[
] A directed verdict on the amount of damages is proper only in the most unusual circumstances.  Malcolm v. Marathon Oil, 642 F.2d 845, 858-60 n. 24 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1125, 102 S. Ct. 975, 71 L. Ed. 2d 113. Even 
where a district court's refusal to instruct the jury on lost profits is not appealed, the failure of the plaintiff to establish such profits 
""with reasonable certainty by competent proof"" under Florida law is grounds for a new trial on that issue where the appellant 
challenges the sufficiency of the evidence.  T.D.S. Inc. v. Shelby Mutual Ins. Co., 760 F.2d 1520, 1533 n. 14 (11th Cir. 1985), 
reh'g gr. in part, mod. on other grounds, reh. den. in part, T.D.S., Inc. v. Shelby Mut. Ins. Co., 769 F.2d 1485 (11th Cir. 1985). "
758,14," Contrary to Ad-Vantage's assertions, the Eighth Circuit has decided that treble damages on an antitrust count and punitive 
damages on a state law count are duplicative.  SuperTurf, Inc. v. Monsanto Co., 660 F.2d 1275 (8th Cir. 1981). Given our 
disposition of the case we decline to address the issue at this time. "
769,1, A full description of the defendants is set forth in Wilk and will not be repeated here. 
772,2," The Committee worked to influence legislation on the state and federal levels and engaged in informational activities to inform 
the public on the nature of chiropractic. All of this activity is protected under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine and I have not relied 
on any such conduct in reaching any conclusion in this case. The Wilk Court specifically approved the jury instruction used in the 
first trial that stated that defendants' advocacy activity directed to legislative and administrative agencies or bodies was protected 
if the ""defendants undertook such efforts to influence governmental actions that they sought."" 719 F.2d at 229."
772,3," The Judicial Council is now known as the Council on Judicial and Ethical Affairs, but I shall refer to it in this opinion by its 
original name. "
773,4," The JCAH accreditation standards prior to 1983 did not permit a hospital to allow chiropractors on the medical staff or to obtain 
hospital privileges, except to the extent allowed by state law. The legality of JCAH's actions prior to the 1983 revisions to the 
JCAH standards, and the responsibility of the member owners for such actions, will be discussed fully in the section of this 
opinion dealing with JCAH. I do not find that the AMA, or any other member of JCAH, is legally responsible for the pre-1983 
accreditation standards. "
775,5," Dr. Sammons was a willing participant in the conspiracy. As an AMA trustee, Dr. Sammons was on the Committee on 
Quackery Oversight Panel of the Board of Trustees of the AMA and recommended continued funding of the Committee with 
knowledge that its prime mission was to be to contain and eliminate chiropractic. Dr. Sammons presently is the Executive Vice 
President of the AMA. "
776,6," The matter is so clear that in 1979 an AMA lawyer agreed that a medical organization that engages in activities calculated to 
professionally ostracize any member who voluntarily engages in any kind of a professional relationship with a chiropractor is in 
restraint of trade, and a general boycott against all doctors of chiropractic is indefensible. "
779,7," Dr. Charles Harry Epps, an orthopedic surgeon, testified that some chiropractic treatments are scientific. Dr. Epps is presently 
a member of the Judicial Council of the AMA and he testified for the AMA. "
782,8," The material facts relating to the rejections testified to by the plaintiffs (and recited, for example, in the Plaintiffs' Summary of 
Proofs) are not in dispute and they will not be recited in this opinion. The disputed question is the source of or the basis for the 
rejection. "
783,9," Obviously, the boycott was not 100 % successful and there has always been some cooperation among medical physicians and 
chiropractors. "
784,10," The AMA also relies on the favorable results it received in other chiropractic litigation, but none of those results is binding here 
and there are substantial differences among the various lawsuits that render comparison useless. "
785,11," The appeal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons from the denial of its post-trial motion was decided in a 
separate order. The Court issued a similar finding against the Academy. "
797,12," Despite the existence of this resolution, ACR staff occasionally advised inquiring radiologists that it would be appropriate to 
make prior x-rays available to chiropractors at the request of patients. "
800,13," Therapeutic radiology, the treatment of cancer patients with radiation, is not involved in this suit. Diagnostic radiology is a 
consultative practice whereby radiologists, using various imaging techniques, attempt to detect pathology in the patient. "
801,14," Certainly not all x-rays requested by a chiropractor are useless. Chiropractors as well as medical physicians routinely take x-
rays for leg length measurements and back pain syndrome and such x-rays easily could be taken by a radiologist without risking 
harm to the patient."
801,15," THis kind of equipment generally is available only at hospitals. It is equipment that is not owned by radiologists, but access to 
the equipment is, as described above, in the control of the radiologists who are members of the hospital's medical staff. So a 
radiologist in that position at a hospital may, by declining to associate with chiropractors, deprive all patients of chiropractors 
access to that equipment. "
802,16," Even if ACR's present actions do not constitute a separate conspiracy continuing to the present time, those actions 
demonstrate ACR's willingness to renew its conspiratorial activity at any time. This heightens the necessity for an injunction 
against ACR. "
805,1," Reuben S. Sorensen and Anne-Marie Sorensen, both stockholder-directors of Key Financial Planning, are also 
plaintiffs/appellants. For ease of reference, we refer to the plaintiffs collectively as ""Key."" "
806,2," Weidaman had been hired upon Nelken's recommendation and was made an officer and board member of Key. Sorensen 
admitted that he knew he was not entitled to advances on policies sold to employees. Deposition of Reuben S. Sorensen, R. 
Vol. IV at 163-65. He apparently instructed Weidaman to misrepresent her employment status. Deposition of Weidaman, R. Vol. 
IX at 164-65. "
809,3," A horizontal conspiracy occurs when competitors at the same market level agree to restrain trade, whether at their own or 
another market level. Vertical restraints result when persons or firms at different market levels in the chain of distribution of a 
specific product conspire to restrain trade."
809,4," Other courts have refused to follow Klor's, absent price-fixing objectives or concerted activity among horizontal competitors. 
See, e.g., Products Liab. Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Crum & Forster Ins. Cos., 682 F.2d 660, 663 (7th Cir. 1982); A. H. Cox & Co. v. 
Star Mach. Co., 653 F.2d 1302, 1305 (9th Cir. 1981); Oreck Corp. v. Whirlpool Corp., 579 F.2d 126, 131-32 (2d Cir.) (en banc), 
cert. denied, 439 U.S. 946, 58 L. Ed. 2d 338, 99 S. Ct. 340 (1978)."
809,5," Key also argues that this case is similar to the conspiracy in Com-Tel, Inc. v. DuKane Corp., 669 F.2d 404 (6th Cir. 1982). In 
Com-Tel, however, ""the ultimate effect of the successful coercion was a horizontal combination of [three separate DuKane 
distributors], all refusing to sell to Com-Tel because of their concerted actions."" Id. at 413. In contrast, the alleged conspiracy 
here does not include two or more competitors at any one horizontal market level. "
810,6," The district court held that ""Key must demonstrate . . . that its contract with ITT was terminated as a result of a conspiracy that 
includes at least two competitors on the plaintiffs' horizontal distributional level."" R. Vol. I at 147. The conspiracy among 
horizontal competitors need not occur at the plaintiff's market level."
810,7," Hiring of a rival's employees does not make an arrangement per se illegal under section one. See Mid-West Underground 
Storage, Inc. v. Porter, 717 F.2d 493, 496-97 (10th Cir. 1983) (""'The difficulty with [the per se] approach is that the alleged 
conspiracy tends to be a spurious one, often between the defendant and parts of his own enterprise. Given, moreover, that the 
hiring of a rival's employees is not ordinarily exclusionary, even when done by a monopolist, characterizing the employment as a 
conspiracy seems little more than a semantic trick that is inconsistent with employee mobility.'"" Id. at 496 (quoting 3 P. Areeda & 
D. Turner, Antitrust Law § 828b, at 323 (1978)). "
811,8," Key argues that Diversified was paid a higher commission than Key and that each general agent was free to determine what 
portion of its total commission would be shared with its agents. Regardless of differences in the amount of the commissions 
received from ITT by Diversified and Key and the proportions in which they were distributed to agents, the price charged to 
ultimate consumers was the same. "
812,9," Dismissal of all the federal claims prior to trial, as here, may not always require the dismissal of the pendent state claims in all 
cases. See, e.g., Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U.S. 397, 404-05, 25 L. Ed. 2d 442, 90 S. Ct. 1207 (1970); Graf v. Elgin, Joliet & E. 
Ry., 790 F.2d 1341, 1347-48 (7th Cir. 1986); Province v. Cleveland Press Pub. Co., 787 F.2d 1047, 1054-55 (6th Cir. 1986). "
815,1," This doctrine may sometimes provide immunity for allegedly anticompetitive activity which is designed to influence public 
officials.  Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 
(1961); United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965). "
816,2," This case was decided prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981, and is binding precedent under Bonner v. City of 
Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981)."
816,3," Cable Holdings argues that these cases establish two distinct legal standards for evaluating the issue of preparedness. It 
contends that when the issue is one of prevention of entry into a new business, the antitrust plaintiff must in the first instance 
demonstrate preparation to enter. On the other hand, it contends, if the case involves the natural expansion of an existing 
business, the plaintiff need not demonstrate actual evidence of preparedness. The cases do not support this distinction. As 
noted in Heatransfer, ""even though an antitrust plaintiff operates a going concern, he must demonstrate his preparedness and 
intent to expand that business into a new market if he claims that the expansion of that business into a new market has been 
foreclosed to him by the monopolistic activities of the defendant."" 553 F.2d at 988 n. 20. Contrary to Cable Holdings' argument, the distinction actually drawn in Heatransfer is between expansion of an ongoing 
business into a new market -- which does require a showing of preparedness -- and the mere ""growth in an ongoing business."" 
In Heatransfer, a plaintiff who had demonstrated itself to be a going concern with capacity to manufacture and market air 
conditioning units for the entire family of Volkswagen automobiles was entitled -- without a further showing of preparedness -- to 
prove damages with respect to such units for Volkswagen models that it had already produced and also was entitled to prove 
damages with respect to ""other model"" units which it had not yet actually manufactured, but which were within its existing 
capacity to manufacture. In the instant case, Cable Holdings' attempt to enter the new geographic market, i.e., the western 
territory, was clearly an expansion of an ongoing business into a new market which does require a showing of preparedness. "
817,4," Cable Holdings contends that the Cobb County Board of Commissioners' decision to grant them a franchise in the western 
territory conclusively proves that they were prepared to expand their business. We disagree. Permission to enter a business may 
well precede by many months or even years a business company's ability, financially and technically, to implement the franchise."
817,5," Nor do we credit Cable Holdings' complaint that numerous other errors in the charge somehow infected the jury's finding on 
preparation. Our review of the charge convinces us that few, if any, errors were made by the trial court. Certainly, there were no 
errors which tainted the jury's finding on preparation."
817,6," Although the jury's product market determination was in the context of the Sherman Act claims, the district court's reliance on 
that jury finding in the Clayton Act context was not error. Cf.  Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 325, 82 S. Ct. 
1502, 1523, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1962) (applying Sherman Act product market standard to Clayton Act claims). Cable Holdings also asserts that other errors tainted the jury's product market finding. We have carefully examined these 
contentions and find them to be without merit."
817,7," Cable Holdings also argues that the district court improperly permitted the defendants to introduce evidence of Cable Holdings' 
unclean hands. Our examination of the record convinces us that this evidence was relevant to an assessment of the motivation 
defendants had in initiating the state lawsuit and that it was introduced solely as rebuttal to plaintiff's allegations. We find no 
error. "
829,1," Throughout this Order and Memorandum the Court will reference the record by citing deposition transcripts and other 
documents used by the parties in discovery. Documents produced by the parties have been paginated in accordance with a 
designation identifying the party or individual providing the document. "
831,2," Prior to the 1979 Amendment the Steuer Agreement had been amended at least once, in December 1970, to reduce the rate of 
compensation from 40% to 30% of gross billings."
831,3," Paragraph 11 of the 1979 Amendment further stated: ""The Pathologist has entered into the contractual relationship with [CMH] 
to provide professional services and this does not imply that he is an employee of [CMH] or Cherokee County."""
831,4," The Steuer/Latham Agreement was further amended in May 1983 to change the compensation formula as follows: the 
pathologists would receive 80% of gross monthly Anatomical Pathology charges, and 16% of adjusted gross monthly Clinical 
Lab Charges, (TM-113). In July 1983 the Steuer/Latham Agreement was further modified to reduce compensation to 13.5% of 
adjusted gross monthly clinical lab charges. (TM-114.) "
837,5," In Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986), a libel case, the Court held that a 
non-movant cannot sustain its burden if the evidence is merely colorable or is not sufficiently probative. Id. at 2511. Rather, the 
""trial judge must bear in mind the actual quantum and quality of proof"" necessary for the plaintiff to succeed at trial. Id. at 2513. 
In short, ""Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment . . . against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to 
establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.""

837,6," Although courts have been reluctant in the past to award summary judgment in antitrust cases, see Poller v. Columbia 
Broadcasting System, 368 U.S. 464, 7 L. Ed. 2d 458, 82 S. Ct. 486 (1962), the recent trend, even before Matsushita, has been 
that summary judgment is an important tool for dealing with antitrust cases. See, e.g., First National Bank v. Cities Service Co., 
391 U.S. 253, 290, 20 L. Ed. 2d 569, 88 S. Ct. 1575 (1968); Ottensmeyer v. Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Company of

(summary judgment granted in favor of defendant on Sherman § 1 claim). "
838,7," Plaintiffs take the position that their contractual relationship with CMH was not exclusive. While the word ""exclusive"" did not 
appear in plaintiffs' contracts with CMH, those contracts unquestionably made plaintiffs responsible for fulfilling all of the 
hospital's professional pathology requirements. Plaintiffs' argument to the contrary is frivolous. "
839,8," Mr. Barrett, manager of CMH's pathology laboratory, explained that the hospital had formerly used a single tier pricing structure 
that applied to both inpatient and outpatient pathology services. After the arrival of Dr. Mijanovich and Mr. Barrett, the hospital 
established a separate outpatient price structure in order to compete more effectively with reference labs. Outpatient prices were 
therefore lowered and prices for inpatient pathology services were adjusted upward, but only to levels that were competitive with 
the other hosptials with which CMH competes in providing inpatient services. The overall effect was a better gross margin and we were not overpriced according to inpatient pricing with our surrounding 
admitting hospitals. We now offered much lower out-patient pricing -- on a separate pricing schedule that they never had 
before. Barrett Dep. Tr. at 110-111. "
840,9," Valley Liquors, Inc. v. Renfield Importers, Ltd., 678 F.2d 742, 745 (7th Cir. 1982) (""A firm that has no market power is unlikely 
to adopt practices that disserve its consumers; it cannot afford to do so.""); see R.D. Imports Ryno Industries, Inc. v. Mazda 
Distributors (Gulf), Inc., 807 F.2d 1222 at 1225 (5th Cir. 1987) (""Without market power, a competitor can do nothing to diminish 
competition""), citing Northwest Power Products, Inc.  v. Omark Industries, Inc., 576 F.2d 83 (5th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 439 
U.S. 1116, 59 L. Ed. 2d 75, 99 S. Ct. 1021 (1979). "
841,10," The Court also notes that in Hyde the Supreme Court did not apply the per se test in a factual setting analogous to the instant 
case, and that the Court there appears to have ""substantially 'softened'"" its position regarding strict application of the per se test.  
Collins v. Associated Pathologists, Ltd., 1987-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) para. 67,603 at 60,618. The Court notes further that the "
842,," Fourth Circuit recently did not apply a per se analysis in Rockingham, which also involved a fact pattern quite similar to that 
presented here."
842,11," Even assuming it were appropriate to make such a distinction, this would not change the Court's decision here because there 
is no evidence to support a finding that purchasers of inpatient hospital services viewed professional anatomical or clinical 
pathology services as being separate from the provision of inpatient hospital services. Moreover, to the extent that distinguishing 
between professional anatomical and clinical pathology is appropriate, the Court notes that plaintiffs have apparently abandoned 
their claims regarding clinical pathology. At this juncture plaintiffs appear to persist only in their arguments regarding anatomical 
pathology."
842,12," Although there was a factual dispute in Collins regarding whether the agreements between the pathology group and the 
hospital were, in fact, exclusive, the Court found that dispute not to be material to its decision.  Rather, the Court concluded that 
the agreements at issue were not an unreasonable restraint of trade even if they did operate as exclusive contracts. Collins, 
supra at 60,612. "
843,13," The Collins Court distinguished Hyde, wherein the Supreme Court, in rejecting an antitrust challenge to an exclusive contract 
between a hospital and an anesthesia provider, had nonetheless found that anesthesia services were a separate product from 
hospital services. The Hyde Court's analysis relied heavily on the fact that ""patients or surgeons often request specific 
anesthesiologists to come to a hospital to provide anesthesia, and that the choice of an individual anesthesiologist separate from 
the choice of a hospital is particularly frequent in respondent's specialty, obstetric anesthesiology."" Hyde, supra, 466 U.S. at 22 
(footnote omitted). The record here, in contrast, contains no evidence that patients or their doctors request a specific pathologist. 
Moreover, the Hyde Court specifically recognized that anesthesiologists differ in material respects from ""radiologists, 
pathologists and other types of hospital-based physicians."" Id. at 23 n.36. Thus, while this Court wholly adopts the framework of "
844,," product market analysis espoused by Hyde, the product-specific conclusion in Hyde that anesthesia services are a separate 
product from hospital services is of no probative value in determining whether pathology services are a separate product market 
from hospital services."
844,14," Patients' physicians choose what procedures a patient needs.  Mijanovich Dep. Tr. at 146. This fact is conceded by plaintiffs.  
Plaintiffs' Mem. at 3. Moreover, plaintiffs do not contend that physicians or their patients are forced to purchase medically 
unnecessary or inappropriate pathology consults. "
845,15," The Rockingham court distinguished Hyde, ""where the hospital and the anesthesiologists shared the fees for anesthesiological 
services."" 820 F.2d at 104, citing Hyde, 466 U.S. at 6 n.4, where the Hyde Court noted that ""the fees for anesthesiological 
services are billed separately to the patients by the hospital. They cover the hospital's costs and the professional services 
provided by [the exclusive anesthesia contractor].  After a deduction of eight percent to provide a reserve for uncollectible 
accounts, the fees are divided equally between [the exclusive anesthesia contractor] and the hospital."" The situation described in 
Hyde is virtually identical to the billing and revenue arrangements which existed between CMH and plaintiffs with respect to 
anatomical consults prior to July 1, 1983, when the Department of Health and Human Services promulgated a regulation 
requiring pathologists to bill patients directly for primary anatomical consults. Steuer Dep. Tr. at 197. This regulation resulted in 
an Addendum and Amendment to the Steuer/Latham Agreement which provided, that with respect to Anatomical Pathology 
Charges ""the Pathologist shall bill the patient directly for professional services in the name of the pathologist. . . . The Hospital 
shall bill to the patient for technical services provided by the Hospital."" July 1, 1983 Addendum and Agreement [to 
Steuer/Latham Agreement], TM-114. Dr. Steuer's testimony regarding the origin of separate billing for professional services is 
also useful in considering plaintiffs' remarkable (and entirely unsupported) contention that ""splitting the bill into two components 
is merely an attempt to violate the antitrust laws in an indirect, rather than direct, manner.  Plaintiffs' Mem. at 11-12. This policy 
was adopted by the hospital and agreed to by plaintiffs in mid-1983 -- well before defendants assumed control of CMH."
845,16," A relevant antitrust market has also been defined as ""a product or group of products and a geographical area in which it is sold 
such that a hypothetical, profit-maximizing firm . . . that was the only present and future seller of those products in that area 
""could profitably raise prices above competitive levels for a significant period of time."" Department of Justice 1984 Merger 
Guidelines, 49 Fed. Reg. 26,824-826 (1984). "
846,17," See Department of Justice 1984 Merger Guidelines, 49 Fed. Reg. 26,824 (1984)."
846,18," Plaintiffs offered no indication of the precise contours of this radius. It is clear, however, that the area included within the 20-
mile radius of CMH extends well beyond the boundaries of Cherokee County, reaching into both North Carolina and 
Spartanburg."
846,19," ""The Plaintiff's personal preference to continue his practice at [a particular hospital] does not justify excluding another area 
hospital from the 'relevant' geographical market.'"" Kuck v. Bensen, 647 F. Supp. 743, 746 (D. Me. 1986) (upholding exclusive 
contract between hospital and emergency room physician)."
846,20," E.g., Consul, Ltd. v. Transco Energy Co., 805 F.2d 490 (4th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1050, 107 S. Ct. 2182, 95 L. 
Ed. 2d 838 (1987). "
847,21," The Fourth Circuit has used similar language in describing geographic market definition: ""The geographic market should consist of an area in which the defendants operate and which the plaintiff can reasonably 
turn to for supplies."" . . . The penultimate question, towards which this preliminary inquiry into market definition is directed, 
is whether the defendant has market power: the ability to raise prices above levels that would exist in a perfectly 
competitive market. The geographic market demarcation should not be too tightly drawn, unless clear evidence exists that 
potential competitors outside the region are hindered from entering. A market drawn too tightly, either in geographic terms 
that exclude potential suppliers or in product terms that exclude potential substitutes, creates the illusion of market power 
where none may exist."" Consul, Ltd. v. Transco Energy Co., 805 F.2d 490, 495 (4th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1050, 107 S. Ct. 2182, 95 L. Ed.

847,22," See, e.g., Syufy Enterprises v. American Multicinema, Inc., 793 F.2d 990, 995 (9th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1031, 
107 S. Ct. 876, 93 L. Ed. 2d 830 (1977) (""neither the Supreme Court nor any other court has ever decided whether a market

475 U.S. 1129, 106 S. Ct. 1659, 90 L. Ed. 2d 201 (1986) (the focus in determining market power should be on barriers to entry 
as well as on market share); Cowley v. Braden Indus., Inc., 613 F.2d 751, 753-55 (9th Cir.) cert. denied, 446 U.S. 965, 100 S. 
Ct. 2942, 64 L. Ed. 2d 824 (1980) (no evidence of harm to competition despite 70% market share); Landes & Posner, Market 
Power in Antitrust Cases, 94 Harv. L. Rev. 937, 950-51 (1981) (even an 80% market share can be too little to establish market 
power if, for example, there are insignificant barriers to entry). Plaintiffs seek to circumvent their failure to adduce record evidence of barriers to entry by arguing that there are 
""significant"" barriers to entering the acute care hospital market in Gaffney. Plaintiffs' Mem. at 36-37. The ""barriers"" 
inaccurately identified by plaintiffs relate solely to constructing a hospital in Cherokee County, not to the ability of hospitals 
outside the County to offer services to county residents. Plaintiffs' inexplicably ignore the fact that in order to sell hospital 
services to county residents it is not necessary for a hospital to be located in the County. This is evidenced by the fact that 
hospitals outside the County presently sell their services to over 40% of the residents of the County. Plaintiffs are, in any 
event, wrong in claiming that one of the barriers to entry is ""that in order for a new hospital to enter the Cherokee County 
market it must first obtain a certificate of need from the County itself."" Plaintiffs' Mem. at 37. In fact, the state, not the 
County, awards certificates of need, and these certificates are necessary only to construct a facility, not to offer services to "
848,," residents of a county different from that in which the hospital is located. Department of Health and Environmental Control, 
Regulation 61-15. Thus, for example, Spartanburg hospitals do not require certificates of need to offer their services to 
Cherokee County residents. Plaintiffs also claim that there are ""significant economic barriers to entry in the market."" 
Plaintiffs' Mem. at 37. This conclusory assertion is made without reference to the record, and, in fact, there is no record 
evidence to support it."
848,23," Defendants' expert testimony was tendered to the Court in an Affidavit by Dr. Barry Harris which accompanied their 
memorandum in support of summary judgment. Dr. Harris is an industrial organization economist who has testified frequently in 
hospital and other antitrust cases. Plaintiffs have not challenged Dr. Harris' qualifications."
848,24," Hyde, supra. 466 U.S. at 25 n.40."
848,25," Plaintiffs have declined to offer expert testimony on market definition issues. Plaintiffs apparently believe that expert testimony 
is not necessary to address these issues despite the fact that when Dr. Steuer was asked his understanding of the tying and tied 
products alleged in paragraph 38 of his Complaint, he responded: ""Well, I'm glad you asked that, because I don't understand it at 
all."" Steuer Dep. Tr. at 712.  Failure to adduce expert testimony on competitive issues such as market definition augurs strongly 
in favor of granting summary judgment against an antitrust plaintiff. See, e.g., Military Services Realty Inc. v. Realty Consultants 
of Virginia, 823 F.2d 829 (4th Cir. 1987, C.A.4); Forro Precision, Inc. v. IBM, 673 F.2d 1045, 1058-1059 (9th Cir. 1982) (rejecting 
plaintiff's claim that defendant possessed market power because, in part, plaintiff failed to produce expert testimony to interpret 
market share information; ""without the benefit of expert testimony or other credible evidence to support an inference of market 
power from the list of companies and market share, any such inference [of market power] would be sheer speculation."")"
848,26," It should be noted that these driving times (based on the most direct route at speeds at or below the posted speed limits) 
represent the maximum distance a patient from Cherokee County would need to travel to use a hospital other than Cherokee 
Memorial. Thus, a patient residing mid-way between Cherokee Memorial and the hospitals in Spartanburg, for example, would 
not have to drive any additional distance from his residence to use a hospital other than Cherokee Memorial. "
849,27," The courts have routinely rejected single facility markets in numerous other industries. E.g., R.D. Imports Ryno Industries, Inc. 
v. Mazda Distributors (Gulf), Inc., 807 F.2d 1222 (5th Cir. 1987) (rejecting product market consisting only of two Mazda model-
lines, and adopting product market which includes all foreign and domestic automobiles which competed with Mazda products). "
850,," See also United States v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 100 L. Ed. 1264, 76 S. Ct. 994 (1956) (holding that a 
manufacturer's monopoly over the distribution of its own product is not illegal); and Domed Stadium Hotel, Inc. v. Holiday Inns, 
Inc., 732 F.2d 480 (5th Cir. 1984) (rejecting the contention that Holiday Inn hotel rooms, as opposed to hotel rooms generally, in 
downtown New Orleans constitute an antitrust market). As the Fifth Circuit stated recently: ""while the question of relevant market 
is usually one of fact for the jury, the relevant market may in some instances be determined as a matter of law. . . . One 
purchaser in a market of competing purchasers cannot constitute a relevant geographic market, absent exceptional market 
conditions."" Jayco Systems, Inc. v. Savin Business Machines Corp., 777 F.2d 306, 319 n.43 (5th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 479 
U.S. 816, 107 S. Ct. 73, 93 L. Ed. 2d 30 (1986)."
850,28," At oral argument plaintiffs' counsel claimed that they had attacked the Mijanovich Contract only on tying grounds, and insisted 
they had not claimed that it constituted an impermissible exclusive dealing arrangement.  Counsel's suggestion reflects a 
misreading of Count I of the Complaint and the Amended Complaint, both of which claimed that defendants and unnamed others 
had combined and conspired ""to unreasonably prevent and restrain competition in the furnishing of additional hospital services 
and professional pathology services to the public and the Plaintiffs will be prevented from practicing their profession and 
competing in the providing of professional pathology services."" Moreover, in responding to defendants' arguments in their 
memoranda that the Mijanovich Contract did not constitute an illegal exclusive dealing arrangement, plaintiffs never indicated 
that defendants had wrongly construed Count I of the Complaint or Amended Complaint. "
851,29," This is consistent with Hyde, where the Court stated that a rule of reason analysis of an exclusive contract between a hospital 
and an anesthesiologist ""involves an inquiry into the actual effect of the exclusive contract on competition among 
anesthesiologists."" Hyde, supra, 466 U.S. at 30. "
852,30," In Ross v. Communications Satellite Corp., 759 F.2d 355, 365 (4th Cir. 1985), the Fourth Circuit emphasized that unsupported 
allegations and conclusions ""do not confer talismanic immunity from Rule 56."" Conclusory assertions of conspiratorial conduct 
simply are not sufficient to avoid summary judgment. Ottensmeyer v. Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co., 756 F.2d 986, 
992 (4th Cir. 1985). Likewise, a conspiracy cannot be inferred from conduct that is as consistent with independent action as with 
a conspiracy. See The Garment District, Inc. v. Belk Stores Services, Inc., 799 F.2d 905, 911 (4th Cir. 1986). Finally, the Fourth 
Circuit had always recognized that ""the non-moving party, however, cannot create a genuine issue of material fact through mere 
speculation or the building of one inference upon another."" Beale v. Hardy, 769 F.2d 213, 214 (4th Cir. 1985)."
852,31," Since defendants are under common ownership they must be treated as a single entity for antitrust purposes.  Copperweld 
Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984)."
852,32," Mr. Tidikis, defendants' Regional Vice President, testified that based on various existing deficiencies, licensure and inspection 
problems and continuing ""service level problems,"" it was his perception that a great deal of improvement was necessary in the 
CMH Pathology Department. Tidikis Dep. Tr. at 23, 109. Among these problems were deficiencies in the laboratory, id. at 23, 
turn-around time and reliability of results, id. at 26, and problems with supervision of the laboratory by the pathologist, id.  at 27. 
Mr. Tidikis also testified as to the advantages of exclusivity from the perspective of hospital administration: e.g., it establishes 
one point of contact with responsibility for the medical direction of a department affixed with one individual or group, and also 
facilitates risk management. Id.  at 56-57. Defendants offered plaintiffs a contract which, if accepted by plaintiffs, would have 
facilitated the correction of the problems in the Pathology Department, particularly in relation to ""the defining of responsibilities of 
and supervision and who was going to do what in the laboratory."" Id. at 109. Plaintiffs rejected that contract and defendants 
entered into a contract with Dr. Mijanovich, who was willing to provide the pathology services required by CMH at a cost to the 
hospital substantially below both the amount previously paid to plaintiffs and the figure proposed by plaintiffs during the 
negotiations which preceded their non-renewal. "
853,33," Cf.  Cooper v. Forsyth County Hospital Authority, Inc., 789 F.2d 278, 282 (4th Cir.) cert. denied, 479 U.S. 972, 107 S. Ct. 474, 
93 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1986). "
855,34," Plaintiffs belatedly attempted to avoid this conclusion by suggesting for the first time in their Opposition to Defendants' Motion 
for Summary Judgment that they do compete with the hospital for the provision of the technical component of anatomical 
surgical consults. To the extent that this claim has any validity, it can relate only to competition for providing the technical 
component of anatomical surgical consults for pathology specimens generated from locations other than CMH. Such competition 
occurs in the market in which the CMH pathology laboratory competes primarily with reference labs located throughout the 
southeast.  The only evidence in the record regarding this reference lab market confirms that it is characterized by vigorous 
competition and is not susceptible to monopolization by CMH. "
856,35," It is well established that there is no private right of action under the Federal Trade Commission Act.  Holloway v. Bristol-
Myers, 158 U.S.  App. D.C. 207, 485 F.2d 986 (D.C. Cir. 1973); see also, Carlson v. Coca Cola Co., 483 F.2d 279, 280 (9th Cir. 
1973). In addition, District Courts in the Fourth Circuit have adopted this view. See Summey v. Ford Motor Credit Co., 449 F. 
Supp. 132 (D.S.C. 1976), aff'd mem, 573 F.2d 1306 (4th Cir. 1978) (""it is well settled that there is no private, federal claim for 
which this court can grant relief for violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act."" Id. at 135); L&H Investment, Ltd. v. Belvey 
Corp., 444 F. Supp. 1321 (W.D.N.C. 1978); United Roasters, Inc. v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., 485 F. Supp. 1049 (E.D.N.C. 1980) 
(""there is no private right of action under the Federal Trade Commission Act,"" Id. at 1059 n.7). Accordingly, defendants are 
plainly entitled to judgment as a matter of law on plaintiffs' unfounded claim under 15 U.S.C. § 45. "
857,36," Action under color of state law is analyzed under the same standards required to demonstrate state action under the 
Fourteenth Amendment.  United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787, 794 n.7, 16 L. Ed. 2d 267, 86 S. Ct. 1152 (1966); see also 
Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.S. 830, 838, 73 L. Ed. 2d 418, 102 S. Ct. 2764 (1982)."
857,37," See Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.S. 830, 73 L. Ed. 2d 418, 102 S. Ct. 2764 (1982) (no state action where private school 
supported by public funding discharges teachers); Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 73 L. Ed. 2d 534, 102 S. Ct. 2777 (1982) (no 
state action by nursing home operators who decide whether Medicaid patients should be transferred or discharged); Lugar v. 
Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 73 L. Ed. 2d 482, 102 S. Ct. 2744 (1982) (state action present where sheriff executes writ of 
attachment at behest of private party and in accordance with statute); Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345, 42 L. 
Ed. 2d 477, 95 S. Ct. 449 (1974) (no state action where monopoly utility, heavily regulated by state, terminates service); Moose 
Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U.S. 163, 32 L. Ed. 2d 627, 92 S. Ct. 1965 (1972) (no state action in private party's racial 
discrimination by virtue of state regulation of liquor licenses); Burton, 365 U.S. 715, 6 L. Ed. 2d 45, 81 S. Ct. 856 (1961) (state 
action present where state leases space in parking structure to restaurant which practices racial discrimination, and state profits 
from arrangement)."
857,38," Two later Court cases reach conclusions consistent with Modaber.  In Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 73 L. Ed. 2d 534, 102 
S. Ct. 2777 (1982), the Court considered to what extent state officials, as defendants, could be held responsible for acts of 
private individuals who decided to transfer or discharge Medicaid patients. While recognizing this case is ""obviously different 
from those cases in which the defendant is a private party and the question is whether his conduct has sufficiently received the 
imprimatur of the state so as to make it 'state action,'"" id. at 1003, the Court adopted tests from its earlier cases in deciding no 
state action was present.  Id.  at 1004-12. In Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.S. 830, 73 L. Ed. 2d 418, 102 S. Ct. 2764 (1982), the 
Court applied the rationale developed in Blum and its earlier decisions to find no state action in the discharge of teachers from a 
private school which received substantial public funding. "
858,," In Carter v. Norfolk Community Hospital Association, 761 F.2d 970 (4th Cir. 1985), the Fourth Circuit, citing its earlier decision in 
Modaber and the Supreme Court's Blum decision, held there was no state action in the revocation of a doctor's hospital 
privileges by the hospital, allegedly at the behest of a private organization which reviewed Medicare and Medicaid abuse. "
859,39," The Fourth Circuit had held in a line of cases that acceptance of Hill-Burton Act grant funds was sufficient to establish state 
action on the part of recipient hospitals.  Modaber, 674 F.2d at 1025. Modaber, however, specifically overruled the earlier cases, 
id. at 1026, in light of Jackson. "
861,40," Collins also contains language indicating that a physician's rights as a contract physician have nothing to do with his rights as 
a member of the medical staff. See discussion at n.43 herein."
861,41," The action for tortious interference with contractual relations has never been expanded by the South Carolina courts to 
encompass prospective contractual relations.  Smith v. Holt, Rinehart & Winston, Inc., 270 S.C. 446, 242 S.E.2d 548 (1978); 
Columbia Management Corp. v. Resort Properties, 279 S.C. 370, 307 S.E.2d 228 (1983); Todd v. South Carolina Farm Bureau 
Mutual Insurance Company, 283 S.C. 155, 321 S.E.2d 602 (1984), reversed on other grounds, 287 S.C. 190, 336 S.E.2d 472 
(1985). In fact, South Carolina has explicitly rejected the invitation to recognize such a cause of action: We think that the limitation on a cause of action for intentional interference to instances where there is a valid contract in 
existence is justified by the fact that the parties have a property right in an existing contract . . . [but] the law affords no 
protection to rights which are not yet in existence. Smith, supra, 242 S.E.2d at 549. The same court also expressed its view that if an action for tortious interference with 
prospective contractual relations was to become the law in South Carolina, it should be by legislative enactment. Id. Accordingly, 
plaintiffs' claim of tortious interference with prospective economic advantage may not be maintained under South Carolina law. "
862,42," A similar claim under Illinois law was considered and rejected by the Collins court. There, the plaintiff pathologist claimed that 
the defendants had tortiously interfered with his medical staff privileges.  After finding that the plaintiff's staff privileges had not, in 
fact, been reduced, because the exclusive pathology contract at issue was valid under federal and state antitrust laws, the court 
granted summary judgment for defendants on the tortious interference claim. Specifically, Collins noted: Because the Court has found that the agreement was legal and did not violate antitrust laws, the Plaintiff cannot argue that 
the parties to the agreement committed a tort by adhering to the terms of that agreement. The Court finds that even if the 
Defendants had caused [the hospital] to comply with the agreement by not hiring [the plaintiff pathologist], such action was 
taken pursuant to a lawful agreement and cannot form the basis for [plaintiff's] claim that [the defendants] interfered with 
[plaintiff's] staff privilege because he was refused future employment at the Hospital. Collins, Slip Op. at A-52."
862,43," Collins provides further support for this Court's conclusion that plaintiffs have not been deprived of their medical staff privileges 
as a result of defendants' decision not to renew their pathology contract. The plaintiff in Collins likewise alleged that the 
defendant hospital ""did not comply with the bylaws of the hospital when they substantially removed or reduced [plaintiffs'] staff 
privileges in pathology by preventing him from practicing pathology in the pathology laboratory."" (Slip Op. at A-49).  In accepting 
the hospital's argument that ""[plaintiff] was not entitled to any type of procedure regarding his staff privileges, because the 
Hospital never removed or reduced the Plaintiff's staff privileges"", id., the Collins Court noted: A hospital requires that a physician have staff privileges at its facility as a means of insuring that a doctor is qualified to 
practice in his profession and that the hospital will fulfill its public service function of delivering quality medical services to its 
patients. [Plaintiff] was not entitled to be employed by the Hospital simply because the Hospital had granted him staff 
privileges, even if the Hospital would not have employed him had he not had staff privileges. A hospital's decision to grant 
or deny staff privileges is based upon the qualifications of the physician, and a hospital is not required to employ everyone 
to whom it has granted staff privileges. In the present case, [plaintiff] is asserting that because St. John's Hospital had granted him staff privileges, he was entitled 
to practice pathology in the Hospital's pathology laboratory, using the Hospital's laboratory equipment. However, St. John's 
Hospital declined to hire [plaintiff] because they already had a contractual arrangement with APL for the provision of all of 
their pathology services. The Hospital never made an issue out of Dr. Collins' qualifications to practice pathology, which 
would have been the real issue at a hearing involving the reduction or removal of his staff privileges. Dr. Collins maintains 
his staff privileges at St. John's Hospital at the current time under a leave of absence status; because the Hospital never "
863,," reduced or removed his staff privileges, there was no issue or dispute about his qualifications which a hearing and other 
procedures in the by-laws could have addressed. It is true that [plaintiff] has been refused employment by St. John's 
Hospital, but this is due to the contract between the Hospital and APL and cannot be characterized as a reduction or 
removal of staff privileges which would require the procedural protections written into the Hospital's by-laws. The Court 
orders summary judgment in favor of the Defendants on Count IX. Collins, slip op. at A-50. "
870,1," After commencement of the action, but before decision in the district court, defendants Wheeling-Pittsburgh and LTV Steel 
Company, formerly known as Republic Steel Corporation and successor to defendant Jones & Laughlin Steel, Incorporated, filed 
Petitions in Bankruptcy. This action was dismissed as against Wheeling-Pittsburgh on August 5, 1985 and stayed pursuant to 
Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code as against LTV Steel. On or about April 29, 1985, defendant Consolidation Coal 
Company commenced an action against its affiliate, defendant Harmar Coal Company in the Court of Common Pleas of 
Allegheny County, Pennsylvania for the appointment of a receiver. On or about May 3, 1985 a receiver was duly appointed. This 
action has been stayed by consent of Pocahontas as against Harmar. "
872,2," Though the ""deputization"" theory has been advanced by the Justice Department in specific litigation, see United States v. 
Cleveland Trust, 392 F. Supp. 699 (N.D. Ohio 1974), aff'd mem., 513 F.2d 633 (6th Cir. 1975), it has not been adopted by any 
court, see United Auto Workers, 97 F.T.C. Op. 933, 935 (1981). "
887,1," The moving defendants are: Merrill Lynch, ACLI International Commodity Services, Inc. (""ACLI""), Nelson Bunker Hunt, William 
Herbert Hunt, Douglas Herbert Hunt, and Lamar Hunt (collectively, ""the Hunts""), Placid Oil Company (""Placid Oil""), International 
Metals Investment Co., Ltd. (""IMIC""), Prudential-Bache Securities, Inc. (formerly Bache Halsey Stuart Shields Incorporated) 
(""Prudential-Bache""), Board of Trade of the City of Chicago (""CBOT"") and Commodity Exchange, Inc. (""COMEX"") (collectively, 
""the exchanges""), John J. Conheeney, and Norton Waltuch.  Merrill Lynch, the exchanges, Conheeney, Waltuch, and a coalition 
of nine nonexchange defendants have each filed separate submissions. "
888,2," Although the text of the opinion failed in one place to include count XXXIV as one of the claims dismissed with prejudice, 
Michelson, 619 F. Supp. at 734, this omission was inadvertent. A footnote to the text and the opinion's final summary paragraph 
make clear that count XXXIV was dismissed with prejudice and without leave to replead.  Id. at 734 n.7 & 742."
888,3," To the extent that count III, which alleges that all defendants violated the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13 (1982), relates 
to allegations regarding Merrill Lynch's participation in the general conspiracy among the defendants to corner the silver market, 
it is dismissed for failure to state a claim for the reasons stated in part IV-A of the 1985 decision. See Michelson, 619 F. Supp. at 
738. The part of count IX which alleged in the original complaint that Merrill Lynch accelerated Michelson's payment on his account in 
bad faith in violation of New Mexico law, N.M.Stat.Ann. § 55-1-208 (1978), was dismissed for reasons of res judicata with 
prejudice and without leave to replead and is not pleaded in the amended complaint."
888,4," Merrill Lynch's argument that the United States Constitution bars the application of New Mexico law as to it is rejected, as 
explained below in part II-A."
888,5," Counts XIV and XV are considered to be alleged against Merrill Lynch alone, since the plaintiff is bound by his original pleading 
in this respect. "
889,6," N.M.Stat.Ann. § 30-42-4 (C) provides in pertinent part: HN3[
] It is unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise to conduct or participate, directly or 
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs by engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity. HN4[
] The statute defines ""enterprise"" to mean any sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, business, labor union, association or other legal entity or any group of 
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity, and includes illicit as well as licit entities, N.M.Stat.Ann. § 30-42-3 (C), and HN5[
] ""pattern of racketeering activity"" to mean engaging in at least two incidents of racketeering with the intent of accomplishing any of the prohibited activities set forth in 
. . . Section 30-42-4 . . . provided at least one of such incidents occurred after the effective date of the Racketeering Act and 
the last of which occurred within five years after the commission of a prior incident of racketeering, N.M.Stat.Ann. § 30-42-3 (D). "
890,7," Count XXXIII is considered to be alleged only against Merrill Lynch and the exchanges, notwithstanding plaintiff's amendment 
of the claim to allege a violation against all defendants, since he is bound by the original complaint in this respect."
890,8," A ""cross trade"" is understood to mean a noncompetitive trade made by matching the orders of two customers, either directly or 
through an intermediary, without offering them openly to all traders in the pit or ring. P. Johnson, Commodities Regulation § 3.94 
at 528 (vol. 1), § 5.38 at 309-10 (vol. 2) (1982). HN6[
] The term ""fictitious sale,"" although of uncertain meaning, seems to 
embrace situations in which a trade is reported that did not in fact take place. Id. See also Merrill Lynch Futures Inc., v. Kelly, 
585 F. Supp. 1245, 1251 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. 1984)."
890,9," In light of this finding, Merrill Lynch's arguments that count XXXIII should be dismissed (1) because there is no private right of 
action under CEA section 4c for causes of action accruing prior to 1983, see CEA § 22(d), 7 U.S.C. § 25(d), and (2) because 
Michelson has failed to state a claim under that section, are not considered. With regard to the latter point, however, it should be 
noted that given the highly technical nature of section 4c's prohibitions it would in this court's view be necessary to plead the 
specific trades and reports that are alleged to violate the statute in order to state a claim. Thus, even if count XXXIII could be 
read as charging Merrill Lynch with a section 4c violation unrelated to the January 10, 1980 transaction, it would not survive a 
motion to dismiss. "
891,10," Nine nonexchange defendants move jointly in various combinations to dismiss a number of the claims. They are: ACLI, the 
Hunts, Placid Oil, Merrill Lynch, IMIC, and Prudential-Bache. They are sometimes referred to in this section collectively as ""the 
nonexchange defendants"" or ""the defendants."""
891,11," As indicated above in note 5, the amended complaint is deemed to allege counts XIV and XV (New Mexico racketeering 
claims) against Merrill Lynch alone."
891,12," The 1985 decision dismissed only counts VII, IX, and XVI because these were the only claims for which dismissal was sought 
at the time. See Michelson, 619 F. Supp. at 738 & n.16. "
892,13," To the extent Michelson intended in counts XIV and XV, see supra text at note 5, to state a private right of action under New 
Mexico's criminal fraud, extortion, and attempt statutes (as opposed to stating a racketeering claim, which is how this court reads 
the complaint), this analysis also applies to bar those claims. "
893,14, See supra text at note 3.
893,15," 57-14-6. Customer Discrimination. HN12[
] It is unlawful for any person engaged in commerce: A. to pay or contract for payment of anything of value to or for the benefit of a customer as compensation for any services or 
facilities furnished by or through the customer in connection with the processing, handling, sale or offering for sale of any 
products or commodities manufactured, sold or offered for sale unless the payment or compensation is available on 
proportionally equal terms to all other customers competing in the distribution of the products or commodities; B. to discriminate in favor of one purchaser against another purchaser of a commodity bought for resale, with or without 
processing, by contracting to furnish or furnishing, or by contributing to the furnishing of any services or facilities connected with 
the processing, handling, sale or offering for sale of the commodity purchased on terms not accorded to all purchasers on 
proportionally equal terms; or C. knowingly to induce or receive a discrimination in price which is prohibited by [this Act]. "
894,16," In contrast to the Robinson-Patman Act, upon which count III is based, the New Mexico Price Discrimination Act contains a 
definition of ""commodity,"" which encompasses ""any commercial service sold in commerce,"" N.M.Stat.Ann. § 57-14-2 (D)."
894,17," Counts XXVII and XXXII, which also allege CEA § 4b violations, are considered to have been asserted against Merrill Lynch 
alone, consistent with the terms of the original complaint and notwithstanding their misleading categorization in the ""Prayer"" 
section of the amended complaint.  Both claims were dismissed with prejudice by the 1985 decision. See supra text at note 2. "
895,18, See supra text at note 3. 
896,19," The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit continues to apply the ""bad faith"" standard to claims that an exchange or its 
officials acted or failed to take action to the detriment of others in connection with the exchange's performance of its statutory 
duty to maintain a fair and orderly market. See Apex Oil Co. v. DiMauro, 822 F.2d 246, 261 (2d Cir. 1987), aff'g in part, rev'g in 
part 641 F. Supp. 1246 (S.D.N.Y. 1986); Brawer v. Options Clearing Corp., 807 F.2d 297, 302-303 (2d Cir. 1986); but see Apex, 
at 260 (not reaching issue of whether bad faith is necessary element of antitrust claim against exchange), commenting on 641 F. 
Supp. at 1282."
896,20," The exchanges' argument that it is inconceivable that Michelson could allege in good faith that the exchanges acted in bad 
faith in light of the contrary findings contained in the report of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (""CFTC"") Division of 
Trading and Markets, see CFTC, The Silver Market of 1979/1980 at 681 (November 1985), presents a question of fact which 
cannot be resolved on a motion to dismiss. The question of the weight to be given to the CFTC's evaluation of the exchanges' 
actions must await a more fully developed record.  Gordon v. Hunt, 558 F. Supp. at 124. "
898,21, See supra text at note 15 for the wording of the claim.
898,22," The exchanges' suggestion that the most suitable rule of limitation for an implied private right of action under the CEA is the 
two-year period already embodied in the federal regulatory scheme in CEA sections 22(c), 7 U.S.C. § 25(c) (express private 
right of action), and 14(a), 7 U.S.C. § 18(a) (administrative reparations proceedings), is rejected for the reasons explained in 
Fustok and Grosser. "
899,23," The exchanges contend that the more appropriate New York limitations period is N.Y.Civ.Prac.Law § 214(2) (McKinney 1972), 
which imposes a three-year rule of limitation on actions to recover upon a liability, penalty or forfeiture created or imposed by 
statute. They rely on this court's decision in Hornblower & Weeks-Hemphill, Noyes v. Burchfield, 366 F. Supp. 1364 (S.D.N.Y. 
1973), in which § 214(2) was held to apply to an investor's claim against his broker for violation of margin regulations issued by 
the Federal Reserve Board, on the reasoning that ""margin violations were of course unknown to the common law . . . and a 
cause of action would not exist but for the presence of a statute which provides a basis for it."" Id. at 1366. The gist of the 
argument appears to be that at least some of the CEA claims alleged by Michelson, such as those premised upon the 
exchanges' failure to fulfill their duty to maintain an orderly market, see, e.g., § 5a(8), 7 U.S.C. § 7a(8), also would not exist but 
for the presence of the statute. The reliance on Hornblower is misplaced. That decision was careful to note: In holding as we do, we recognize that in other circumstances claims of margin violations may constitute part of a § 10(b) 
claim under the Exchange Act, in which case the six year (fraud) limitations period . . .  appears to apply. In the case at hand, however, the counterclaims, stripped of allegations of fraud [the fraud counts having been dismissed 
for failure to state a claim], sound in tort; at most, they claim plaintiff was negligent in his handling of defendant's account. Id. at 1368 (citations omitted). The first paragraph above would apply precisely to those CEA claims which, although not 
containing fraud as an express ingredient, are bound up in the charge that the acts or omissions by the exchanges that violated 
the CEA were in bad faith and motivated by self-interest so as to amount to fraud. See supra text at notes 19-20.  Subsequent 
cases in this district have embraced the distinction made in Hornblower.  See Panayotopulas v. Chemical Bank, 464 F. Supp. 
199, 204 (S.D.N.Y. 1979) (approving Hornblower and applying six-year limitations period for fraud to claim for violation of similar 
regulation); Loengard v. Santa Fe Industries, Inc., 573 F. Supp. 1355, 1357-59 (S.D.N.Y. 1983) (applying six-year limitations 
period for fraud to Martin Act claim)."
899,24," The exchanges assert that Illinois is the state where the claim arose and that it is that state's three-year blue sky limitations 
period, which has been held to apply to CEA claims, see Grosser, 639 F. Supp. at 1300-01, that should be compared with the 
applicable New York statute of limitations under the borrowing statute. They reason that the place where the claim arose cannot 
be New Mexico, since the federal court in New Mexico held in this case that Michelson's claims did not arise in that state for 
purposes of determining personal jurisdiction, see supra cases cited in text in part III-A, and they cite an unpublished federal 
district court opinion which holds that for purposes of determining personal jurisdiction a claim arises where the exchange on 
which plaintiff traded is located, see Wise v. Commodity Exchange, Inc., NO. C82-352A, slip op. at 9 (N.D.Ga. Jan. 7, 1983), 
reprinted in Memorandum of Certain Defendants in Support of Their Motions To Dismiss at Exhibit O. The problem with this analysis is that it confuses the question of where a claim arises for the purpose of determining whether 
there exists personal jurisdiction -- a determination which is concerned only with a defendant's contacts with the forum -- with the 
question of where a cause of action accrues for New York borrowing statute purposes -- a determination which is concerned 
only with the plaintiff's activities. It is true that the Grosser decision considered the statutes of limitations of both the place where plaintiff resided and the place 
where plaintiff's futures contract was liquidated in performing the borrowing statute comparison.  Grosser, 639 F. Supp. at 1300-
03. However, neither party in Grosser argued that one rather than the other jurisdiction was more appropriate, and the survival of "
900,," the CEA claims did not depend on the difference between the applicable limitations periods in the two states.  Moreover, the 
better approach to the place of injury question in a case like this appears to be to ask ""who became poorer, and where did they 
become poorer"" as a result of the conduct complained of. See Appel v. Kidder, Peabody & Co., 628 F. Supp. 153, 156 (S.D.N.Y. 
1986) (Weinfeld, J.) (finding locus of harm to be state where beneficiaries of allegedly churned trust account resided rather than 
in state where corpus of trust was located and securities transactions occurred)."
900,25," Interestingly, the statute of limitations for state securities law violations has been lengthened twice since the time relevant to 
this lawsuit. See N.M.Stat.Ann. § 58-13-42 (1984) (effective June 19, 1983) (four years); N.M.Stat.Ann. § 58-13B-41 (1986) 
(effective July 1, 1986) (five years)."
900,26," It could be argued that the rule announced in Stafford v. International Harvester Co., 668 F.2d 142, 150-52 (2d Cir. 1981), 
precludes the application of any New Mexico statute of limitations to Michelson's claims against the exchanges, since such 
claims could never have been brought in that jurisdiction. Stafford held that ""insofar as the purpose of the borrowing statute is . . 
. to prevent a plaintiff from forum shopping, it makes no sense at all to apply the shorter limitation of a state where the defendant 
could not have been sued."" Id. at 152 (footnote omitted). In this case, of course, the exchanges were initially dismissed from the 
action for lack of personal jurisdiction over them in New Mexico. The effect of Stafford here would be simply to dictate application of New York's six-year limitations period to the CEA claims. 
See id. at 154 (""Since there is nothing in this record to show that the action against [defendant] accrued for purposes of New 
York's borrowing statute anywhere other than New York, the borrowing statute is inapplicable and the action against [defendant] 
is governed by New York's . . .  limitations period.""). In fact, as indicated below, Michelson's CEA claims are timely brought under either a four- or six-year statute of limitations, and 
thus the Stafford rule is of no effect here."
900,27," It is therefore unnecessary to consider the effect that either equitable tolling premised on the defendants' fraudulent 
concealment of their alleged wrongs, see Korwek v. Hunt, 646 F. Supp. at 958-59 (holding that tolling did not apply), or class 
action tolling under the rule of Crown, Cork & Seal Co. v. Parker, 462 U.S. 345, 76 L. Ed. 2d 628, 103 S. Ct. 2392 (1983), would 
have on the calculation of the running of various statutes of limitations. "
901,28," Count X in the original complaint also charged all defendants with violations of CEA §§ 6(c) and 13(b), 7 U.S.C. §§ 13b & 
13c(b) (1982).  These claims were dismissed with prejudice in the 1985 decision for failure to state a private cause of action, 
Michelson, 619 F. Supp. at 739-40, and Michelson has not included them in the amended complaint. "
902,29," The exchanges' argument that there is no implied right of action under a given section of the CEA unless it was recognized in 
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith v. Curran, 456 U.S. 353, 72 L. Ed. 2d 182, 102 S. Ct. 1825 (1982), must be rejected. This 
court has stated in an earlier decision that Curran cannot be controlling on the question of whether a particular provision 
supports a private right of action if that provision was not invoked by the parties or considered by the Court in that case. See 
Fustok v. Conticommodity Services, Inc., 618 F. Supp. 1069, 1070 (S.D.N.Y. 1985) ( 17 C.F.R. § 166.3). "
903,30, See supra text at note 18 for a description of the RICO claims asserted against all defendants. 
905,31," This resume does not include those claims dismissed by the 1985 decision or those claims which, as indicated at various 
points in this opinion, are mistakenly described in the amended complaint as alleged against defendants other than those initially 
charged in the original complaint. "
911,1," The record does not make clear exactly which states, counties or municipalities have enacted the Code into law, or to what 
extent local legislatures have deviated from its terms when adopting it. According to the WFCA, the Code ""has been adopted in 
a majority of the counties, cities and other political subdivisions in the ten western United States (Alaska, Arizona, California, 
Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington) and is widely adopted in the thirteen southwestern and mid-
western states."" Brief of the WFCA et al., amici curiae, at 5. In addition, local fire officials may enforce Code provisions or 
standards even when their respective localities have not enacted these provisions or standards into law."
911,2," The WFCA revises the Code according to the following procedures. An ad hoc subcommittee is established to consider 
particular issues. Representatives of private industry are often invited to serve thereon. At the time of the events in question, 
such private industry members had full voting powers within the subcommittee on which they served. (The WFCA has now 
changed its rules so that private industry representatives no longer have voting power even at the subcommittee level.) If a 
subcommittee votes to propose an amendment to the Code, the proposal is referred to the WFCA's standing Code Committee, 
which publishes a notice in two national trade journals and then holds meetings on the proposed amendment. Anyone may 
attend these hearings, speak and present evidence, but only active WFCA members -- no private industry representatives -- 
may vote. After the hearings, both the original proposal and the Code Committee recommendation are again published in the 
trade journals. Finally, at the WFCA annual conference, where once more anyone may participate but only WFCA members may 
vote, the entire body of the WFCA approves or rejects the proposed amendment. "
913,3," By itself, however, this conclusion does not end the inquiry into either Noerr's applicability or Joor's liability. Antitrust law often 
impinges on First Amendment interests. Boycotts include an associational component, and an agreement to fix prices may of 
course be speech. Nonetheless, these activities can in certain circumstances be prohibited. HN6[
] The Sherman Act 
necessarily presupposes that the ""right of business entities to 'associate' to suppress competition may be curtailed."" Claiborne, 
458 U.S. at 912; see National Soc'y. of Prof. Eng'rs v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 697, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637, 98 S. Ct. 1355 (1978). "
914,4," See also Hurwitz, Abuse of Governmental Processes, the First Amendment, and the Boundaries of Noerr, 74 Geo. L.J. 65, 123 
(1985) (""In the absence of egregious conduct, a governmental decision favorable to the petitioner will negate the proximate 
causation of any competitive injury."")."
914,5," We must also dispose of a preliminary objection. Joor succeeded in its efforts to amend the Code and thus local fire safety 
laws. It claims, therefore, that its petitioning was ""genuine"" and cannot be called a ""sham."" Not so. "
915,," To be sure, the clearest examples of sham petitioning are those in which the defendant's aim was to harm a competitor directly, 
not through the governmental process that he purported to invoke. See, e.g., Energy Conservation, Inc. v. Heliodyne, 698 F.2d 
386, 389 (9th Cir. 1983) (baseless lawsuit allegedly designed to cause competitor expense and to generate adverse publicity). 
Perhaps because the term ""sham"" suggests this sort of situation, courts have sometimes asserted the mistaken proposition for 
which Joor contends. See, e.g., WIXT Television, Inc. v. Meredith Corp., 506 F. Supp. 1003, 1032 (N.D.N.Y. 1980) (""by HN9[
] 
definition a successful claim cannot be 'sham'""). HN10[
] But there are other instances of sham petitioning in which the defendant genuinely seeks to achieve his governmental 
result, but does so through improper means. See, e.g., Handgards, Inc. v. Ethicon, Inc., 601 F.2d 986, 993-94 (9th Cir. 1979) 
(infringement suit based on fraudulently obtained patent is in ""bad faith"" and thus actionable in antitrust despite Noerr), cert. 
denied, 444 U.S. 1025, 100 S. Ct. 688, 62 L. Ed. 2d 659, 100 S. Ct. 689 (1980); Israel v. Baxter Labs., Inc., 151 U.S. App. D.C. 
101, 466 F.2d 272, 278-79 (D.C. Cir. 1972) (misrepresentations inducing decision by administrative tribunal are actionable); 
Outboard Marine Corp. v. Pezetel, 474 F. Supp. 168, 179 & n.19 (D. Del. 1979). In such cases, the defendant may well succeed 
in procuring the desired governmental action, but has nonetheless misused his petitioning privilege. Thus defendant's ""success 
or failure"" is ""one indicator"" of whether his petitioning was a sham, Aydin Corp. v. Loral Corp., 718 F.2d 897, 903 (9th Cir. 1983), 
but it is not dispositive. HN11[
] Commentators occasionally urge courts to use the word ""sham"" only when referring to disingenuous -- rather than 
unethical -- petitioning. But in both cases there is a pretense of seeking an independent, impartial decision. Thus both may fairly 
be called shams. See Hurwitz, supra note 4, at 109."
915,6," A few other observations with respect to the Indian Head case may be helpful. HN12[
] The Second Circuit stressed that 
private bodies, unlike governmental actors, cannot be assumed to be acting in the public interest. See 817 F.2d at 943-44. True 
or not, this point overemphasizes the policy aspect of the Noerr doctrine at the expense of its other components. The court gave 
short shrift to antitrust defendants' petitioning rights in situations where they had not ""subverted"" the organization's code-
promulgating process, and it made no mention at all of their associational rights, which are plainly implicated. More troubling still, "
916,," the court held that defendant could not try to justify the organization's failure to approve plaintiff's product (which formed the 
basis of the lawsuit) by showing that plaintiff's product was in fact unsafe: ""The 'objective validity' of a restraint of trade has never 
been a defense to an antitrust charge. . . ."" Id. at 947. Thus Indian Head in effect suggests that defendants may owe treble 
damages simply for bringing forward undisputed evidence that a rival's product is actually hazardous. The Noerr doctrine exists 
precisely to prohibit such a result."
916,7," If the WFCA were an association of private interests putatively engaged in self-regulation, Sessions would have a very different 
antitrust claim. Joor's liability would probably not be altered, but the WFCA as a whole might then be subject to suit. Cf.  National 
Soc'y of Professional Eng'rs v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637, 98 S. Ct. 1355 (1978) (engineers' association was 
liable in antitrust for taking position that competitive bidding was unethical); Radiant Burners, Inc. v. Peoples Gas Light & Coke 
Co., 364 U.S. 656, 5 L. Ed. 2d 358, 81 S. Ct. 365 (1961) (allegations that gas producers' and sellers' association had with "
917,," anticompetitive intent refused to approve and to service plaintiff's product stated antitrust claim). But Sessions has not sued the 
WFCA as a whole, nor impugned the integrity of its ultimate decisionmaking process."
917,8," UL -- short for Underwriters Laboratories -- is a private, nonprofit corporation that establishes standards and specifications for 
products in a wide variety of industries. The UL label on a product indicates that it meets the relevant standards. The parties 
agree, and the district court found, that UL approval ""is essential to the successful marketing of a product."" E.R. at 695. "
918,9," In Noerr itself, defendants had allegedly made misrepresentations to induce executive action. See 365 U.S. at 129-30. 
Defendants apparently sought an executive decision to enforce existing law more strictly. See id. at 131. That is the kind of 
policy decision our analysis would probably exclude from the reach of the ""sham"" exception. In any event, HN17[
] a more 
recent Supreme Court opinion has clearly established that a person's petitioning immunity does not protect him from at least 
some deliberate misrepresentations made in pursuit of executive action. See McDonald v. Smith, 472 U.S. 479, 484, 86 L. Ed. 
2d 384, 105 S. Ct. 2787 (1985) (letter sent to president defaming plaintiff, a nominee for United States attorney, was not 
immunized by defendant's right of petition and was actionable in libel). Because such misrepresentations also fail to serve 
Noerr's policy or statutory interests, we see no reason to immunize them in antitrust if they are not to be immune in libel. See 
Hurwitz, supra note 4 at 83-84; see also McDonald, 472 U.S. at 484 (citing antitrust precedent in support of its holding)."
918,10," Sessions may of course also attempt to prove that Robbins made misrepresentations to private parties not in pursuit of its 
governmental aims, but rather to harm the tank lining industry directly. The antitrust actionability of such conduct -- regardless of 
Robbins' position on the Article 79 subcommittee -- was established in American Soc'y of Mech. Eng'rs v. Hydrolevel Corp., 456 
U.S. 556, 72 L. Ed. 2d 330, 102 S. Ct. 1935 (1982). Sessions may also proceed with its state law claims, which were not 
involved in this appeal. "
940,1," 49 C.F.R. § 1057 was modified in 1984 to eliminate the thirty-day leasing requirement. In any event, at the time plaintiff 
operated for NAVL, the requirement existed. "
951,*," The Honorable Julia S. Gibbons, United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, sitting by designation. "
958,1," PepsiCo and Coca-Cola argue O'Neill is an inappropriate antitrust enforcer by virtue of her failure to meet the ""target area,"" 
""direct injury,"" and ""zone of interest"" tests developed in Section 4 cases. The phrase ""appropriate antitrust enforcer,"" however, is 
unique to the various tests devised to restrict standing under Section 4 and is not particularly relevant to Section 16 standing 
principles. Under Section 16, no categories or classes of persons are automatically considered too distant to bring an antitrust 
suit. Thus, the fact that other soft drink producers or remaining independent bottlers might be more directly affected or suffer 
greater injury than consumers of soft drinks because of PepsiCo and Coca-Cola's bottling acquisitions does not necessarily 
preclude consumers like O'Neill from Section 16 standing. "
959,2," Coca-Cola desires this court to derive from Jeffrey v. Southwestern Bell, 518 F.2d 1129 (5th Cir. 1975), and Commonwealth 
Edison Co. v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co., 315 F.2d 564 (7th Cir. 1963), a general proposition that consumers who, by virtue of 
normal chains of distribution, are somewhat removed from a producer's or manufacturer's antitrust activity lack sufficient 
proximity between the antitrust violation and injuries suffered to maintain Section 16 standing. A close reading of Jeffrey and 
Commonwealth Edison, however, undercuts this suggested proposition. In Jeffrey consumers charged that utility rates for phone service were increased due to alleged preditory pricing schemes in 
which a subsidiary of Southwestern Bell had engaged.  Jeffrey, 518 F.2d at 1130. Consumers complained that losses incurred 
by the subsidiary during the period of predatory pricing were reimbursed through higher phone service rates. Id.  The court ruled, 
however, that the consumers were without standing under Section 16 because their injuries were not proximately related to the 
alleged antitrust conduct of the utility's subsidiary.  Id. at 1132. In large part, the court came to this conclusion on the ground that 
the utility's phone service rates were set by a governmental regulatory agency and not the utility. Id. Similarly, in Commonwealth 
Edison, electricity consumers were held to lack Section 16 standing to object to price-fixing schemes by manufacturers who 
allegedly sold Edison power generating equipment at inflated prices.  Commonwealth Edison, 315 F.2d at 566-67. Stressing that 
the Illinois Commerce Commission was responsible for fixing the higher utility rates, the court ruled the consumers' alleged injury 
of inflated electric costs was not proximately related to the manufacturers' antitrust activity. Id. The foregoing makes clear that neither Jeffrey nor Commonwealth Edison support the concept that consumers who are ""twice 
removed"" from antitrust activity will always lack sufficient proximity between the injury and antitrust violation to possess Section 
16 standing. Instead, both cases reflect that actions by regulatory bodies in setting utility rates interrupts the chain of legal 
causation required to sustain a Section 16 claim. As such, Coca-Cola's reliance of Jeffrey and Commonwealth Edison is 
misplaced. "
960,3," Coca-Cola's attempt to further remove O'Neill from the alleged antitrust violation by narrowing the relevant product market, 
however, is unpersuasive. Maintaining that syrups are, as a product, distinct from carbonated beverages is an overly restrictive 
definition of the relevant market. Coca-Cola's reliance on International Ass'n of Machinists v. Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries, 477 F. Supp. 553, 574 (D.C.  Cal. 1979), aff'd 649 F.2d 1354 (9th Cir. 1981), is misguided. There the court 
did not distinguish between crude oil and gasoline as products to limit the relevant market, but instead to demonstrate plaintiff's 
inability to establish causation between higher crude prices and higher gasoline prices absent any indication that plaintiff's 
gasoline specifically included defendants' crude oil. Id. In the case at bar, Coca-Cola does not and cannot assert that its syrup 
does not find its way into plaintiff's carbonated Coca-Cola products. "
969,1," The Supreme Court has consistently reaffirmed its Morton Salt holding. Falls City Industries, Inc., supra 103 S.Ct. at 1289; FTC 
v. Anheuser Busch, 363 U.S. 536, 552 n. 21 (1960). "
989,1," Defendants CSA, CLA, and Dr. Young Suk have been dismissed from the case. The only remaining defendants are NME 
Hospitals, Inc., National Medical Enterprises, Inc., and John E. Menaugh."
989,2," In my unpublished opinion dismissing this case, I noted that although a nurse may administer anesthesia, a nurse can only do 
so under the supervision of, inter alia, a physician. See Magit v. Bd. of Medical Examiners, 57 Cal. 2d 74, 83, 17 Cal. Rptr. 488, 
366 P.2d 816 (1961). I found that under such circumstances, by force of California law, anesthesiologists and CRNAs could not 
compete. I further determined that since California's law arose out of its exercise of its licensing of medical professionals, a 
matter within the state's police power, it was not preempted. See Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 84 L. Ed. 1311, 60 
S. Ct. 982 (1940). I concluded that because CRNAs and M.D.s could not compete, they were not participants in the same 
market, and, accordingly, plaintiff did not have antitrust standing. See Associated Gen. Contractors v. California State Council of 
Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 103 S. Ct. 897 (1983). All the above was, of course, reversed by the Ninth Circuit. 
Drawing upon the observation that ""a product should not be excluded from a market because it requires an additional input in 
order to be a reasonable substitute for other products in the market,"" Bhan, 772 F.2d at 1471, the court held that the fact that a 
CRNA must be supervised by a medical doctor did not preclude CRNAs from participating in the same market as 
anesthesiologists who, as M.D.s, of course require no supervision. Id. I leave to the reader the decision as to whether the issues 
are analogous. As a district court, I am bound by the circuit's decision, however ""misguided."" Brown v. Baden, 815 F.2d 575, 
576 (9th Cir. 1987). "
991,3," The approach taken by the Supreme Court seems to distinguish the handling of inferences in antitrust cases from all others. 
Such a distinction cannot be justified since a single federal rule governs all summary judgment. It may be, however, that the 
Court is inartfully making the point that where defendants have legitimate business reasons for the conduct complained of, proof 
of the conduct, vel non, even if parallel, is insufficient to provide a factual premise for an inference of unlawful conduct. See 
Nielsen Freight Lines, 602 F. Supp. at 1244-45. "
994,4," Plaintiff provided the court with an incomplete transcript of a purported tape recording of the meeting. The transcript is 
composed of fragments of conversation and, as a result, is virtually indecipherable.  Accordingly, I give it no weight here. "
995,5," Section 1 provides in relevant part that HN11[
] ""every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, 
in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" Section 2 provides in relevant part that HN12[
] ""every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or 
conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with 
foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony."" "
997,6," Obviously, a person may suffer harm unrelated to his or her business or property. The Supreme Court thus overstated the case 
when it declared that a literal interpretation of the statute would ""encompass every harm"" attributable to an antitrust violation. 
See Associated Gen. Contractors v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 529, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 103 S. Ct. 897 
(1983) (emphasis added)."
997,7," I have expressed my opinion that since ""antitrust violations are essentially tortious acts,"" and that ""an element of any action in 
tort is an allegation that the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff,"" it is unclear why ""questions of the existence of duty in 
antitrust cases have been denominated questions of 'antitrust standing,' rather than simply questions of duty."" NECA, 632 F. 
Supp. at 1407 (footnote omitted)."
997,8," The means chosen by the Supreme Court to distinguish persons who may sue from those who may not ""has not been a 
particularly successful technique for providing guidance to the lower courts who must apply the law on a day-to-day basis."" 
NECA, 632 F. Supp. at 1409 n.13. In like manner, because the line of demarcation between the issue of standing and the merits 
is, to say the least, imprecise, it is not altogether clear what aspects of causation are to be resolved at the preliminary stage and 
what aspects are to be resolved at trial. Compare Lucas, 800 F.2d at 844 (causation a standing problem), with William Inglis & "
998,," Sons Baking Co. v. ITT Continental Baking Co., Inc., 668 F.2d 1014, 1051 (9th Cir. 1981), cert.  denied, 459 U.S. 825, 103 
S. Ct. 57, 74 L. Ed. 2d 61 (1982) (causation a merits question)."
998,9," The word ""direct"" has been defined as ""proceeding from one point to another in time or space without deviation or interruption."" 
Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary 640 (1976). The word ""indirect"" has been defined as ""not direct; . . . deviating from a direct 
line or course: not proceeding straight from one point to another."" Id. at 1151. "
999,10," The Supreme Court decision in AGC tends to blur the distinction between injury and damage. A person is ""injured"" when a 
legally protected interest is invaded by another. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 7 (1965). ""Damages"" refers to the 
monetary compensation recoverable by a person who has been injured, that is, the ""sum of money awarded to a person injured 
by the tort of another."" Restatement (Second) of Torts § 12A (1965). It is true, of course, that treble damages are not 
recoverable under the Clayton Act unless actual damages are ascertainable, see 15 U.S.C. § 15(a), but this is not the same 
thing as saying that a person cannot sue unless he has suffered ascertainable damages."
999,11," Defendants contend that Bhan has not suffered injury because he made substantially more money after he left Manteca 
Hospital, and in fact has conceded that he has no evidence that he suffered any monetary damage as a result of the destruction 
of his business. This argument does not challenge the existence of injury, but only the extent of damage. See supra at section 
VA1. "
1000,12," As noted in section IV, supra, the jurisdictional inquiry is coextensive with the substantive requirements of the Sherman Act."
1000,13," Motivation plays a multifaceted role in proving an antitrust violation. In addition to forming a basis for inferring a conspiracy 
when presented in the context of parallel conduct, motive may also be relevant in showing that conduct unreasonably restrained 
trade. See, e.g., Cascade Cabinet Co. v. Western Cabinet & Millwork, Inc., 710 F.2d 1366, 1372 (9th Cir. 1983) (acting with 
anticompetitive purpose may suffice to permit presumption of anticompetitive effect under ""per se"" analysis); Betaseed, Inc. v. U 
and I, Inc., 681 F.2d 1203, 1228 (9th Cir. 1982) (for ""rule of reason"" purposes court is to examine intent of defendants as well as 
anticompetitive effect). Some authorities have criticized any inquiry into the state of mind of a defendant to prove a restraint of 
trade because, in their view, the actual intention of a defendant seldom determines whether a particular restraint is 
unreasonable. See, e.g., VII P. Areeda, Antitrust Law para. 1506, at 389 (1986). "
1001,14," Of course, defendants may have had economic interests different than the M.D. anesthesiologists and surgeons, and, in fact, 
Menaugh may have been acting only on behalf of the Hospital. I conclude only that the evidence before the court gives rise to a 
reasonable inference that the alleged co-conspirators were not acting as a single economic unit. The fact that some members of 
the alleged combination may have shared an identical economic interest is beside the point. "
1002,15," If the concerted action plainly has some anticompetitive effect, a showing of economic power may not be required. See NCAA 
v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Oklahoma, 468 U.S. 85, 108-110, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1984). An analysis of 
economic power is called for here because there is a complete failure of proof as to whether the exclusion of CRNAs from 
Manteca Hospital had an anticompetitive effect in a relevant market. See section VB1b(2), infra. "
1003,16," The geographic dimension of the market is arguably the most important consideration since the geographic dimension 
establishes the boundaries within which a particular product is presently available. In this case, the plaintiff has offered no 
evidence pertaining to the cross-elasticity of demand, and the court can conceive of no service that could substitute for surgery. 
In addition, with respect to the cross-elasticity of supply, there is no evidence to suggest that facilities in the area which are not 
presently offering surgical procedures could provide them. Even without such information, however, the relevant market in this 
case can be sufficiently defined by identifying the geographic dimension of the relevant product. See, e.g., Jefferson Parish 
Hospital, 466 U.S. 2, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551. "
1004,17," The record does not indicate the number of medical/surgical beds or patient days at Doctors Medical Center or Tracy 
Community Hospital, the two other hospitals known to be within 30 miles or 30 minutes of Manteca Hospital. The record does 
show that in 1983 Doctors Medical Center had a total of 148 beds licensed for acute care, and that Tracy Community had a total 
of 59 beds licensed for acute care. "
1005,18," Even if the Hospital had sufficient economic power in the tying product market, I would conclude that plaintiff could not prevail 
under a per se analysis. The third element plaintiff must prove is that the defendants' conduct affected a ""not insubstantial"" 
amount of commerce in the tied product. The tied product here is the provision of anesthesia services. As I explain below, there 
is a complete absence of proof regarding the effect of the Hospital's decision on the anesthesia services in the market. 
Moreover, if the Hospital's policy is analyzed as a concerted refusal to deal, the same factors require the same result. "
1006,19," The circuit's previous decision in this case held that the question of whether CRNAs' services may be substituted for M.D. 
anesthesiologists' services could not be resolved as a matter of law; thus the issue of cross-elasticity of demand is ultimately one 
of fact."
1006,20," Although plaintiff does not make the argument, it may be that the fact that Bhan was able to provide anesthesia services 
before the termination of the AAS contract provides a factual premise for an inference to be drawn that a CRNA's services are, 
at least to some extent, a reasonable substitute for an M.D. anesthesiologist's services. Yet the question of whether such 
services are readily substituted is open to question as a realistic matter. See Matsushita, 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. 
Ed. 2d 538. At least in part this entire case arose because some surgeons did not want to be responsible for the supervision of 
Bhan, and others felt CRNAs were not competent to provide certain kinds of anesthesia. Since I resolve the question based on 
plaintiff's complete failure to address the question of the distribution of anesthesia providers in the market or even the question 
of the proper measure of the market, I need not resolve the question of the propriety of drawing an inference in plaintiff's favor."
1006,21," It is unclear how many nurse anesthetists actually practice in the area. Menaugh, the Hospital Administrator, believed that 
there was at least one, and possibly three, hospitals which employed nurse anesthetists. In addition, an unspecified number 
practice in clinics in the area. "
1010,1," We assume for purposes of this opinion that the relevant sections of the antitrust laws apply to the situation before us. We 
question, however, whether Congress intended the antitrust laws to apply to the means by which a landowner conveys all or a 
portion of his bundle of rights in real property. See Souza v. Estate of Bishop, 594 F. Supp. 1480, 1482 & n. 2 (D. Hawaii 1984)."
1010,2, The only allegation in plaintiffs' complaint that applies to the Castle defendants is an allegation of Sherman Act § 1 conspiracy. 
1012,3," The Estate's extensive land holdings can be traced to the ""Great Mahele"" of 1848, the division and distribution of lands owned 
by King Kamehameha III. "
1013,4," In Foremost Pro Color, we said that HN6[
] ""in order to state a claim for relief under section 2, product introduction must be 
alleged to involve some associated conduct which constitutes an anticompetitive abuse or leverage of monopoly power, or a 
predatory or exclusionary means of attempting to monopolize the relevant market, rather than aggressive competition on the 
merits."" 703 F.2d at 545-46. In the present case, plaintiffs offer no evidence that the Bishop Estate's lease-only policy is anything 
other than ""aggressive competition on the merits."" See also 2 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law para. 614 (1978) (""We 
emphasize that criminal sanctions or damages cannot properly be imposed on a monopolist who has not engaged in 
reprehensible behavior""). "
1016,1," The state law claims included breach of contract, violations of Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Law, misappropriation of trade 
secrets and proprietary business information, and claims based on unjust enrichment and quantum meruit. "
1017,2," The disputed incidents occurred from late 1981 through the middle of 1982. Defendant, Blue Streak Marine, Inc. [""Marine""] was 
formed in November, 1982; defendant, Blue Streak Inc. [""B.S. Inc.""] in 1983; plaintiff, Kustom Equipment Co., [""Kustom""] in 
August, 1984. Riggs sold his interest in Ocean Systems, Inc. [""Ocean Systems""] in August, 1984. P-28. New Orleans Technical 
Assistance Group [""NOTAG""] had been formed in 1979 to meet the demand for engineering services resulting from a change in 
Coast Guard regulations, but closed its offices in February 1983. "
1018,4," HN2[
]  15 USC § 1 provides in part: ""Every contract. . . or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce, among the several Scates, … is declared to be illegal…."""

] An evil intent alone will not establish a rule of reason violation.  H & B Equip. Co. v. International Harvester, 577 F. 2d"
1018,239," at 246(5th Cir. 1978). Likewise, trade practices which advance legitimate business purposes and produce only insignificant 
and insubstantial restriction on competition are not unlawful.  Muenster Butane, 651 F. 2d at 297; H & B Equip. Co., 577 F. 2d at 
246. There must be an anti-competitive effect."
1018,6," HN7[
] Section Two of the Sherman Act provides in part: ""Every Section Two person who shall monopolize, or attempt to 
monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce …"" shall 
be guilty of an offense.  15 USC § 2. Monopoly power is the ""power to control price or exclude competition."" United States v. E. I 
du Pont de Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 391, 76 S. Ct. 994, 1004, (1956), quoted in Dimmitt Agri Industries, Inc. v. CPC 
Intern.  Inc., 679 F. 2d 516 (5th Cir. 1982)."
1018,7," HN8[
] Conspiracy to monopolize under § 2 claim requires proof equal to that needed to prove a conspiracy under § 1 of the Sherman Act. Solomon v. Houston Corrugated Box Co., Inc. 526 F. 2d 389, 396 (5th Cir. 1976); Scranton Construction Co. v. "
1019,," Litton Industries Leasing corp. 494 F. 2d 788, 782 (5th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1079 (1976). As discussed earlier, the 
plaintiffs failed to prove ""a unit of purpose or common design and understanding, or a meeting of minds in an"" unlawful 
arrangement."" American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 718, 810 (1946)."
1019,8," Riggs did not apply for or obtain a patent, trademark or any other legal indication of proprietary rights for this design. Plaintiffs' 
expert testified that within the mechanical design industry, there are no protections short of patent or trademark, other than 
common courtesy not to copy. It is usually just a ""gentleman's agreement"" not to copy someone else's design. "
1020,9," Krong, plaintiff's expert, testified that the Riggs system and the one used by Blue Streak varied slightly in dimensions but 
involved the same number of teeth and the same operating principles; it is the uniqueness of the operating principal which 
makes the two the same design. "
1028,1," The district court emphasized its reliance upon sections 106.5 and 109, which it construed to prohibit the city's transfer 
restriction. Section 106.5 provides: "
1029,," It is hereby declared to be the established policy of this State that the right of a municipality to acquire and hold rights to the 
use of water should be protected to the fullest extent necessary for existing and future uses, but that no municipality shall 
acquire or hold any right to waste water, or to use water for other than municipal purposes, or to prevent the appropriation 
and application of water in excess of its reasonable and existing needs to useful purposes by others subject to the rights of 
the municipality to apply such water to municipal uses as and when necessity therefor exists. Section 109 provides: (a) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that the growing water needs of the state require the use of water in * * * an 
efficient manner and that the efficient use of water requires * * * certainty in the definition of property rights to the use of 
water and * * * transferability of such rights. It is hereby declared to be the established policy of this state to * * * facilitate 
the voluntary transfer of water and water rights where consistent with the public welfare of the place of export and the place 
of import. (b) The Legislature hereby directs the Department of Water Resources, the State Water Resources Control Board, and all 
other appropriate state agencies to encourage voluntary transfers of water and water rights . . . "
1080,1," Some background information is taken from Betz v. Chena Hot Springs Group, 657 P.2d 831, 832 (Alaska 1982). "
1082,2," CHS has apparently abandoned its claim that the Betzes offered the amendment in bad faith. There is no support for such a 
claim in the record."
1082,3," AS 45.50.562 provides: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or 
commerce is unlawful."""
1082,4," AS 45.50.564 provides: ""It is unlawful for a person to monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with 
another person to monopolize any part of trade or commerce."" "
1084,5," We do not decide whether in fact this is an acceptable market definition, only that it is pled as such. "
1097,1," Count X of the complaint alleges in conclusory terms a class action. However, no motion for class certification has been filed to 
date."
1097,2," On May 31, 1985, Swaney submitted two affidavits, in support of its opposition to the Atlas Copco defendants motion to 
dismiss. (Docket 45 and 47). On June 28, 1985, the Atlas Copco defendants submitted another affidavit in response thereto. 
(Docket 52). "
1098,3," At the hearing held on May 29, 1987, Swaney's counsel renewed its request for additional discovery pursuant, to Fed. R. Civ. 
P. 56(f), particularly with respect to Air Power's involvement in the, termination decision and defendants contacts with Swaney's 
customers. (See Docket 46). "
1099,4," At the May 29, 1987 hearing on the motions to dismiss, Swaney's counsel stated that Davey was a competitor of Atlas Copco 
in the GA Series, or the oil-flooded rotary screw compressor, market. The Complaint alleges that Atlas Copco was the 
""dominant"" company in oil-free rotary screw compressor sales. "
1101,5," But see pgs. 31-32, infra. which discuss refusals to deal by monopolists. "
1103,6," However, HN10[

12 (S.D. Tex. March 24, 1987). "
1104,7," Plaintiff urges a per se analysis because ""Atlas Copco possessed monopoly power, or at least dominant market position, in the 
oil-free rotary screw compressor market, and the amount of sales involved would not have been insubstantial."" (Docket 48, pg. 
11). However, these allegations are in the brief, not the complaint. "

1110,9," Swaney alleges that it was still an Atlas Copco distributor and sales representative, as well as a certified and qualified service 
agent of Atlas Copco products, at the time of the alleged tortious interference by the defendants. (See Complaint, paras. 96, 97)."
1110,10," The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has ruled that HN35[
] "" [g]ood faith and fair dealing between parties are 
pervasive requirements in our law; it can be said fairly, that parties to contracts or commercial transactions are bound by this 
standard."" Fortune v. National Cash Register Co., 373 Mass. 96, 364 N.E.2d 1251, 1256 (1977). "
1111,11," Swaney's claim that defendants were unjustly enriched by Swaney's development of goodwill and financial investment in 
expanding the market is more properly considered under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A.  Zapatha v. Dairy Mart, Inc., 408 N.E.2d at 
1380 (termination of franchise agreement)."
1111,12," Any objections to this Report and recommendation must be filed with the Clerk of Court within ten days of receipt of the Report 
and Recommendation and must identify the portion of the Report and Recommendation to which objection is made and the 
basis for such objection. Any party may respond to another party's objections within ten days after service of the objections. 
Failure to file objections within the specified time waives the right to appeal the district court's order.  United States v. Escoboza 
Vega 678 F.2d 376, 378-379 (1st Cir. 1982); United States v. Valencia-Copete, 792 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1986). "
1121,1, A full description of the defendants is set forth in Wilk and will not be repeated here. 
1124,2," The Committee worked to influence legislation on the state and federal levels and engaged in informational activities to inform 
the public on the nature of chiropractic. All of this activity is protected under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine and I have not relied 
on any such conduct in reaching any conclusion in this case. The Wilk Court specifically approved the jury instruction used in the 
first trial that stated that defendants' advocacy activity directed to legislative and administrative agencies or bodies was protected 
if the ""defendants undertook such efforts to influence governmental bodies with a sincere purpose to obtain the governmental 
actions that they sought."" 719 F.2d at 229."
1124,3," The Judicial Council is now known as the Council on Judicial and Ethical Affairs, but I shall refer to it in this opinion by its 
original name. "
1125,4," The JCAH accreditation standards prior to 1983 did not permit a hospital to allow chiropractors on the medical staff or to obtain 
hospital privileges, except to the extent allowed by state law. (E.g., PX 6, 828A, 10A, 11A, 14A, 12C.) The legality of JCAH's 
actions prior to the 1983 revisions to the JCAH standards, and the responsibility of the member owners for such actions, will be 
discussed fully in the section of this opinion dealing with JCAH. I do not find that the AMA, or any other member of JCAH, is 
legally responsible for the pre-1983 accreditation standards. "
1128,5," Dr. Sammons was a willing participant in the conspiracy. As an AMA trustee, Dr. Sammons was on the Committee on 
Quackery Oversight Panel of the Board of Trustees of the AMA and recommended continued funding of the Committee with 
knowledge that its prime mission was to be to contain and eliminate chiropractic. (PX 1391.) Dr. Sammons presently is the 
Executive Vice President of the AMA."
1128,6," The matter is so clear that in 1979 an AMA lawyer agreed that a medical organization that engages in activities calculated to 
professionally ostracize any member who voluntarily engages in any kind of a professional relationship with a chiropractor is in 
restraint of trade, and a general boycott against all doctors of chiropractic is indefensible.  (PX 7184.) "
1132,7," Dr. Charles Harry Epps, an orthopedic surgeon, testified that some musculo-skeletal treatments by chiropractors are scientific 
and he appeared to include chiropractic manipulation among those treatments. (Tr. 1975-76.) Dr. Epps is presently a member of 
the Judicial Council of the AMA and he testified for the AMA. (Tr. 1932.)"
1132,8," At the beginning of the trial the Court told the parties that the question of whether or not chiropractic is scientific was not an 
issue in this case and would not be decided by the Court. A courtroom is not the proper forum for such a debate. Plaintiffs have 
submitted literally dozens of technical papers or reports (PX 7005-78) to demonstrate that there is a developing body of literature 
involving chiropractic and manipulative therapy (most of it dated since 1980) but I have not considered the contents of those 
papers for purposes of this opinion. "
1135,9," The material facts relating to the rejections testified to by the plaintiffs (and recited, for example, in the Plaintiffs' Summary of 
Proofs) are not in dispute and they will not be recited in this opinion. The disputed question is the source of or the basis for the 
rejection."
1135,10," Obviously, the boycott was not 100 % successful and there has always been some cooperation among medical physicians 
and chiropractors. "
1136,11," The AMA also relies on the favorable results it received in other chiropractic litigation, but none of those results is binding here 
and there are substantial differences among the various lawsuits that render comparison useless. "
1137,12," The appeal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons from the denial of its post-trial motion was decided in a 
separate order. The Court issued a similar finding against the Academy. "
1147,13," Despite the existence of this resolution, ACR staff occasionally advised inquiring radiologists that it would be appropriate to 
make prior x-rays available to chiropractors at the request of patients. ( PX 122A, 123, 279 Pa. 437, 124 A, 126.) "
1149,14," Therapeutic radiology, the treatment of cancer patients with radiation, is not involved in this suit. Diagnostic radiology is a 
consultative practice whereby radiologists, using various imaging techniques, attempt to detect pathology in the patient. "
1151,15," Certainly not all x-rays requested by a chiropractor are useless.  Chiropractors as well as medical physicians routinely take x-
rays for leg length measurements (Tr. 2413) and back pain syndrome and such x-rays easily could be taken by a radiologist 
without risking harm to the patient."
1151,16," This kind of equipment generally is available only at hospitals. It is equipment that is not owned by radiologists, but access to 
the equipment is, as described above, in the control of the radiologists who are members of the hospital's medical staff. 
(Stronach Dep. 16-17, Tr. 2426.) So a radiologist in that position at a hospital may, by declining to associate with chiropractors, 
deprive all patients of chiropractors access to that equipment. (Stronach Dep. 16-17.) "
1154,1," Although McDonald was not licensed in Davidson County to operate a taxicab service, Opryland Hotel and the Vanderbilt Plaza 
gave McDonald permission to operate a taxicab at their facilities. Subsequent, both rescinded such permission after being 
apprised of the controversy between the Metropolitan TaxiCab and Wrecker Licensing Board and McDonald regarding 
McDonald's operating a taxicab in Davidson County."
1154,2," Section 39-1-33 reads as follows: REQUIRED No person shall operate or permit a taxicab or motor vehicle owned or controlled by him and as defined in 39-1-7 of this Code as 
amended, upon the streets and roads of the metropolitan government area without having first obtained a certificate of public 
convenience and necessity from the taxicab licensing board. Metropolitan Code Section 39-1-33 (July, 1986)."
1154,3," This contempt of court proceeding resulted from an injunction previously issued against McDonald. Around August 1979, 
McDonald operated a nonprofit taxicab service that provided services primarily for senior citizens and the handicapped. 
McDonald accepted donations from the public. Metro Taxicab and Wrecker Licensing Board obtained a restraining order 
precluding McDonald from operating his taxicab service because McDonald did not have a Certificate of Public Convenience "
1155,," and Necessity. A final injunction was issued in December, 1981 precluding McDonald from operating his taxicab service without 
obtaining a license."
1155,5," Governmental entity is defined as ""any political subdivision of the State of Tennessee and any municipality, metropolitan 
government, county or airport authority"". Tenn. Code Ann. § 7-51-1002 (1985)."
1155,6," Tenn. Code Ann. Section 7-51-1003 (1985) provides in relevant part: (a) Every municipality, or other governmental entity, is hereby expressly authorized and empowered to protect the public health, 
safety, and welfare by licensing, controlling, and regulating by ordinance or resolution each private passenger-for- hire vehicle 
providing transportation services operated within the jurisdiction of the municipality or other governmental entity. (b) Every municipality or other governmental entity is empowered to regulate the following: (1) Entry into the business of providing passenger transportation service, including taxicab service, within the jurisdiction of that 
municipality or governmental entity; (2) The rates charged for the provision of such passenger transportation service; (3) The establishment of safety and insurance requirements even if they reduce the number of such private passenger vehicles 
for hire that otherwise would operate within the jurisdiction of the municipality or other governmental entity; (4) The establishment of stands to be employed by one (1) or a limited number of firms providing passenger transportation; "
1156,," (5) Limited or exclusive access by such passenger transportation service, including taxicab service, to airports or other facilities 
operated by or within the jurisdiction of the municipality or other governmental entity; (6) The drivers of private passenger vehicles for hire; (7) The routes and stops of fixed route private passenger vehicles for hire; and (8) Any other requirement adopted to ensure safe and reliable passenger transportation service. (citations omitted)."
1156,7," Specifically, Tenn. Code Ann. § 7-51-1004(b) provides: (b) All immunity of the state of Tennessee from liability under state and federal antitrust law is hereby extended to any 
municipality or other governmental entity within the scope of authority contained in this part, and, when so doing, a municipality 
or other governmental entity shall be presumed to be acting in furtherance of state policy. "
1157,8," For purposes of this analysis, the private contractor's liability is not addressed since McDonald has sued only Metro 
Government, Davidson County and the Taxicab and Wrecker Licensing Board. "
1163,*," The Honorable Horace W. Gilmore, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation."
1163,1," Appellants concede that the district court's disposition removed all federal claims from the case leaving the district court without 
jurisdiction over the remaining pendent claims because of lack of diversity. "
1164,2," INA acknowledges that a ""patent monopolist"" is not immune from the antitrust laws, but maintains it has not abused its patent 
monopoly power in such a way as to trigger antitrust liability."
1164,3," See United States v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 648 F.2d 642 (9th Cir. 1981); SCM Corp. v. Xerox Corp., 645 F.2d 1195 (2d 
Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 1016, 72 L. Ed. 2d 132, 102 S. Ct. 1708 (1982). "
1165,4," Barber-Colman Co. v. National Tool Co., 136 F.2d 339 (6th Cir. 1943), illustrates one way in which misuse of patents may 
result in antitrust violations. In Barber-Colman, the plaintiff licensor, seeking equitable relief, complained of defendant licensee's 
violation of a price control clause in a patent licensing agreement. Plaintiff had licensed defendant to use plaintiff's patented 
process on condition that defendant would not sell the unpatented product resulting from use of the process at a price lower that 
the price for which plaintiff sold the product. The court held this condition constituted a misuse precluding the aid of equity, and 
explained that using a patent to restrain commerce is not only beyond the scope of the grant of the patent, but also in direct 
violation of the antitrust law. In Brownell v. Ketcham Wire & Mfg. Co., 211 F.2d 121, 129 (9th Cir. 1954), the Court listed seven improper practices in 
connection with patents: (a) Use of invalid patents in price fixing; (b) Cross-licensing of patents; (c) Attempts to extend the scope of patent monopoly; (d) Illegal price fixing activities in connection with patents; (e) Tieing patents to unpatented devices or processes; (f) Seeking to extend the effect of an expired patent; (g) Misuse of patents.  "
1172,1," In 1981, 95% of the dental x-ray equipment manufacture sales in the United States was comprised of Belmont, General Electric 
(now Gendex), Phillips (intraoral only), Ritter, Dentalez (panoramic only), S.S. White (attachments for intraoral x-ray units only), 
and Siemens. The remaining 5 % included Healthco, which introduced its own intraoral x-ray equipment, Lumix, in 1981, 
Yoshida-Kayco, Sanko, Vacudent, MDT, Excell, Min x-ray, Moss, and Portaray. Siemens' sales of panoramic equipment 
increased from 32 % in 1982 to 41% in 1983, although their sales of intraoral equipment declined from 25% to 8% during that "
1173,," period. General Electric (Gendex) lost percentage points in its sales of panoramic equipment, going from 29% to 16%, while S.S. 
White, a company which left the market in 1985, lost sales in the intraoral market, going from 22% in 1982 to 14% in 1983. Dentists obviously have a wide choice in selecting a brand of dental x-ray equipment, and there is serious price competition 
between the different brands, as well. For instance, Healthco's Lumix in 1982 was 35% lower in price than Siemens' intraoral 
equipment. In August, 1983, the recommended retail price of Siemens' intraoral unit (Heliodent) was $ 4,650, compared to 
Lumix's $ 3,295 and Belmont's $ 2,595. In light of this substantial price competition, the Torrey Reports (Dental Equipment Sales 
Report) concludes that Siemens' overall market share of 31.3% in 1983 had declined to 25.6% in 1985, and its intraoral market 
share had dropped from 28.2% to 18.0%."
1173,2," Dental equipment dealers customarily sell products manufactured or distributed by many different companies. Accordingly, as 
part of its ""Marketing Program,"" Siemens has a service department to offer product support and to train, update and monitor 
dealer service technicians. At dealer training seminars, a Siemens field technician demonstrates installation of Siemens' 
equipment, evaluates the technical competence of the dealers' service technicians, and checks individual dealer locations to 
ensure that adequate tools, spare parts, and product manuals are available.  The field technician then completes a ""Training 
Familiarization Course"" form that Siemens keeps on file. Siemens' technical representatives also provide on-the-job training by 
accompanying dealer service personnel to installation locations. The technical representative completes a ""service report"" on 
each such visit. Siemens also monitors its dealers by requiring them to complete and return a ""Quality Assurance Checklist"" for 
each dental x-ray unit they install. Siemens provides follow-up calls on panoramic sales made by its full-service dealers. It 
seems clear that Siemens has made a substantial effort to ensure that the quality of service on its products is commensurate 
with the product itself. "
1174,3," Some of the independent service people that Schein D.E. recommends, and that dentists employ, are former or current 
employees of authorized service dealers' moonlighting on the side, who keep abreast of any changes or developments in 
Siemens' equipment by using the manual that Siemens is required by federal law to provide with its product. Schein D.E. takes 
no responsibility for the work performed by these independent service technicians. Dentists are not required to use the service 
organizations that Schein D.E. has recommended, nor are they required to inform Schein D.E. as to who performed the 
installation. Although Schein D.E. often attempts to ascertain the name of the installer selected by the dentist before selling the 
x-ray unit, it has no way of knowing whether or not the dentist uses that installer. "
1175,4," The sales figures for that period betray Hayden's assertions. In 1981, Schein D.E. sold $ 58,461.25 worth of Siemens 
equipment, while Hayden sold none. In 1982, Schein D.E. sold $ 347,525.00 worth of Siemens equipment and Hayden sold only 
$ 9,268.00. Likewise, in 1983, Schein D.E.  sold $ 336,285.00 worth of Siemens equipment that it had bought from Siemens 
through Hayden and Hayden itself sold $ 13,365.00."
1175,5," Schein's letter provided in pertinent part: We are prepared to work out accommodations with you to attempt to satisfy Siemens [sic] expressed concerns on the 
following subjects among others: (A) Siemens objection to any resale of its products other than to end users. (B) Siemens desire to know in advance who will install its products and that these persons are so qualified. (C) Siemens desire that dentists have a way of knowing that they can get products in their locations. (D) Siemens concern that the dentist know the identity of the seller -- H.L.  Hayden Co. (E) Any other concerns Siemens may have even if not listed here."
1175,6," Despite adoption of the ""Marketing Program"" in 1975, however, it is clear that on at least one occasion Hayden submitted a 
Siemens Heliodent (intraoral equipment) for warranty repair, even though the equipment, which had been sold by Schein D.E., 
was not under warranty. The equipment needed to be repaired because of faulty installation. To satisfy the customer, Siemens 
informed Schein that they were prepared to repair the equipment for a charge and shipping costs. Until the commencement of this action, Schein D.E.'s catalogs indicated that manufacturer's warranties applied to the 
equipment. This Court granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting Schein D.E. from advertising that the Siemens equipment it 
sold through its catalog was covered by a Siemens warranty. H.L. Hayden Co. v. Siemens Medical Systems, Inc., No. 84 Civ. 
0306 (S.D.N.Y. June 21, 1984) (mem. decision). Before the injunction issued, sixty-four dentists who had purchased Siemens 
equipment from Schein D.E. nevertheless mailed manufacturer's warranty cards to Siemens. Schein D.E. now supplies its own 
warranty for Siemens equipment. "
1176,7," Indeed, plaintiffs' voluminous and sometimes rambling brief in opposition to the various motions devotes over three-quarters of 
its 404 pages (excluding tables of contents and authorities, and other various references) to the section 1 claims. We suggest 
that represents an accurate breakdown of the true substance to the various claims asserted by plaintiffs, and we intend to follow 
a similar structure with respect to this opinion."
1176,8," We recognize that there is considerable debate amongst the various schools of thought as to the continuing wisdom of 
retaining a per se standard in all pricing cases. The rule, however, has proven resilient. It has weathered, for now at least, this 
torrent of intellectual criticism and remains intact. See Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 761-62 n.7, 79 
L. Ed. 2d 775, 104 S. Ct. 1464 (1984) (expressly declining to reject per se rule in pricing cases despite importuning by Justice 
Department, as amicus, to the contrary). We, of course, intimate no preference in this debate."
1176,9," Plaintiffs actually have asserted the existence of three separate section 1 conspiracies: a vertical conspiracy between the 
manufacturer, Siemens, and two of its distributors, Healthco and Patterson; a horizontal conspiracy between Healthco and 
Patterson; and a horizontal conspiracy between Siemens and Healthco. We find considerable difficulty with the last 
characterization. Plaintiffs allege that because Healthco, in 1981, introduced its own intraoral x-ray equipment, the Lumix, 
Healthco and Siemens are competitors. Plaintiffs' brief devotes considerable space to the vertical/horizontal distinctions. We 
appreciate the significance of those distinctions, but we underscore the fact that whether or not a given section 1 claim involves 
vertical or horizontal restraints, it must first and foremost involve a ""contract, combination, or conspiracy."" Holding as we do that 
plaintiffs have not presented evidence sufficient to permit an inference of any conspiracy, vertical or horizontal, we need not 
address the characterization issue in depth. We note, parenthetically, that the alleged vertical conspiracy clearly is the principal target of plaintiffs' complaint, and we focus 
our section 1 analysis accordingly. We are cognizant, however, of the horizontal claims as we proceed to a discussion of the 
facts, and we emphasize that we find insufficient evidence to infer the existence of any conspiracies, horizontal or vertical."
1176,10," Just as plaintiffs devoted excessive argument to the horizontal/vertical distinction, supra note 9, they go on endlessly about the 
need to treat all of the alleged conspiracies under the per se rule. We recognize that a vertical resale price maintenance scheme 
between Siemens and its distributors would be per se illegal.  Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 761, 79 
L. Ed. 2d 775, 104 S. Ct. 1464 (1984). Likewise, we recognize that certain horizontal restraints are per se illegal. See, e.g., 
Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States, 341 U.S. 593, 95 L. Ed. 1199, 71 S. Ct. 971 (1951) (division of markets); United 
States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 84 L. Ed. 1129, 60 S. Ct. 811 (1940) (price fixing); Paramount Famous Lasky "
1177,," Corp. v. United States, 282 U.S. 30, 75 L. Ed. 145, 51 S. Ct. 42 (1930) (group boycotts). Again, however, plaintiffs have put the 
antitrust cart before the conspiratorial horse. Section 1 explicitly requires the existence of a ""contract, combination, or 
conspiracy."" If and only if a conspiracy is proved does the analysis shift to the characterization issue (i.e., is the conspiracy 
vertical or horizontal), and only after characterization does the analysis shift to a determination of the proper legal standard to be 
applied (per se or rule of reason). Holding as we do that plaintiffs have not presented evidence sufficient to infer existence of any 
conspiracy, we need not engage in a per se or rule of reason analysis."
1177,11," Not only must plaintiffs show proof of a conspiracy, but they must also show that they suffered ""cognizable injury"" as a result of 
that conspiracy. Matsushita Elec. Indus. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 1356, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). 
See also infra note 27 and accompanying text (discussing private plaintiff standing under antitrust laws). Holding as we do that 
plaintiffs have not met their prima facie burden of creating a reasonable inference of conspiracy, we need not address whether 
plaintiffs have suffered harm flowing from that conspiracy. We note, however, that in the years since Siemens terminated 
Hayden, Schein D.E. continues to receive Siemens' equipment through dealers who ""backdoor"" the equipment to Schein D.E. 
(contrary to the supposed compliance of those dealers with Siemens' Authorized Dealership Agreement). Schein D.E. may pay 
higher prices for these backdoor Seimens products than it did when Siemens supplied plaintiffs directly, although Schein D.E.'s 
1985 catalog shows Siemens' intraoral equipment (Heliodent) at a ""super low"" price of $ 2,875.00. Despite Siemens' efforts to 
police their dealers, Schein D.E.'s sales of Siemens' equipment were almost as great in 1985 as in 1983 (Hayden was 
terminated in November of 1983). A summary of Schein D.E.'s gross revenues attributable to Siemens sales for the period 
between 1982-1985 is instructive:"
1177,1982," - $ 347,520"
1177,1983," - $ 486,000"
1177,1984," - $ 451,407"
1177,1985," - $ 447,000 Indeed, since Siemens terminated Hayden, Schein D.E.'s business has been robust. In 1984, its total sales increased 20% and 
its operating income increased 23.5%. Its total x-ray sales increased 37.5% and its total x-ray gross profit increased by 44%. In 
1985, Schein D.E. offered seven brands of dental equipment: Belmont, Gendex, Ritter/Midwest, Philips, Wehmern, S.S. White, 
and Siemens. It chose not to include at least twelve other brands that are sold in the United States."
1177,12," The Matsushita Court also held that if the alleged conspiracy is ""implausible -- if the claim is one that simply makes no 
economic sense -- respondents must come forward with more persuasive evidence to support their claim than would otherwise 
be necessary."" Matsushita, 106 S. Ct. at 1356. Unlike the predatory pricing scheme in Matsushita, however, the vertical or 
horizontal agreements alleged here are not implausible. If Healthco and Patterson could convince Siemens to terminate Hayden, "
1178,," thereby closing off Schein D.E.'s only source of Siemens' equipment, Schein D.E. would theoretically be dealt a crippling blow. 
Unlike a predatory pricing scheme, this type of agreement would not require that the conspirators endure long periods of lost or 
reduced profits, nor would the plan's ultimate success depend upon the garnering of monopoly profits, a scenario the Matsushita 
Court described as ""by nature speculative . . . [and] inherently uncertain."" Id. at 1357. Given the plausibility of the alleged 
scheme(s) in this case, plaintiffs need not come forward with more persuasive evidence than would otherwise be necessary to 
survive defendants' summary judgment motion."
1178,13," Plaintiffs argue that Monsanto is inapposite since that case involved an appeal from a directed verdict. We cannot agree. First, 
the standards for summary judgment and directed verdict ""mirror"" one another.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 
106 S. Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). Second, and more important, the Matsushita Court expressly held that the 
Monsanto standard applied in both the summary judgment and directed verdict contexts.  Matsushita, 106 S. Ct. at 1357 (cited in 
full above). "
1179,14," Siemens has no quarrel with the professionalism of Schein D.E.'s mail order catalog, but rather with the notion that a picture of 
its product with a very brief description of the equipment is sufficient to convince a potential buyer of the need to spend more 
money for Siemens' quality product than for any of the other similarly advertised, but less expensive, products. Indeed, a former 
Hayden employee who worked in mail order sales, and who now works for Healthco, attested that dental equipment is too costly 
and complex to sell by mail order."
1179,15," Siemens argues not that dealer service technicians make no errors, but that Siemens is able to train those technicians to be 
alert to certain potential problems and can then monitor their work and correct and prevent errors. (Plaintiffs include in their 
Appendix Exhibits several letters that Siemens wrote to authorized dealers about errors in installation.) It is for this very reason, 
to monitor and maintain control, that Siemens relies on an authorized dealership system. We note that Siemens instituted a 
rather substantial training and follow-up program for full-service technicians in an effort to help ensure quality control, discussed 
supra note 2. Further, and worse, there is evidence that non-technical personnel were working on Siemens' sophisticated equipment. 
Handwritten notations on some Schein D.E. invoices suggest that plumbers, electrical contractors, and dentists themselves were 
acting as installers."
1179,16," That factor was a consideration (though not a major one) in this Court's order of June 21, 1984, restraining Schein D.E. from 
advertising that there is a manufacturer's warranty applicable to the Siemens' equipment it sold without authorized installation. "
1180,17," Siemens offers one account (from a weekly Call Report of a Siemens sales representative for August 6, 1983) of one dealer 
who permitted a dentist (Dr. Bird) to use a Siemens unit for 30 days. Dr. Bird then bought the unit from Schein D.E. and Hayden, 
which sold the unit in Tulsa, Oklahoma on August 8, 1983. We note, parenthetically, that this purchase occurred after Hayden 
had given several assurances to Siemens that it would comply with the Authorized Dealership Agreement and not supply Schein 
D.E.  with Siemens' equipment. "
1181,18," We note that Schein D.E. is not the only mail order organization to provide interbrand competition. D.L. Saslow Co. also offers 
Belmont, Gendex, Phillips, and Ritter-Midwest brand x-ray equipment in its nationally-distributed mail order catalog, and there 
are eight other dealers who sell by mail order. No other dental equipment company, however, sells solely by mail order, reaches 
such a large clientele, or produces a catalog of the same high quality. "
1183,19," The newsletter was far more susceptible to an inference of conspiracy than is plaintiffs' reliance here on the assurance of 
Siemens' Vitt to Patterson's Frechette that, ""I will do everything in our power to offer to you the best possible market 
environment."" As discussed supra, a manufacturer's concern for a market that is conducive to allowing full-service dealers to 
flourish, particularly as that concern relates to ""free riding,"" is thoroughly legitimate and permissible. The newsletter at issue in 
Monsanto, however, contained an explicit reference to an apparent agreement by the manufacturer to maintain artificially resale 
prices at its company-owned retail stores so that those stores would not undercut competing retailers.  Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 
766. "
1185,20," The 8th Circuit has found that even a fifty percent market share was insufficient.  United States v. Empire Gas Corp., 537 F.2d 
296, 305-07 (8th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1122, 51 L. Ed. 2d 572, 97 S. Ct. 1158 (1977)."

] Any section 2 conspiracy to monopolize must be covered under the broader umbrella of a section 1 conspiracy in restraint of trade. The inverse, of course, would not necessarily follow. Professors Areeda and Turner have noted, ""The [section 
2 conspiracy] prohibition is curious, because, given § 1, it seems entirely redundant."" 3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law 
para. 839, at 358 (1978). Although we are unwilling to ascribe redundancy to Congress' action, especially in light of the 
insufficient briefing of this issue in the case at bar, we agree with Professors Areeda and Turner that the provision is, at a 
minimum, ""curious."""
1185,22," Professors Areeda and Turner cite, in addition to American Tobacco, three cases from which they draw support for their 
conclusion that competitors can conspire to monopolize in violation of section 2. 3 P.  Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law para. 
841 nn.2-4 (1978). Those cases, however, although arguably involving horizontal competitors, were not pursued under section 
2. See Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States, 341 U.S. 593, 595, 95 L. Ed. 1199, 71 S. Ct. 971 (1951) (claims under 
section 1 and 3 of Sherman Act); FTC v. Cement Inst., 333 U.S. 683, 688, 68 S. Ct. 793, 92 L. Ed. 1010 (1948) (claims under 
section 5 of Federal Trade Commission Act and section 2 of Robinson-Patman Act); United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 
310 U.S. 150, 165-66, 84 L. Ed. 1129, 60 S. Ct. 811 (1940) (claim under section 1 of Sherman Act). In fact, Socony-Vacuum, a 
horizontal conspiracy prosecuted by the government under section 1, merely adds to our ""curiosity"" as to the appropriateness of 
finding horizontal conspiracies to monopolize under section 2. "
1186,23," The second cause of action set forth in the complaint makes explicit reference only to attempt, not conspiracy. Plaintiffs argue 
that the conspiracy charge is made out because they reallege facts recited under the section 1 conspiracy charge. This merely 
buttresses our conclusion that a separate conspiracy has not been alleged. For example, paragraph 39 of the complaint, 
realleged for the section 2 claim and stating that Healthco and Patterson have conspired ""to exert pressure on manufacturers of 
dental equipment to eliminate sales by manufacturers to mail order dealers,"" makes the point."
1186,24," Plaintiffs do argue that a lunch between the store managers for Healthco's and Patterson's respective outlets in Tampa, 
Florida constitutes evidence of conspiracy. Plaintiffs assume that they must have discussed Schein D.E. and how to respond to 
its competitive challenge. The two store managers deny having had such a discussion. Even if they did, discussions of store 
managers hardly set corporate policy. While the plaintiffs have submitted hundreds of pages of briefs and thousands of pages of 
exhibits, none of this contains any hard evidence of a conspiracy between the parties to monopolize. "
1187,25," We must note in passing that there is a substantial inconsistency between plaintiffs' Robinson-Patman claims and the 
Sherman Act claims.  (Although a party is allowed to plead inconsistently, it cannot sustain opposition to a motion for summary 
judgment by straddling inconsistent factual assertions.) The premise of the Sherman Act claims is that Schein D.E.'s mail order 
operation is creating consternation in the dental equipment industry by offering low prices with which the others cannot compete 
and it, therefore, is being retaliated against. This third cause of action for violations of Robinson-Patman can survive as a matter 
of law only if Healthco and Patterson are undercutting Schein D.E. with lower retail prices than those given by Schein D.E. and, 
in addition, that these more favorable prices are made possible by the manufacturer discriminatorily cutting its wholesale price to 
them. Interestingly, however, the defendants' papers contain statements by Schein (in a taped conversation which he himself 
recorded) in which he brags to a major equipment manufacturer that he is able to put Patterson out of business."
1187,26," For example, plaintiffs attempt to prove their section 2(a) price discrimination claim in a roundabout and unacceptable way. 
They direct attention to sales made by Patterson and Healthco at prices which they claim were allegedly less than Schein D.E.'s 
price would have been if Schein's prices were increased by an imputed installation charge. Imputing this installation charge 
creates an uncertainty as to whether in fact the Healthco or Patterson prices were actually lower than Schein D.E.'s."
1187,27," Plaintiffs' brief, at points, confuses the distinction between the showing of injury to competition necessary to establish a prima 
facie case under section 2(a) of the Robinson-Patman Act with the showing of actual injury to the individual competitor 
necessary to confer standing under section 4 of the Clayton Act. The distinction is difficult, given the overlap between the two, 
but essential. HN12[
] Under section 2(a), in addition to other jurisdictional requirements, a plaintiff must show that ""the affect of [the alleged price] discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition."" There has been some dispute as to whether a 
""reasonable possibility"" or ""reasonable probability"" of injury to competition is sufficient to make out a prima facie case under 
section 2(a). In Corn Products Refining Co. v. FTC, 324 U.S. 726, 89 L. Ed. 1320, 65 S. Ct. 961 (1945), the Supreme Court 
invoked both a ""probability"" standard, id. at 738, and a ""reasonable possibility"" standard.  Id. at 742. Three years later, the Court, 
relying on Corn Products, said that a showing of ""reasonable possibility"" was sufficient.  FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. 37, 
46, 92 L. Ed. 1196, 68 S. Ct. 822 (1948). This Circuit has long adhered to a ""substantial probability"" standard.  Standard Motor 
Products, Inc. v. FTC, 265 F.2d 674, 676 (2d Cir. 1959). As plaintiffs correctly note in their brief, the Supreme Court, apparently 
in an effort to resolve any confusion that exists on this issue, recently reaffirmed its supposed fidelity to the ""reasonable 
possibility"" standard.  Falls City Indus., Inc.  v. Vanco Beverage, Inc., 460 U.S. 428, 434, 75 L. Ed. 2d 174, 103 S. Ct. 1282 
(1983). It is unclear whether Falls City will cause this Circuit to rethink its position, but it is immaterial for the case at bar. "
1188,," Making out a prima facie case under section 2(a) is separate and distinct from showing the requisite ""actual injury"" to an 
aggrieved competitor(s) under section 4. The Truett Court, in a passage plaintiffs cite for the wrong proposition in their brief, 
makes the distinction clear: By its terms § 2(a) is a prophylactic statute which is violated merely upon a showing that ""the effect of such discrimination 
may be substantially to lessen competition."" (Emphasis supplied.) As our cases have recognized, the statute does not 
""require that the discriminations must in fact have harmed competition."" Corn Products Refining Co. v. FTC, 324 U.S. 726, 
742, [89 L. Ed. 1320, 65 S. Ct. 961] (1945); FTC v. Morton Salt Co., [334 U.S.] at 46 (""the statute does not require the 
Commission to find that injury has resulted""). Section 4 of the Clayton Act, in contrast, is essentially a remedial statute. It 
provides treble damages to ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in 
the antitrust laws. . . ."" (Emphasis supplied.) To recover treble damages, then, a plaintiff must make some showing of actual 
injury attributable to something the antitrust laws were designed to prevent. J. Truett Payne Co. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 451 U.S. 557, 562, 68 L. Ed. 2d 442, 101 S. Ct. 1923 (1981). Holding as we do 
that plaintiffs have not suffered actual injury caused by any alleged Robinson-Patman violation, we need not decide whether a 
section 2(a) prima facie case has been made out. "
1189,28," We note that use of the word ""arrangement"" in section 340 may include relationships beyond the ""contract[s], combination[s], 
or conspirac[ies]"" proscribed by section 1 of the Sherman Act, and, to that extent, the Donnelly Act may be slightly broader in 
scope.  State v. Mobil Oil Corp., 38 N.Y.2d 460, 465, 381 N.Y.S.2d 426, 428, 344 N.E.2d 357 (1976). The New York Court of 
Appeals has held, however, that ""the term, 'arrangement,' takes on a connotation similar to that with which it is found in 
company, and thus must be interpreted as contemplating a reciprocal relationship of commitment. . . ."" Id. Just as plaintiffs' 
evidence raises no inference of conspiracy, we also find that it is insufficient to raise a reasonable inference of an illegal 
""agreement,"" as that term is construed under section 340. "
1191,29," The fact that on occasions in the early years Siemens did service Schein D.E.'s customers is not of controlling legal 
significance. Since the Schein D.E. catalog advertised the goods as being warranted by Siemens, Siemens had to protect its 
own reputation and good will. While Schein D.E.  may have believed at first that Siemens might honor the warranties on the 
charade that the installation had been done by Hayden, it knew by April, 1983, at the latest, that Siemens was asserting it would 
not honor sales installed by unauthorized dealers."
1191,30," Judge Leval's ruling in that case rested on statutes relating to the importation of grey market goods and certain Customs 
Service regulations not involved in this case. The issue was whether the grey market goods infringed under the trademark laws. 
This, in turn, involved Section 526 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C.A. § 1526, which makes it illegal to import merchandise of "
1192,," a foreign manufacturer bearing a trademark owned by a United States citizen or corporation without written consent of the 
owner."
1192,31," Siemens argues that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has indicated that a different product is involved when the 
installation is done by an unauthorized dealer. We have examined the communications with the FDA and find this argument to 
be frivolous."
1192,32," The only evidence proffered by Siemens is that of a Healthco employee who formerly was employed by the plaintiffs. No 
specific dentists are identified as having been switched. "
1193,33," It does not appear that Siemens is charging Healthco with bait and switch. Yet, we note with interest that some of Healthco's 
practices with respect to dental equipment and x-ray sales appear rather similar to Schein's."
1193,34," Siemens alleges that it did so simply upon the promises that Hayden would see that authorized dealers made installation in 
the future. This was obviously not a fulfillable promise since Hayden did not have nationwide authorized representatives and 
Schein was continuing to advertise Siemens' products. "
1194,35," We need not concern ourselves with whether this type of disclaimer can always be effective. Besides the stated warranty, 
there may be other warranties implied by law which are enforceable against Siemens, particularly where the defect is one that 
could not have arisen from installation."
1194,36," Of course, as Professor Hovenkamp makes clear, there are various forms of ""free riding."" On a separate level, then, it is the 
dentist customers who ""take a free ride on [Healthco's or Patterson's] services. . . but then go to [Schein D.E.] to make their 
purchases."" H. Hovenkamp, Economics and Federal Antitrust Law § 10.2, at 278 (1985). The ""free riding"" alleged in this case 
involves not the customers, but the discount dealer, Schein D.E. "
1200,1," Because we uphold the jury's finding of monopoly power, we need not consider the attempted monopolization claim that was 
an alternative ground for the jury's verdict. "
1201,2," For example, a ski resort with monopoly power was required to continue a marketing arrangement with its small neighbor 
where there was no legitimate business justification for discontinuing it, and the arrangement increased competition, and 
benefited consumers.  Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467, 105 S. Ct. 2847 
(1985)."
1201,3," The jury instruction on this issue was follows: To sum up, you must determine whether PRI and Gasco maintained monopoly power in a relevant market by policies and 
conduct which were not legitimate business decisions but were instead designed primarily to further any domination of a 
relevant market. . . . You should seek to determine if the challenged conduct is supported by legitimate business reasons or whether it was a 
deliberate effort to injure a smaller rival which caused defendants to sacrifice short-run benefits and consumer good will. "
1202,4," For this reason the ""essential facilities"" theory would not apply either. See MCI Communications Corp. v. AT & T Co., 708 F.2d 
1081, 1132 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 891, 78 L. Ed. 2d 226, 104 S. Ct. 234 (1983) (plaintiff must show control of the 
essential facility by a monopolist). "
1205,*," Honorable Robert P. Aguilar, United States District Judge, Northern District of California, sitting by designation. "
1219,1," We had accepted that case as related to Seiko Time Corp. v. Pascual, 85 Civ. 8030 (WK), yet another proceeding in the 
tangled web of litigation between these parties. "
1220,2," Despite this extensive argument of antitrust questions, Gemco tried to maintain the position that ""Gemco's antitrust claims 
against Seiko and Hattori [were] not before [the] panel."" Gemco's post-hearing brief, Def. Ex. 9 at 33. "
1221,3," The Second Circuit has held that unfair competition claims are arbitrable, Genesco, Inc. v. T. Kakiuchi & Co. (2d Cir. 1987) 815 
F.2d 840, 855; Necchi Sewing Machine Sales Corp. v. Necchi, S.p.A. (2d Cir. 1966) 369 F.2d 579, and Gemco makes no 
argument to the contrary. "
1247,1," See Tunis Bros. Co., Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 763 F.2d 1482, 1496 n.21 (3d Cir. 1985)."
1247,2," In Marrese, the court held that conduct clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy and actively supervised by 
the state is immune from antitrust liability. "
1248,3," Defendants have submitted deposition and affidavit evidence from Board members substantiated by Board minutes, attesting 
to the independence of judgment by the Board on the appropriate sanction for Dr. Friedman's misconduct."
1248,4, Plaintiffs submit nothing to rebut this evidence or even to suggest unlawful conduct by the members of the Board.
1248,5," The Board was confronted with: the decision of the ad hoc committee of medical reviewers that each of the seven charges 
against Dr. Friedman were substantiated, findings from which there was no appeal; a physician determined not to follow 
medically sound criteria adopted by DCMH for the health and safety of patients; a legal opinion that toleration of deviation from 
such an adopted guideline of patient care was an invitation to medical malpractice claims; and the position of the Director of the 
Department of Medicine that he would be unwilling to participate in the monitoring process that would be required of him or 
members of his department as part of the probation recommendation due to legal exposure should medical malpractice occur. 
The Board's decision to accept the ad hoc committee's findings of misconduct was consistent with Dr. Friedman's lack of appeal 
of the decision. Its rejection of the probation recommendation and vote for revocation of privileges was consistent with the fact 
that Dr. Friedman had not agreed to be bound by the criteria adopted by the hospital. "
1249,6," In Monsanto, the court considered the quantum of evidence necessary before a conspiracy could be inferred in a situation 
where a manufacturer had allegedly terminated one of its distributors pursuant to a virtual price fixing conspiracy with other 
distributors. The court emphasized that the manufacturer could refuse to deal as long as the decision was its own and that this 
principle would be seriously eroded ""[if] an inference of such an agreement may be drawn from highly ambiguous evidence."" 104 
S. Ct. at 1470. "
1250,7, Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).
1250,8," In Stone the court held that the opportunity to conspire, the power of one alleged co-conspirator to dominate the other, and 
close ties and conversations among them are not sufficient facts from which to infer a conspiracy."
1250,9," HN12[
] Monopoly power is the ability to control prices or exclude competition from the relevant market.  Fleer Corp. v. Topps Chewing Gum, 658 F.2d 139, 154 (3d Cir. 1981). "
1251,10," Since plaintiff cannot establish that defendant engaged in a specific intent to monopolize, plaintiff cannot show that defendants 
engaged in conduct to implement the specific intent."
1251,11, Supra slip op. p. 58-59. 
1252,12," Dr. William Atkinson, Director of Chest Disease at Presbyterian Hospital, stated to Dr. Friedman that it was necessary that you document the need for invasive procedures and that you document the results on the progress notes. Arterial 
blood gas analysis, recent x-ray and coagulation profile are a must prior to undertaking bronchoscopy. In instances where 
the bronchoscopy is done for therapeutic reasons, an ABG and chest x-ray should be done after this procedure or the next 
morning to evaluate its effectiveness. (DCMH Ex. No. 115, Ltr. from Dr. Atkinson to Dr. Friedman). "
1253,13," However, even if that were not so, constitutional due process guarantees would be satisfied if the practitioner was advised of 
the charges and given a reasonable opportunity to rebut them and to cross-examine his accusers. Here, beyond question, the 
essential items of notice and hearing were accorded Dr. Friedman. Moreover, an impartial hearing officer was appointed to 
conduct the proceeding and an impartial panel was appointed to decide whether the charges were substantiated. "
1265,1," In rejecting the per se rule of Schwinn and reverting to a rule-of-reason analysis of vertical restrictions on competition, the 
Sylvania Court acknowledged that such restrictions can have procompetitive effects: "
1266,," Vertical restrictions promote interbrand competition by allowing the manufacturer to achieve certain efficiencies in the 
distribution of his products."
1266,433," U.S. at 54. In Assam Drug Co., Inc. v. Miller Brewing Co., Inc., 798 F.2d 311 (8th Cir. 1986), the court upheld the validity of 
the vertical territorial assignments contained in the 1983 Miller Distributor Agreements under a rule-of-reason analysis. "
1267,2," In most contexts, attempts to distinguish between so-called direct and circumstantial evidence result in essentially arbitrary 
classifications. All evidence falls somewhere along a continuum between the irrelevant and the conclusive. Some evidence is 
simply more probative of a particular matter to be proved than other evidence. The distinction between direct and circumstantial 
evidence in antitrust law, however, has taken on a particularized meaning. Therefore, for purposes of the present motions, 
references to direct evidence relate to oral or written communications in which defendants expressly discussed the creation or 
maintenance of exclusive territories. References to circumstantial or indirect evidence relate to all other evidence which tends to 
either prove or disprove the existence of such a horizontal conspiracy. "
1268,3," In support of their conspiracy claims, plaintiffs rely extensively on deposition testimony of the defendants relating to the conduct 
of individual distributors. HN11[
] Before statements of alleged coconspirators may be admitted against other purported 
members of the conspiracy, plaintiffs must establish by a preponderance of independently admissible evidence the existence of 
the conspiracy and that each party against whom the statements are offered was a member of it. See In re Japanese Electronic 
Products, 723 F.2d 238, 260-263 (3d Cir. 1983), rev'd on other grounds, Matsushita, supra. At the hearing on the present 
summary judgment motions, plaintiffs' counsel made a proffer as to the independent evidence plaintiffs will rely on to establish 
the participation of each defendant in the alleged horizontal conspiracies. "
1275,4," Plaintiffs argue that this memorandum should be given little if any evidentiary weight insofar as each of the A-B defendants 
failed to produce this memorandum in response to specific document requests relating to any written communications from A-
B/St. Louis regarding territorial restrictions. Plaintiffs contend that their failure to do so casts doubt on whether this memorandum 
was ever sent to or received by any of the A-B defendants in New Jersey. However, the failure of the A-B defendants to produce 
this document during discovery demonstrates only that they did not retain the memorandum in their files and does not overcome 
Busch's testimony that it was sent to all A-B distributors nationwide, as reflected on the memorandum itself."
1275,5," Plaintiffs challenge the credibility of this testimony by DeMarco with evidence of the distribution practices of Rutgers 
Distributors in New York State. Rutgers is a wholly-owned subsidiary of High Grade. Although Rutgers and High Grade had 
identical agreements with A-B/St. Louis during the period of 1974 to 1982, Rutgers consistently sold A-B products to Class C 
licensees in New York outside of its assigned APR. Plaintiffs argue that Rutgers' willingness to engage in extra-territorial sales 
effectively undermines DeMarco's professed interpretation of the 1974 A-B Equity Agreements as prohibiting such sales. The A-B defendants contend that the beer distribution system in New York is dramatically different from that in New Jersey and 
most other states.  According to the A-B defendants, Class C licensees in New York act as independent or ""gypsy"" beer 
distributors. They have no contract with A-B/St.  Louis and purchase beer in large quantities from regular distributors at reduced 
prices for resale to retailers or consumers wherever they please.  The A-B defendants assert that such distributors comprise a 
fourth tier in the beer distribution chain in New York for which there is no analogue in New Jersey. Rutgers' sales of A-B brands to Class C licensees in New York appear to have no relevance to the subject of this lawsuit. This 
case pertains to the origin of territorial restraints on the wholesale distribution of A-B products to retail accounts. There is no 
evidence that Rutgers ever sold A-B beer to retail accounts located outside its assigned APR. Thus, in this critical respect, there 
is no evidence that Rutgers' conduct was inconsistent with that of High Grade. "
1282,6," The independently admissible evidence on which plaintiffs rely to establish the existence of a conspiracy among the Miller 
defendants and the participation of each of the Miller defendants in the alleged conspiracy was proffered by them on the hearing 
on these motions. "
1283,7," The inference of conspiracy would be all the more compelling in view of the fact that the very existence of sales outside the 
Miller-assigned territories detracts from the credibility of the Miller defendants' purported fear of provoking brewer sanctions by 
engaging in such sales."
1283,8," Plaintiffs argue, apparently in the alternative, that these direct communications are evidence of the existence of a horizontal 
agreement between the Miller defendants not to sell in each other's territories. However, objections of this sort would be 
expected whether the distribution territories were established by horizontal agreement or vertical direction from Miller. If the latter 
were the case, the distributor also would be expected to complain to Miller about the extra-territorial sales by the other 
distributors. In its interrogatory answers, Kristen stated that it notified Miller that other of the Miller defendants were distributing 
Miller products in its APR so that Miller would not hold Kristen responsible if any of these products did not meet Miller's quality 
standards. Furthermore, the nature and substance of Kristen's communications with Trip do not support the inference of conspiracy. 
Plaintiffs contend that Agnes Kristen, Vice-President of Kristen, telephoned Francis Tripucka, President of Trip, and ""requested 
him not to sell Miller beer to retailers located in her territory."" However, in her deposition testimony and in an affidavit submitted 
in response to plaintiffs' opposition to the present summary judgment motion, Agnes Kristen stated that the purpose of her 
phone call to Mr. Tripucka was to advise him that a single retailer in Kristen's APR, Chas Vic, was in default on its credit 
obligations and that she believed that credit sales to Chas Vic by Trip would be in violation of the New Jersey ABC regulations. 
Under N.J.A.C. 13:2-24.4, in the event a retailer defaults on its credit obligations to a wholesale distributor, the distributor is 
required to notify all other distributors of the default, and credit sales to the defaulting retailer are prohibited until the default is 
cured. N.J.A.C. 13:24.4(c)(2). So long as the retailer remains in default, sales can only be made on a C.O.D. basis. When 
Kristen put Chas Vic on C.O.D., Chas Vic's owner told Kristen's salesman that Chas Vic was still able to obtain credit from Trip. 
Kristen testified that she called Tripucka to inform him of the fact that Chas Vic was in default. There is no evidence that Kristen ever requested that Trip refrain from selling Miller products to Chas Vic or any other retailer in 
Kristen's territory. At best, the evidence of this telephone communication demonstrates only an opportunity to enter into an 
unlawful agreement. As previously noted, such evidence is insufficient to defeat summary judgment. Venzie, 521 F.2d at 1313. "
1284,9," There is additional evidence that Point Pleasant's sales to this single retailer did not result from an agreement between South 
Jersey Distributors, Inc. and Point Pleasant to allocate this retail account to Point Pleasant. John Wardell of Point Pleasant 
testified that the ""Miller Brewery wants full distribution and they want to be selling every account, every retail license, in the 
market . . . Prior to '81 . . . [the Village Pub] would not buy from . . . [South Jersey Distributors, Inc.], and, as I remember, Miller 
wanted them serviced and wanted the distribution and they said to go ahead and serve them."" This testimony shows that Point 
Pleasant's sales to the Village Pub were made at the direction and with the permission of Miller. Moreover, Beach Haven is located at the southernmost end of Long Beach Island. Point Pleasant's Miller territory did not include 
Long Beach Island although it sold other brands of beer there. As the plaintiffs themselves note in their opposition brief, ""in order 
to reach Beach Haven, Point Pleasant trucks had to take a narrow causeway out to Long Beach Island, and had to pass through 
the Town of Ship Bottom, where Point Pleasant had retail accounts to whom they regularly sold other brands of beer, but not 
Miller."" I can conceive of no business reason for Point Pleasant and South Jersey Distributors, Inc. to have divided retail 
accounts for the distribution of Miller products on Long Beach Island in such a seemingly haphazard and economically senseless 
manner. The only rational inference which can be drawn from the evidence of Point Pleasant's sales to the Village Pub is that 
Point Pleasant was simply responding to the vertical direction of Miller. Apart from its sales to the Village Pub, Wardell testified that Point Pleasant had also sold Miller products to one retailer in Ship 
Bottom and possibly two or three other retailers on Long Beach Island. However, there is no evidence regarding the factual 
circumstances surrounding these sales. "
1285,10," Plaintiffs argue that the evidence of Warren's extra-territorial sales presented by way of the Banko affidavit should not be 
credited by the court on the present motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs contend that the information presented in the "
1286,," affidavit is ""inconsistent with"" or ""contrary to"" Warren's prior answers to interrogatories and the sworn deposition testimony of 
Edward Goracy. The record does not bear out this contention. In interrogatories served in June 1985, plaintiffs requested each 
defendant to set forth its total annual sales of Miller beer outside its APR. Warren initially objected to this request as 
""burdensome, oppressive and overbroad."" Following negotiations between counsel for Warren and the plaintiffs, Warren served 
supplemental interrogatory answers in which it stated that ""Warren estimates that prior to May, 1983, more than 5% of its Miller 
sales may have been outside its territory"" (emphasis added). During the course of their negotiations, plaintiffs' counsel 
apparently affirmed that this supplemental answer would be sufficiently responsive to the interrogatories at issue. During his 
subsequent deposition, Edward Goracy was asked whether ""more than 95% of [Warren's] sales of Miller beer . . . prior to 1983 
was to retailers located within [its] Miller APR?"" He testified that ""without the exact knowledge of [the] numbers, I would say that 
those figures might be close."" He did not insist that ""a more precise figure could not be calculated,"" as plaintiffs contend. Rather, 
Goracy testified that he could not provide a more precise figure without analyzing the customer billing invoices and/or sales 
reports for the years in question. The record further reflects that the documents from which plaintiffs themselves could have derived more precise figures were 
readily available to them. According to Goracy, he and plaintiffs' counsel agreed during their negotiations that ""if the plaintiffs 
needed further information regarding sales outside [Warren's] Miller APR that the documents would be made available at 
Warren's document production and that plaintiffs would compute these sales figures."" Warren produced this documentation in 
July 1985, but plaintiffs apparently declined to make copies or otherwise perform a detailed examination of this material. Plaintiffs further contend that the Miller defendants should not be permitted to rely on sales information which Warren refused to 
compile in response to plaintiffs' interrogatories. However, these interrogatories sought only the total annual volume of sales and 
deliveries outside Warren's APR between 1979 and 1984. The Banko affidavit contains additional information regarding 
seasonal fluctuations in Warren's extra-territorial sales and descriptions of certain of its out-of-territory retail accounts which is 
outside the scope of plaintiffs' interrogatories.  Thus, plaintiffs' objections to the Banko affidavit relate only to a single paragraph 
in which he sets forth percentage figures relating to the total volume of Warren's out-of-territory sales during 1982 and the first 
three months of 1983. Even if these precise percentage figures are disregarded, the fact remains that plaintiffs were on notice as 
early as the summer of 1985 that Warren had engaged in significant sales outside its APR estimated to have been in excess of 
5% throughout the relevant time period. Indeed, Dr. Stiglitz acknowledged during his deposition that he was aware of Warren's 
claim that sales outside of its APR accounted for approximately 5% of its total sales. Plaintiffs certainly should have anticipated 
that evidence of these sales would have a direct bearing on their claim that the Miller defendants horizontally conspired to refrain 
from intrabrand competition. In short, while Warren arguably should have supplemented its interrogatory answers with the percentage figures compiled by 
Warren and set forth in paragraph 2 of the Banko affidavit, its failure to do so does not significantly prejudice plaintiffs on the 
present summary judgment motion and does not warrant excluding this evidence from consideration. "
1289,11," Plaintiffs cannot argue that they were somehow prevented from securing such evidence through the discovery process. 
Certain of the Miller defendants asserted in deposition testimony and answers to interrogatories that the identities of retailers 
located outside their APRs to whom they sold Miller products during the relevant time period were ascertainable from their 
business records, including customer billing invoices and sales reports. There is no suggestion in the record or in their 
opposition papers that plaintiffs were ever denied access to these records. In fact, Edward Goracy has stated in an affidavit that 
Warren produced such records in July 1985. However, plaintiffs apparently did not avail themselves of the opportunity to copy 
this documentation. Nor is there any suggestion in the record that plaintiffs were ever unable to obtain the cooperation of 
retailers. "
1290,12," Plaintiffs also appear to assume that the only question at issue with regard to their conspiracy claims is whether exclusive 
territories were established by the brewers or by horizontal agreement among the defendant distributors. By assuming the 
existence of exclusive territories, plaintiffs fail to address an important difference between the defenses asserted by the A-B 
defendants on the one hand and the Miller defendants on the other. The A-B defendants readily acknowledge that they treated 
the APRs assigned by A-B/St. Louis as exclusive distribution territories. The Miller defendants concede only that they 
concentrated their sales efforts within their respective APRs. They assert, however, that most of them did not treat these areas 
as being exclusive, as evidenced by their extra-territorial sales. "
1291,13," Plaintiffs attribute the same conduct described in Section V.A.1.c.  of this opinion to both the A-B and Miller defendants and 
the description of this conduct will not be repeated here. In addition, the law and commentary thereon set forth in Section 
V.A.1.c. is fully applicable to the present discussion and will not be reiterated. "
1292,14," There is evidence that at least on one occasion Miller unambiguously directed one of the Miller defendants to refrain from 
selling a Miller product outside its assigned territory. Point Pleasant originally sold Lowenbrau beer as an import in a territory 
slightly larger than its Miller territory. When Miller purchased the rights to Lowenbrau and began brewing Lowenbrau in its own 
breweries in 1978, Miller instructed Point Pleasant to discontinue its sales of Lowenbrau outside its APR. Point Pleasant 
complied with this explicit direction from Miller. "
1297,15," The concept of market power has typically been applied in monopolization cases brought under § 2 of the Sherman Act, see, 
e.g., United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778, 86 S. Ct. 1698 (1966), merger cases under § 7 of the 
Clayton Act, see, e.g., United States v. Philadelphia Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 10 L. Ed. 2d 915, 83 S. Ct. 1715 (1963), and post-
Sylvania cases under § 1 of the Sherman Act challenging vertical geographic restraints under a rule-of-reason analysis, see, 
e.g., Assam Drug Co., Inc. v. Miller Brewing Co., Inc., 798 F.2d 311, 315-17 (8th Cir. 1986. However, the market power concept 
is equally applicable in analyzing the potential for monopoly pricing of A-B and Miller products in the wholesale malt beverage 
market in New Jersey by the defendants in this case. "
1299,16," Under Bresnahan's analysis, marginal customers are those who will readily switch to substitute brands of a product in reaction 
to a price increase. Inframarginal customers, by contrast, are those who more strongly prefer the brand and will switch to 
substitutes only at higher price increases. "
1300,17," Nor do Bresnahan or Stiglitz attempt to argue that there was oligopolistic pricing behavior among distributors of all brands of 
beer in New Jersey. "
1301,18," The Federal Trade Commission noted in a 1978 study that ""large changes in market shares in many states are evidence,"" that 
consumers of beer apparently do not ""display a great deal of brand loyalty."" Bureau of Economics, Federal Trade Commission, 
The Brewing Industry at 130 (1978)."
1301,19," For example, in Table 7 in his report, Myslinski shows the percent of 1982 volume for Budweiser 12 ounce can/six packs sold 
by each A-B distributor in New Jersey during promotional price months as follows: Distributor Percent Crown"
1301,60, .2 (1981) Harrison

1301,54, .3 Konrad
1301,42, .1 A-B Newark
1301,46, .7 Ritchie & Page
1301,36, .3 
1302,20," A number of other studies of the beer industry reached similar conclusions. A staff report of the FTC Bureau of Economics 
concluded that ""the weight of the evidence supports the view that the [beer] industry has actually become more competitive and 
that, in general, performance has been good."" Bureau of Economics, Federal Trade Commission, The Brewing Industry at 1 
(1978). Similarly, Dr. Kenneth Elzinga, after an intensive study of the beer industry, concluded: The statistics on the structure of the beer industry, the pricing and marketing conduct oif its members, and the profits it has 
received do not mark it as a monopolized industry. The extent of exits from brewing in the last decade indicate that this is 
hardly an industry in which an inefficient producer is protected from the chilling winds of competition. Elzinga, ""The Beer Industry,"" The Structure of American Industry, 246 (W.  Adams, 6th ed. 1982). "
1303,21," Bresnahan notes in one of his present reports that retailer demand directly reflects consumer demand. Thus, any conclusions 
regarding the market power of A-B or Miller at the consumer level will extend to the retail/wholesale distribution level as well. 
See Bresnahan II at 25."
1303,22," Plaintiffs have attempted to draw certain distinctions in their papers in opposition to the present summary judgment motions. 
They note that the New Jersey market was more highly concentrated than the nationwide market analyzed by Bresnahan in his 
prior studies. In particular, they highlight the small number of distributors of A-B brands in New Jersey as contrasted with the 
total number of such distributors nationwide. While the small number of A-B distributors in New Jersey might be relevant in 
assessing the potential for collusion among them in forming a conspiracy to restrain intrabrand competition (discussed infra), it is 
the total number of distributors of all brands of beer operating in New Jersey which is the relevant consideration in determining 
whether the wholesale interbrand beer market is so concentrated as to allow anti-competitive pricing practices by the Miller and 
A-B defendants. Plaintiffs offer no facts regarding total numbers of competing distributors. "
1305,23," A regulation promulgated in 1978 by the Indiana Alcoholic Beverage Commission (""Rule 28"") prohibited vertically imposed 
exclusive territories in the beer wholesaling industry. This regulation took effect in 1979."
1305,24," The four Indiana distributors of both A-B and Miller brands are Beerco, Tippecanoe Beverages, Bartholomew County 
Beverages and Rhoades Beverage. The two distributors which sell only Miller brands are Maco Beverages and Hamilton County 
Beverages. "
1306,25," In his second report, Bresnahan also analyzed the prices charged by certain Indiana beer wholesalers before and after the 
adoption of Rule 28.  He concluded from this study that the wholesale price of beer fell 12 % to 16.55 following Rule 28. Plaintiffs 
argue that Bresnahan intended his so-called ""before and after study"" to serve as ""a new damage calculation technique."" This 
contention is clearly incorrect. Bresnahan offers the results of his ""before and after study"" only to support the general proposition 
that intraband competition has the effect of lowering prices and, conversely, that restraints on intrabrand competition enable beer 
wholesalers to maintain artificially high prices. Nowhere in his report or deposition testimony does he contend or even suggest 
that his ""before and after study"" of wholesale pricing in Indiana could be utilized as a reasonable methodological means of 
calculating the amount of damages sustained by plaintiffs as a result of restraints on intrabrand competition in New Jersey. "
1307,26," In fact, for reasons he does not explain, Bresnahan used the March, 1986 prices of only those wholesalers who sold to 
accounts beyond the boundaries of their APRs. Bresnahan Dep. at 7.40:3-21."
1307,27," Bresnahan's ""before and after"" study might arguably provide some support for his ""transition to competition"" theory. 
Bresnahan argues that this study shows that the average deflated wholesale price of A-B and Miller beer in Indiana during the 
period of 1979 to 1986 was 12 % to 16 % lower than during the period of 1971 to 1977. However, the three graphs depicting the 
results of his study clearly show that the average deflated price of Miller and A-B brands had been steadily declining since 1971 
and that such prices actually levelled off shortly after the time Rule 28 took effect in 1979. Rather than continuing the overall 
trend of falling prices, the average deflated price of A-B and Miller beer remained remarkably constant between 1980 and 1986 
and even increased slightly. Bresnahan II, Figures 2, 3 & 4, at pp. 15-17. Furthermore, Bresnahan made no attempt in his before and after study to control for variables other than the adoption of Rule 
28, such as intensified interbrand competition possibly resulting from the introduction of new brands into the Indiana market or 
lowered laid-in costs of beer from the manufacturers, which might have contributed to decline in wholesale prices. Indeed, in a 
study of the brewing industry released in 1978, the FTC made the following observations: The Consumer Price Index for beer has risen at a slower rate than has the Consumer Price Index for all goods, indicating 
that the real price of beer has been falling over time. Again, by itself this fact does not necessarily indicate anything about 
competition in the industry. Costs in brewing may have risen less rapidly than the average because the industry is relatively 
capital-intensive and becoming more so. However, the data on profits indicate that the industry was unable to retain the 
benefits of cost reductions for itself (relative to the average for all products); thus, the implication is that competition forced 
any savings in cost to be passed on to consumers. Bureau of Economics, Federal Trade Commission, The Brewing Industry at 3 (1978). "
1308,," I conclude that Bresnahan's before and after study does not provide a factual basis for his ""transition to competition"" theory. "
1317,1," For convenience, we will hereinafter refer in most instances to the twelve plaintiffs collectively as Hasbrouck."
1317,2," Section 2(a), as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, ch. 592, § 1, 49 Stat. 1526 (1936), provides in pertinent part: HN1[
] It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or 
indirectly, to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, . . . where the 
effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of 
commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit 
of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them. . . . The appropriate remedy upon proof of a section 2(a) violation is an injunction prohibiting the unlawful price discrimination."
1317,3," Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides: HN2[
] ""Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of 
anything forbidden in the antitrust laws . . . shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained. . . ."" "
1319,4," Texaco does not argue that the services its wholesalers generally performed justified the amount of the discount and that, as 
wholesalers, Dompier and Gull were entitled to that discount whether or not they performed all of the customary wholesaler 
services. In any event, we express no view as to the merits of such an argument. We mention it only because of the emphasis 
that Texaco places on the claim that there was no evidence that Dompier and Gull were charged different prices than other 
wholesalers."
1319,5," Evidently, the phrase that the antitrust laws were enacted for ""the protection of competition, not competitors"" originated in 
Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 320, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1962) (emphasis in original). "
1320,6," The district court in fact instructed the jury that plaintiffs needed to ""establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the effect 
of the discrimination in price . . . had the reasonable probability of substantially lessening competition, or of injuring or destroying 
or preventing competition."" (emphasis added). "
1322,7," Further evidence was submitted to show that Texaco management was fully aware of the existing pricing practices and the 
negative effect such practices were having on direct supplied retailers. This evidence strengthens the causal connection 
between Texaco's violations and the damage suffered by Hasbrouck. See Perkins v. Standard Oil, 395 U.S. at 649."
1322,8," We note that, in any event, at least two of the three ""intervening causes"" referred to by Texaco -- the facts that Dompier and 
Gull made independent pricing decisions, and that their customers did so -- are inadequate as a matter of law. In essence, 
Texaco argues that a defendant may avoid Robinson-Patman liability simply by showing that the recipients of the unlawful 
discount, or their customers, independently set their resale prices. That view would preclude all Robinson-Patman claims 
involving secondary and tertiary line injury, since the antitrust laws do not permit sellers to dictate the resale prices charged by 
their customers. E.g., California Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 102-03, 100 S. Ct. 937, 63 L. 
Ed. 2d 233 (1980). Texaco's argument is directly contradicted by a long line of Robinson-Patman cases that have found 
wholesalers liable for unlawful price discounts passed on to their customers. E.g., Morton Salt, 334 U.S. at 37; Perkins v. 
Standard Oil, 395 U.S. at 642; Falls City, 460 U.S. at 428. "
1324,9," Recusal is also required for personal bias or prejudice under 28 U.S.C. § 144. This section, however, requires the timely filing 
of an affidavit alleging such bias. Because no affidavit was filed by Texaco, section 144 is not applicable. Although it is unsettled what timeliness requirements apply to section 455, it is clear that a party must have a legitimate excuse, 
such as newly discovered evidence, for failure to raise the issue at the trial level.  United States v. Conforte, 624 F.2d 869, 879-
80 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1012, 101 S. Ct. 568, 66 L. Ed. 2d 470 (1980). In this instance, we assume arguendo that 
Texaco's assertion of judicial bias in its motion for j.n.o.v. was sufficient to preserve the issue for appellate review. "

1332,*," Presiding Justice, Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, Division Five, assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial 
Council. "
1333,1," Section 16028 provides in pertinent part: HN2[
] ""(a) Every person who drives a motor vehicle required to be registered in this 
state upon a highway . . . shall, when required by a peace officer pursuant to subdivision (c) or (d), provide evidence of financial 
responsibility for the vehicle . . . .  [para. ] (c) Whenever a notice to appear is issued for any alleged violation of this code, . . . the 
cited driver shall furnish written evidence of financial responsibility, as defined by subdivision (b), upon request of the peace 
officer issuing the citation . . . .  If the cited driver fails to provide evidence of financial responsibility at the time the notice to 
appear is issued, the peace officer may issue the driver a notice to appear for violation of subdivision (a) . . . ."" There are various forms of proof of financial responsibility, but the most common, and the one at issue here, is a certificate of 
insurance.  The certificate must verify that the insured is covered for not less than $ 15,000 per person bodily injury, $ 30,000 
per accident bodily injury, and $ 5,000 per accident property damage.  (Veh. Code, §§ 16028, subd. (b), 16056.) "
1334,2," The Commissioner is of the opinion that an insurer may refuse to insure based on any permissible classification. Hence, an 
insurer may decide not to write any policies in a geographic area without violating the Insurance Code, and so the Commissioner 
is without jurisdiction to enjoin the conduct.  Presumably, though, the Commissioner does have authority to investigate a claim 
that insurers are refusing to write policies on the basis of race or any other prohibited classification, pursuant to Insurance Code 
section 11628.  We also note that under Insurance Code section 657, an applicant who is denied coverage by an insurer is 
entitled to a statement of reasons from the insurer as to why the application was rejected."
1334,3," All Administrative Code references are to this article, and are hereinafter denominated CAARP followed by the relevant section 
number."
1334,4," Points are accumulated based on accidents and vehicular offenses.  For example, a first moving violation is generally assigned 
one point, although a serious moving violation is valued at four points.  An accident causing bodily injury or over $ 250 in 
property damage is worth two points.  Three years is the maximum permissible period for consideration of such an event under 
the CAARP penalty point system.  (CAARP, § 2460.3(a).) "
1335,5," The eighth named plaintiff is the United Front Against Insurance Discrimination, a coalition of organizations ""to fight automobile 
insurance discrimination against residents of Los Angeles."""
1335,6," Three years is the length of time that the DMV is generally required to retain data concerning a driver's accidents or traffic 
infractions.  (Veh. Code, §§ 1807, 12810.5.) Most plaintiffs have been ""clean"" drivers for significantly longer than three years."
1335,7," In view of the remainder of our opinion, we do not address defendants' objections to the proffered evidence. "
1336,8," Plaintiffs do not attack the pre-1984 financial responsibility laws, nor do they contend that the 1984 Act denies them substantive 
due process or equal protection.  Moreover, plaintiffs do not allege that the Commissioner is improperly carrying out his duties or 
that any insurer is failing to comply with the law.  We also note that plaintiffs do not argue that private insurance rates are 
actually ""excessive"" in violation of Insurance Code section 1852.  Plaintiffs assert that even if the Commissioner and various 
insurers had been joined as defendants, and even if we found plaintiffs' legal propositions persuasive, we would be without 
power to remedy the situation through a decree directed at the Commissioner or any insurer."
1336,9," For their part, defendants do not strongly argue that the state has no responsibility or duty to provide access by all to insurance 
at rates set in a constitutionally permissible manner (i.e., neither arbitrarily nor capriciously). They do strongly maintain, however, 
that private insurers do not constitute an arm of the state, and their acts are not ""state acts"" cognizable under the Fourteenth 
Amendment to the United States Constitution or article I, section 7 of the California Constitution."
1336,10," We note that the statistics quoted by plaintiffs as establishing the number of citations issued under the 1984 Act prior to the 
trial court's hearing did not differentiate between those who could not afford or could not obtain insurance, and those who simply 
would not buy it even if they could afford it. "
1338,11," However, unlike California, Michigan required that all insurance rates be approved by its insurance commissioner."
1338,12," See Gay Law Students Assn. v. Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co. (1979) 24 Cal.3d 458 [156 Cal. Rptr. 14, 595 P.2d 592]. In Gay Law 
Students, we found that a public utility is more akin to a governmental entity than a purely private employer.  As factors leading 
to that conclusion, we noted the following: ""[Breadth] and depth"" of governmental regulation; a regulatory framework establishing 
that the state ""expects"" a utility to act like a governmental entity, not a private corporation; the fact that the prices charged for the 
utility and the standards of the facilities were determined by the state; the endowment of the utility with a number of the state's 
sovereign powers; the guaranteed monopoly status of the utility; the guaranteed return on investment; and the public's need to 
purchase the monopolistic utility's product.  ( Id. at pp. 469-472.) Insurance companies might possess only the last of the 
foregoing attributes: the public's need to buy the product.  Without more, that does not approach the situation described in Gay 
Law Students. "
1339,13," Plaintiffs have conceded that if after a due process hearing the same rates were approved as are now in effect, they would 
have no remedy."
1339,14," We did not reach this issue in Watson, supra, 212 Cal. 279, which concerned a substantive due process challenge to the 
financial responsibility laws, and plaintiffs do not quarrel with the result in that case."
1339,15," Plaintiffs cite Applebaum v. Board of Directors (1980) 104 Cal. App. 3d 648, 657 [163 Cal. Rptr. 831], for the proposition that 
private enterprises affected with a public interest must provide ""fair procedures,"" a notion akin to due process.  However, that 
case and the law review article upon which it relies make it clear that ""fair procedures"" extend only to membership decisions of 
work-related entities, such as unions or professional organizations.  The only exception is that the doctrine has been extended to 
a hospital's decisions concerning a doctor's staff privileges.  (Sloss & Becker, The Organization Affected With a Public Interest 
and Its Members -- Justice Tobriner's Contribution to Evolving Common Law Doctrine (1977) 29 Hastings L.J. 99.) Applebaum 
has no application to this case."
1339,16," We note, though, that there is certainly no ""statutory presumption"" in California that CAARP rates are higher than those in the 
voluntary market, in contrast to the described situation in Michigan. "
1340,17," In his March 20, 1986, decision, the Commissioner explained that a recent change in the CAARP regulations was designed ""to 
double the premium surcharges [of drivers with points] in order to place the increasing costs of liability insurance on the 
negligent automobile operator who has documented traffic violations.  This change is also necessary to reflect inflation because 
these fixed surcharges haven't been changed in past years when the base rates were increased."" This explanation takes into 
account much of plaintiffs' concern.  Before these changes were adopted, base rates, paid by all CAARP insureds, increased 
although the dollar differentiation between ""good"" and ""bad"" drivers remained constant.  In effect, the percentage differential 
between such drivers decreased each time that the base rates increased.  The prior $ 200 spread between the best and worst 
drivers did not fully reflect the actuarial difference in the cost of insurance between them.  Hence, plaintiffs were correct in 
asserting that good drivers in CAARP subsidized bad drivers. That concern now has less persuasive force."
1340,18," As plaintiffs have not filed a complaint with the Commissioner, nor joined him in the present case, we cannot determine 
whether the rates are actually excessive. We note, though, that such a claim was made in a complaint filed with the 
Commissioner by the County of Los Angeles.  Plaintiffs here are, of course, also free to file a complaint.  As stated previously, 
the Commissioner's final determination is subject to judicial review."
1340,19," One plaintiff, in his declaration, states that he believes it is ""unfair"" for him to be placed in CAARP, where he claims he is 
""lumped with bad drivers,"" just because of where he lives.  This argument was not set forth in plaintiffs' brief as evidence of 
""stigmatization."" Moreover, as plaintiffs themselves point out, 35 percent of those insured through CAARP are good drivers. 
Given the differentiation in rates based on driving record, and the foregoing statistic, it cannot be said that this declaration, if 
true, establishes stigmatization."
1340,20," Plaintiffs expressly concede for purposes of this suit the procedural due process adequacy of the CAARP rate-setting 
procedures. "
1341,21," See e.g., Bayside Timber Co. v. Board of Supervisors (1971) 20 Cal. App. 3d 1 [97 Cal. Rptr. 431] (Forest Practice Act 
resulted in an unconstitutional delegation-of-power because an industry committee was empowered to initiate rules that 
governed all lumbering in a region, preempting county regulation); State Board v. Thrift-D-Lux Cleaners (1953) 40 Cal.2d 436 
[254 P.2d 29] (striking down, in part on a delegation of power theory, legislation authorizing a professional organization to set 
minimum prices binding upon all members of the profession); Allen v. California Board of Barber Examiners (1972) 25 Cal. App. 
3d 1014 [102 Cal. Rptr. 368, 54 A.L.R.3d 910] (same); Wilke & Holzheiser, Inc. v. Dept. of Alcoholic Beverage Control (1966) 65 
Cal.2d 349 [55 Cal. Rptr. 23, 420 P.2d 735], result overruled on other grounds in Rice v. Alcoholic Bev. etc. Control Appeals Bd. 
(1978) 21 Cal.3d 431 [146 Cal. Rptr. 585, 579 P.2d 476, 96 A.L.R.3d 613] (fair trade laws upheld against delegation-of-power 
challenge because prices were set by individual distillers, not by industry association, and were enforced by contract)."
1341,22," To the extent that Rosner is inconsistent with the foregoing, it is disapproved. "
1342,1," In Shavers v. Kelley (1978) 402 Mich. 554 [267 N.W.2d. 72], the Michigan Supreme Court held that ""[motorists] are 
constitutionally entitled to have . . . insurance made available on a fair and equitable basis."""
1342,2," Every state which has enacted compulsory automobile insurance laws (whether liability insurance or no fault insurance) has 
also enacted procedures for review of private insurance rates, an assigned risk program, or both.  Most states go further, 
requiring advance approval of insurance rates by an insurance commissioner or board, but there appear to be none which do not 
recognize the obligation to make sure that insurance is available to those required to possess it."
1342,3," This claim, while plausible on its face, may be historically inaccurate.  According to Cal. State Auto. etc. Bureau v. Downey 
(1950) 96 Cal. App. 2d 876, 880-881 [216 P.2d 882], the impetus for the current assigned risk program was the refusal of 
insurance companies to insure small trucking companies regardless of their accident record. "
1343,4," The other forms of proof may be found in Vehicle Code sections 16053 (certificate of self insurance); 16054 (insurance policy 
or bond); 16054.2, subdivision (a) (cash deposit of $ 50,000 with the DMV).  The certificate of self insurance can only be issued 
to fleet owners of more than 25 vehicles.  (§ 16053, subd. (a).) The bond mentioned in section 16054, subdivision (a) is not in 
fact sold by any surety in the state.  It is self-evident that a person who cannot afford to pay the several hundred dollars required 
for minimum liability insurance is equally unable to deposit $ 50,000 in cash with the DMV as required by section 16054.2, 
subdivision (a).  Accordingly, purchase of an automobile insurance liability policy is, in fact, compulsory."
1343,5," The minimum insurance currently required is $ 15,000 liability coverage per person injured, $ 50,000 per accident, and $ 5,000 
for property damage.  (Veh. Code, § 16056, subd.  (a).)"
1343,6," The individual plaintiffs in the present case all reside in South Central Los Angeles, and the evidentiary record on which they 
base their motion for preliminary injunction refers to that area.  Statewide information on insurance rates, however, suggests that 
the problem of obtaining insurance at affordable rates exists in portions of Oakland, and probably in other low-income urban 
areas."
1343,7," For discussion of a similar problem involving property insurance, see Note, Property Insurance and the American Ghetto: A 
Study in Social Irresponsibility (1971) 44 So. Cal. L. Rev.  218. "
1344,8," The declarations refer to insurance rates as of 1985; current rates are generally higher and the magnitude of the problem has, 
if anything, become worse.  (See Dept. Ins. Auto Ins.  Premium Survey (July 15, 1987).) The survey gave the example of a 
policy providing minimum coverage issued to a 45-year-old married couple with clean driving records.  Such a policy would cost 
from $ 750 to $ 1,500 in South Central Los Angeles (an average of about $ 1,000).  It would cost from $ 250 to $ 400 in San 
Diego, and from $ 150 to $ 300 in Redding."
1344,9," As of 1985, $ 481 was the lowest assigned risk rate available for this territory.  (Current rates are higher.) It applied to males 
over 25, or females over 21, who do not use their car to drive to work, and have a completely clean driving record. It is possible 
that some other plaintiffs could have obtained assigned risk policies for $ 481, far less than the private rates recited in their 
declarations."
1344,10," Typically, assigned risk rates are much higher than private rates.  The converse situation in South Central Los Angeles arises 
not because assigned risk rates are low for that region -- to the contrary, that territory has the highest assigned risk rates -- but 
because the territorial differences in assigned risk rates are much less than the territorial differences in private rates. "
1345,11," Davis explained that residents can obtain insurance in only three ways, assigned risk, ""substandard companies,"" and 
insurance by mail.  The substandard companies charge more than assigned risk rates.  Companies operating by mail ""provide 
no service through agents or offices for acquiring insurance, servicing policies, or handling claims."""
1345,12," As summarized in County of Los Angeles v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1982) 132 Cal. App. 3d 77, 87 [182 Cal. Rptr. 879]: 
""[The] Commissioner has the power to take corrective action as he deems necessary and proper (Ins. Code, § 1858.3); he can 
impose a money penalty not to exceed $ 1,000 for each failure to comply up to a total penalty of and aggregating no more than $ 
30,000 (Ins. Code, § 1858.3); he can issue an order specifying in what respects a violation exists and require compliance within 
a reasonable time thereafter (Ins. Code, § 1855.3, subds. (b) and (c)); and in addition to the other penalties provided, he may 
suspend or revoke, in whole or in part, the certificate of authority of an insurer with respect to the class or classes of insurance "
1346,," specified in such order which fails to comply within the time limited by such lawful order of the Commissioner pursuant to section 
1858.3.  (Ins. Code, § 1858.4.)"""
1346,13," Plaintiffs challenge the insurers' claim that rates in South Central Los Angeles are actuarially sound, contending that so little 
private insurance is now sold in that area that the insurers' accident and loss computations are not statistically reliable.  Indeed, 
considering the disparity between private rates and assigned risk rates for that region, it is difficult to believe that both are 
actuarially sound.  The question is one which would have to be tested by inquiry into the rates at a trial on the merits.  At this 
stage of the litigation, however, plaintiffs have presented insufficient evidence for us to conclude that the insurers' rates lack 
actuarial justification."
1346,14," The fact that current territorial rates may be actuarially justified does not mean that a rate which placed less weight on 
residence would be unsound, or would be unfair to residents of low-risk territories.  As explained by the United States Supreme 
Court, discussing a company requirement that women pay more into a retirement program because they live longer as a class, 
""when insurance risks are grouped, the better risks always subsidize the poorer risks.  Healthy persons subsidize medical 
benefits for the less healthy; unmarried workers subsidize the pensions of married workers; persons who eat, drink, or smoke to 
excess may subsidize pension profits for persons whose habits are more temperate.  Treating different classes of risks as 
though they were the same for purposes of group insurance is a common practice that has never been considered inherently 
unfair. To insure the flabby and the fit as though they were equivalent risks may be more common than treating men and women 
alike; but nothing more than habit makes one 'subsidy' seem less fair than the other."" ( Los Angeles Dept. of Water & Power v. 
Manhart (1978) 435 U.S. 702, 710, fns. omitted [55 L. Ed. 2d 657, 666-667, 98 S. Ct. 1370].)"
1346,15," In Shavers v. Kelley, supra, 267 N.W.2d 72, the Michigan Supreme Court found state regulation of automobile insurance rates 
constitutionally inadequate, in part because ""[the] statutory structure against 'excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory' 
rates is without the support of clarifying rules established by the Commissioner, with legislatively sufficient definition, and without 
any history of prior court interpretation."" (P. 88.)"
1346,16," In 1978 the County of Los Angeles filed a complaint with the Insurance Commission, charging two insurers with 20 specified 
unlawful practices relating to territorial classifications. The Commissioner conducted public hearings and reached the following 
conclusions: "". . . . "
1347,," ""2. That the use of territorial classification does constitute a reasonable and credible rating criterion, but that this finding should 
not be considered a blanket approval of the territorial classification presently used by the insurance industry.  '[Concerns] 
expressed by many individuals who wrote to the Commissioners or testified at the hearings to express their sincere and honest 
bewilderment about the fact that such costs appear to fall more heavily upon those least able to pay are clearly well deserving of 
further consideration by the Department to identify these perceived inequities'; ""3. That the methodologies used to develop geographical rates reasonably achieve the goals intended and therefore are 
actuarially valid."" ( County of Los Angeles v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, supra, 132 Cal. App. 3d 77, 84-85, summarizing the 
Commissioner's ""Findings and Recommendations"" filed Dec. 20, 1979.) The county then filed suit against the insurers and the Commissioner.  The trial court upheld demurrers, with leave to amend as 
to the Commissioner but without leave to amend as to the insurers. On appeal from the latter ruling, the Court of Appeal held 
that the county had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies because it had not insisted that the Commissioner render 
findings on the specific unlawful practices alleged in the original complaint.  (132 Cal. App. 3d 77, 87.) We have not been informed about any further developments in this suit.  And despite the reservations in the Commissioner's 
1979 decision, the Commissioner has done little or nothing to curb pricing polices which ""fall more heavily on those least able to 
pay."" "
1348,17," Plaintiffs assert that a person insured under the program is often rejected or charged higher rates by private companies when 
he seeks additional insurance (collision or comprehensive coverage, or liability coverage above the minimum).  He may also be 
subject to discrimination when he later tries to leave the program and obtain private coverage. The Commissioner has taken 
note of this discrimination, but true to the philosophy that nothing is unfair which is actuarially sound, he has ordered the insurers 
only to desist from discrimination if they cannot show actuarial justification."
1348,18," In 1985 the insurers requested an increase in assigned risk rates of 60 percent.  The Commissioner granted only a 20 percent 
increase.  His opinion, however, makes no mention of affordability, but rejects the insurers' proposal because it did not take 
account of investment income."
1348,19," Amicus Consumers Union did appear at the hearing to set the rates which took effect in January of 1987.  It complains that 
while it was permitted to put on its evidence, it was not permitted to participate as a party and to cross-examine the insurers' 
witnesses.  Consumers Union further claims that the Commissioner's decision simply stated the alternatives and adopted one of 
them, without considering Consumers Union's contentions -- a format which impedes judicial review.  The complaints sound very 
much like those plaintiffs raise about Commissioner action under section 1852. "
1351,1," At the commencement of this action, NCA was joined by a co-plaintiff, the Mining and Reclamation Council of America 
(MARC). During the pendency of the suit, MARC, also a trade association, merged with NCA, with NCA remaining as the 
surviving association."
1351,2," As a consequence of the membership, Meridian has counter-claimed against NCA contending, by the filing of this suit, it acted 
in excess of its corporate powers and breached the fiduciary duty to deal in good faith with a member of the organization. In 
addition, Meridian has counterclaimed against NCA and MARC contending their joint actions in initiating litigation to deny coal 
exchanges violate federal antitrust law."
1351,3," Section 206(a) of FLPMA, 43 U.S.C. § 1716(a), states: Exchanges of public lands or interests therein within the National Forest System (a) Authorization and limitations on authority of Secretary of Interior and Secretary of Agriculture A tract of public land or interest therein may be disposed of by exchange by the Secretary under this Act and a tract of land or 
interests therein within the National Forest System may be disposed of by exchange by the Secretary of Agriculture under "
1352,," applicable law where the Secretary concerned determines that the public interest will be well served by making that exchange: 
PROVIDED, that when considering public interest the Secretary concerned shall give full consideration to better federal land 
management and the needs of State and local people, including needs for lands for the economy, community expansion, 
recreation areas, food, fiber, minerals, and fish and wildlife and the Secretary concerned finds that the values and the objectives 
which Federal lands or interests to be conveyed may serve if retained in Federal ownership are not more than the values of the 
non-Federal lands or interests and the public objectives they could serve if acquired."
1352,4," Three cases were filed in 1983 in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia challenging federal-for-private 
land exchanges. Civil Action Nos. 83-3320 and 83-3330 were filed respectively by NCA/MARC and NPRC against Meridian et al. 
challenging the Circle West exchange at issue herein. On November 28, 1984, the Honorable Harold H.  Greene, District Judge, 
in those actions granted Meridian's motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. As a result, plaintiffs commenced the 
present action in the District of Montana where the defendants were amenable to personal jurisdiction. The third action before 
the D.C. Court, filed by NCA and MARC, challenged the ""Corral Canyon"" exchange, one similar to the Circle West exchange but 
involving the Wyoming land interests of the Federal Government and Rocky Mountain Coal Company, a subsidiary of the Union 
Pacific Railroad. The import of the D.C. Court's resolution of that action is discussed in detail in the following pages."
1352,5," Section 2(c) of MLA, 30 U.S.C. § 202, states: Common carriers; limitations of lease or permit No company or corporation operating a common-carrier railroad shall be given or hold a permit or lease under the provisions of 
this chapter for any coal deposits except for its own use for railroad purposes; and such limitations of use shall be expressed in 
all permits and leases issued to such companies or corporations; and no such company or corporation shall receive or hold 
under permit or lease more than ten thousand two hundred and forty acres in the aggregate nor more than one permit or lease 
for each two hundred miles of its railroad line served or to be served from such coal deposits exclusive of spurs or switches and 
exclusive of branch lines built to connect the leased coal with the railroad, and also exclusive of parts of the railroad operated 
mainly by power produced otherwise than by steam. Nothing in this section and section 201 of this title shall preclude such a railroad of less than two hundred miles in length from 
securing one permit or lease thereunder but no railroad shall hold a permit or lease for lands in any State in which it does not 
operate main or branch lines."
1352,6," The Commodities Clause, 49 U.S.C. § 10746, states: A rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the 
Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title [49 U.S.C. § 10501, et seq.] may not transport 
from a State or territory or possession of the United States to another State, territory, or possession or a foreign country, an 
article or commodity that -- (1) is manufactured, mined, or produced by the carrier or is under its authority; or (2) is owned by the carrier or in which it has an interest. However, a rail carrier may transport such an article or commodity when it is necessary and intended for use in the business of 
that carrier. This section does not apply to timber and products manufactured from timber. "
1353,7," Section 37 of MLA, 30 U.S.C. § 193, states: Disposition of deposits of coal, and so forth The deposits of coal, phosphate, sodium, potassium, oil, oil shale, and gas, herein referred to, in lands valuable for such 
minerals, including lands and deposits in Lander, Wyoming, coal entries numbered 18 to 49, inclusive, shall be subject to 
disposition only in the form and manner provided in this chapter, except as provided in sections 1716 and 1719 of Title 43, and 
except as to valid claims existent on February 25, 1920, and thereafter maintained in compliance with the laws under which 
initiated, which claims may be perfected under such law, including discovery."
1353,8," In its motion, NPRC has abandoned Counts 8 and 10, and Count 11 alleges an Administrative Procedure Act violation for any 
error found in the remaining counts. Accordingly, the substantive allegations, Counts 5, 6, 7 and 9, are those considered by the 
Court. "
1354,9," The nomenclature accorded bar concepts often varies with opinion. Some courts and commentators use ""res judicata"" to mean 
both forms of preclusion while others speak of res judicata as ""claim preclusion"" and its counterpart collateral estoppel as ""issue 
preclusion."" To avoid confusion, the Court opts for the more self-descriptive terms utilized in the text. See 18 Wright, Miller & 
Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 4402 (1981). "
1355,10," The Corral Canyon exchange involved lands located in or near Grand Teton National Park in the State of Wyoming and was 
effectuated by a three-way transfer among the National Park Service, a subsidiary of the Union Pacific Railroad, and several 
eleemosynary institutions. "
1356,11," The D.C. District Court framed the case with three central issues: (1) no authority under the FLPMA to approve land 
exchanges, (2) restrictive provisions of the MLA and Commodities Clause are incorporated into the FLPMA, and (3) improper 
public interest evaluation. The D.C. District Court noted that these three claims ""constitute[d] the principal claims in the veritable 
fusillade of challenges that plaintiffs have launched against the Secretary's decision"".  617 F. Supp. at 588, n. 14. "
1357,12," Though a standing question might again appear relevant, the Court thinks not. The action of the Secretary in this case was 
under the authority ostensibly conferred by FLPMA § 206, and it is this provision which provides NPRC's standing. Other 
statutory provisions under which standing exists may be invoked. The invocation of MLA § 37 arguably invokes the MLA in 
general, in parts of which NPRC may have standing.  Accordingly, a standing question with respect to MLA § 37, in light of the 
FLPMA thrust, is not involved. Cf.  Naartex Consulting Corp. v. Watt, 232 U.S. App. D.C. 293, 722 F.2d 779, 790 (D.C. Cir.), 
cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1210, 104 S. Ct. 2399, 81 L. Ed. 2d 355 (1984) (no private cause of action under the MLA). "
1358,13," Judge Greene noted, and the Court thinks rightly so, that the legislative history of NLA § 37 amendment ""is weak authority for 
ignoring the plain language"" of FLPMA § 206.  617 F. Supp. at 589, n. 17. "
1359,14," Because the necessity of considering anticompetitive effects was ""left to another day"", the issue is not subject to issue 
preclusion. 617 F. Supp. at 591. "
1360,15," The Department of Interior has announced that it will consider potential anticompetitive effects of future land exchanges. See 
51 Fed.Reg. 12069 (1986); 43 C.F.R. subpart 2203. This announcement cannot be applied retroactively nor should it be viewed 
as a confession of error. It merely imposes upon the Secretary an obligation normally undertaken in other circumstances by 
other agencies."
1360,16," The Fort Union Region EIS considered, in part, the suitability of the McCone County fields for leasing. The Circle West I is 
included within the North Tract of the exchange, Circle West II is within the South Tract, and Circle West III combines Circle 
West I and II. "
1361,17," Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) methodology consists of cash flow simulation of the life cycle of mining operations and is one of 
three recognized valuation methods embodied in the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions, as 
incorporated in the FLPMA pursuant to 43 C.F.R. § 2201.3(b). "
1363,18," Subsequent to issuance of J. App. No. 43, rulemaking altered the citations to the planning rules. The current rules also do not 
require an amendment where the exchange conforms to planning decisions. See 43 C.F.R. §§ 1610.5-3(a), 1610.8(a)(3). "
1369,1," Administrative Judge Riotti's April 18, 1983 decision addressed PCI's claim that ""TNR was set up by Saft, [a large business], to 
act as a 'front' for the purpose of supplying Saft batteries under the pretext that they were manufactured by TNR."" The decision 
was limited to small business qualification issues under 15 U.S.C. § 632. See Adams's Decl. Exh. I.  Plaintiff's present claim is 
that these same actions constitute antitrust violations and the SBA's size determination is not controlling, because private 
antitrust claims are brought in federal district court pursuant to Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15; 28 U.S.C. § 1337(a), 
not in the SBA. Thus, PCI's claims that the SBA's proceedings did not provide a ""full and fair opportunity to litigate"" need not be 
addressed. "
1370,2," Although the Court in Matsushita did examine the economic theory of predatory pricing behavior and conclude that a ""predatory 
pricing conspiracy is by nature speculative,"" 106 S. Ct. at 1357, it did not rule that they are legal. ""The Court of Appeals found 
that [plaintiffs'] allegation of a horizontal conspiracy to engage in predatory pricing, if proved, would be a per se violation of § 1 of 
the Sherman Act. In re Japanese Electronic Products, 723 F.2d [238] at 306 (3rd Cir. 1983). [Plaintiffs] did not appeal from that 
conclusion."" 106 S. Ct. at 1355. Matsushita cannot be read to support Saft's proposition that conspiracies to engage in predatory 
pricing must be dismissed due to economic irrationality regardless of direct evidence of such conduct."
1370,3," Not all conduct affecting price competition has been considered per se illegal. Joint ventures and cooperative arrangements 
which are ""price-fixing"" only in the literal sense may be reviewed under the ""Rule of Reason"" analysis.  Broadcast Music, Inc. v. 
Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U.S. 1, 9, 19-23, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1, 99 S. Ct. 1551 (1979) (blanket license arrangement 
characterized as being not facially output-reducing but rather aiding economic efficiency); NCAA v. Board of Regents of the 
University of Oklahoma, 468 U.S. 85, 100, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1984) (joint selling arrangement may be pro-
competitive and thus analyzed under Rule of Reason); Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 62 L. Ed. 
683, 38 S. Ct. 242 (1918) (only ""unreasonable"" restraints are illegal under Sherman Act). Here, defendant Saft has not argued that the alleged conspiracy was pro-competitive because of special characteristics of the 
battery industry. Indeed, defendants' actions were secretive, unlike the openly acknowledged behavior found to enhance 
competition in the cases cited above."
1370,4," The Court is nevertheless troubled by plaintiff's theory of injury and has not addressed this issue because defendants did not 
raise the issue in their motions to dismiss, and the issue was inadequately discussed by both Saft and PCI in their later 
pleadings. Plaintiff claims that it has been ""injured by being required to compete with Saft and TNR at these unreasonably low 
prices."" PCI's response at 22; Complaint para. 14.  Hopefully plaintiff will develop and explain its theory of antitrust injury in 
accordance with governing caselaw as the case progresses. See, e.g., Brunswick v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 50 
L. Ed. 2d 701, 97 S. Ct. 690 (1977); Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149, 102 S. Ct. 2540 
(1982). Further, the standard of what constitutes a ""predatory price"" is unclear, Cargill, supra, 107 S. Ct. at 493, and may be 
difficult to prove adequately for damages measurement purposes. "
1371,5," Even without Calvert's residence during the relevant period of alleged illegal activities, jurisdiction under § 6-103(b)(1) would 
exist if any of the transactions in Maryland could support a cause of action for price-fixing. See In Re Mid-Atlantic Toyota 
Antitrust Litigation, 525 F. Supp. 1265, 1270 (D. Md. 1981) (preparatory meetings were ""an integral part of the price-fixing 
conspiracy)."" "
1372,6," Calvert also claims benefit of the ""fiduciary shield"" doctrine that ""contacts as a corporate representative on corporate business 
do not give rise to personal jurisdiction over the individuals."" Calvert's reply at 4, quoting Quinn v. Bowmar Publishing Co., 445 
F. Supp. 780, 786 (D. Md. 1978). However, such protection is inappropriate where the defendant is charged as being a 
conspirator in price-fixing. ""The 'fiduciary shield' does not apply where a corporate officer has allegedly committed a personal or 
business tort within the state."" In Re Mid-Atlantic Toyota Antitrust Litigation, supra, 525 F. Supp. at 1270-71. Furthermore, the 
fiduciary shield is irrelevant to the period before January, 1985, when Calvert resided in Maryland and managed Saft's sales 
program. "
1376,1," In 1936, Congress passed the Rural Electrification Act, 7 U.S.C. § 901-950, and authorized the Rural Electrification 
Administration to make loans to electrify rural America. Investor-owned utilities, however, did not take the initiative in extending 
electric service to most rural areas.  As a result of the need for rural electrification in Illinois, RECC, among other cooperatives, 
was formed in 1936, obtained a $ 260,000 RECC loan, and, in 1937, energized its initial 134 miles of distribution lines serving 
395 member-owners. RECC now serves over 4,800 member-owners with 1,200 miles of distribution lines."
1376,2," RECC is a member cooperative of Western Illinois Power Cooperative (WIPCO). WIPCO is a generation and transmission 
cooperative which has the responsibility for providing wholesale power to RECC and six other rural electric cooperative 
associations. In the late 1970s, WIPCO and Soyland Power Cooperative (a generation and transmission cooperative serving 15 
rural electric cooperatives) negotiated with Illinois Power Company to participate in the ownership of the Clinton Nuclear Plant to 
assure a stable supply of power and energy to their members at reasonable rates.  WIPCO now owns 9.5% of the Clinton plant 
and is thereby obligated to partially finance it. Since construction began on the plant, interest rates have risen sharply and the 
Three Mile Island disaster prompted new federal regulations which changed construction and engineering plans already in 
progress. These factors greatly increased the cost of completion, thereby raising WIPCO's financial obligation. The plant was 
originally scheduled for completion at a cost of $ 430 million; however, that figure has risen to at least $ 4.25 billion. Although 
WIPCO has put a cap of $ 450 million on the Clinton investment, its involvement in this project has caused rates to be higher 
than they otherwise would have been. "
1377,3," As we find review under Parker to be the proper course, analysis under Rice v. Norman Williams Co., 458 U.S. 654, 73 L. Ed. 
2d 1042, 102 S. Ct. 3294 (1982), is necessarily inapplicable. In Rice, the Court addressed the question of when a state law 
would be preempted by federal antitrust law."
1377,4," ""Although Parker involved an action against a state official, the Court's reasoning extends to suits against private parties."" 
Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v. United States, 471 U.S. 48, 56, 85 L. Ed. 2d 36, 105 S. Ct. 1721 (1984). "
1378,5," Plaintiffs' argument that the credits to the capital account are not paid back to the owner-members for many years after they are 
earned is of no moment since the decision to disburse such funds lies with the Board of Directors -- which, of course, serves at 
the whim of the member-owners. Further, the member-owners are free to structure and amend their by-laws as they see fit. "
1379,6," Plaintiffs point to Arkansas Elec. Coop. Corp. v. Arkansas Pub.  Serv. Comm'n, 461 U.S. 375, 394, 103 S. Ct. 1905, 76 L. Ed. 
2d 1 (1983), wherein the Court stated that ""there is evidence that even cooperative power utilities may engage in economically 
inefficient behavior."" Id. at 394 (citing R. Schmalensee, The Control of Natural Monopolies (1979)) (emphasis added). A close 
reading of Schmalensee's work indicates that to say cooperatives may engage in inefficient economic behavior is tantamount to 
saying that the world may end tomorrow -- yes, it could happen, but we do not have any empirical data on it yet. Schmalensee 
flatly states: ""Experience with cooperative ownership structures in natural monopoly sectors is not extensive."" Id. at 89. He 
further states: ""Very little empirical work has been done on cooperatives. In particular, the politics and economies of rural electric 
and telephone cooperatives have been little studied . . . ."" Id. at 91. However, even granting the proposition that cooperatives 
may engage in economically inefficient behavior in no way suggests that they engage in private price fixing agreements. "

1415,1," Bache and its affiliate Bache Group, Inc. have also moved for summary judgment in Gordon v. Hunt, 82 Civ. 1318 (MEL) and 
Korwek v. Hunt, 84 Civ. 7934 (MEL). For the sake of consistency, this opinion will refer to all plaintiffs as ""Minpeco."""
1415,2," Minpeco's claims under CEA § 4b, 7 U.S.C. § 6b, and the Martin Act, N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 352-c, were dismissed as to all 
defendants by endorsement dated November 9, 1987."
1415,3," Defendants' primary argument is that Minpeco has failed to produce sufficient evidence in support of its antitrust conspiracy 
claims.  Defendants then argue that because there is insufficient evidence of participation in an antitrust conspiracy, Minpeco's 
other conspiracy claims are similarly deficient. The conclusion that there are sufficient genuine issues for trial on Minpeco's 
antitrust conspiracy claims necessitates denial of the summary judgment motions as to all claims. "

para.  23,786 (CFTC 1987), a dominant position in the deliverable supply, as opposed to in the futures market, is a necessary 
element of a manipulative squeeze. As a result, Bache argues that knowledge of the size of the Hunts' long futures positions 
could not have signalled to Bache that the Hunts were engaging in a corner or manipulative squeeze. However, In re Cox is not, 
of course, binding on this court, and even if that decision were followed, evidence of Bache's knowledge of the Hunts' dominant 
position in futures contracts could still be relevant to the question whether Bache knew of the alleged conspiracy."

1423,13," This argument is undercut by the decision in Fustok v. ContiCommodity Services, Inc., 610 F. Supp. 986, 989 (S.D.N.Y. 1985) 
granting defendants summary judgment on Fustok's claims of unauthorized trading. Evidence showed that Fustok authorized

stronger than in Apex. In this case, unlike in Apex, the plaintiff has alleged more than one instance of acts contrary to the 
defendant's self-interest and the allegations are supported in the record by plaintiff's expert or Hunt's statements."
1426,21," This opinion does not address the issues raised by Merrill Lynch as to whether Minpeco's claims of aiding and abetting and 
attempted manipulation under the Commodity Exchange Act must be dismissed as a matter of law. These issues, to which 
Minpeco has not yet responded, will be decided at a later date. "
1431,1," The complaint also alleged a violation of section 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 14. The District Court dismissed the Clayton

described the rule as follows: HN11[
] ""If the defendant's prices were below average total cost but above average variable cost, the plaintiff bears the 
burden of showing defendant's pricing was predatory. If, however, the plaintiff proves that the defendant's prices were 
below average variable cost, the plaintiff has established a prima facie case of predatory pricing and the burden shifts to the "
1436,," defendant to prove that the prices were justified without regard to any anticipated destructive effect they might have on 
competitors."" "

of the company,"" Jose A. Rivera, the Comptroller, ""who directs all the financial functions of the company,"" Eliseo Rivera, General 
Sales Manager, and Jose M. Torres, Operations Manager, all reside in Puerto Rico. "
1454,1," Because we uphold the jury's finding of monopoly power, we need not consider the attempted monopolization claim that was 
an alternative ground for the jury's verdict. "
1455,2," For example, a ski resort with monopoly power was required to continue a marketing arrangement with its small neighbor 
where there was no legitimate business justification for discontinuing it, and the arrangement increased competition and 
benefited customers. Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585 (1985)."
1455,3," The jury instruction on this issue was: To sum up, you must determine whether PRI and Gasco maintained monopoly power in a relevant market by policies and 
conduct which were not legitimate business decisions but were instead designed primarily to further any domination of a relevant 
market. . . . You should seek to determine if the challenged conduct is supported by legitimate business reasons or whether it was a 
deliberate effort to injure a small rival which caused defendants to sacrifice short-run benefits and consumer good will. "
1456,4," For this reason the ""essential facilities"" theory would not apply either. See MCI Communications Corp. v. AT&T Co., 708 F.2d 
1081, 1132 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 891 (1983) (plaintiff must show control of the essential facility by a monopolist). "
1468,1," The defendants will be referred to collectively as ""KGH"". "
1470,2," Although Quinn is the plaintiff, he submitted and relies on data from Dickinson's practice. He supports the use of this data by 
saying that, as President, he ""has a personal financial stake in the practice of each of the members of the Group. Hence, the 
interstate commerce inquiry is properly addressed by an examination of the entire Dickinson group."" Quinn's Brief in Support at 
8. Furthermore, the bylaw affected other members of Dickinson who were also denied full access to the hospital. Id.  Although 
Quinn's practice may have less of an effect on interstate commerce than Dickinson's in terms of amount of revenue or number of 
patients seen, the two practices are parallel in that actions taken by KGH that have a ""not insubstantial"" effect on Dickinson's 
practice also have a ""not insubstantial"" effect on Quinn's, and vice versa. Therefore, the Court considered the figures submitted 
about Dickinson."
1470,3," The Third Circuit authorized the Court to decide the interstate commerce issue by examining how KGH's conduct affects 
interstate commerce independently of Quinn.  Cardio-Medical Assocs., 721 F.2d at 75. The Court cannot do so in this case 
because Quinn has not demonstrated the interstate commerce effect of the bylaws independent of himself in practical economic 
terms. He has not submitted data concerning other physicians affected by the bylaw. Thus, the Court must examine how KGH's 
conduct affected interstate commerce through Quinn, that is, the nexus requirement."
1470,4," Quinn claims that the bylaw ""foreclos[ed] the use of these interstate drugs and equipment at the hospital."" Quinn's Brief in 
Support at 9. KGH correctly points out that these material could not be used in KGH even without the bylaw because KGH 
provides its own supplies. KGH's Brief in Opposition at 9. The data is still relevant, however, because use of out-of-state 
supplies on Dickinson's patients by Dickinson rather than by KGH at KGH represents an alteration of interstate commerce 
caused by the bylaw. "
1476,1," Technically, there is no ""violation"" of the Sherman Act if the defendant prevails on a business justification defense. See infra 
section IV. "
1477,2," Two Justices relied on Congress' silence as a justification for preserving the per se rule. See 466 U.S. at 32 (Brennan, J., 
concurring). Four Justices, recognizing that tying arrangements may have procompetitive effects, would analyze these 
arrangements under the Rule of Reason. See id. at 32-47 (O'Connor, J., concurring). Thoughtful antitrust scholars have 
expressed serious doubts about the alleged anticompetitive effects of tie-ins. See 5 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law 
paras. 1129c, 1134b (1980); R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 372-75 (1978); see also Hirsh v. Martindale-Hubbell, Inc., 674 F.2d 
1343, 1349 n.19 (9th Cir.) (criticizing reasons asserted in support of the antitrust law's harsh treatment of tying arrangements), 
cert. denied, 459 U.S. 973, 74 L. Ed. 2d 285, 103 S. Ct. 305 (1982). The close division on the rationale in Hyde was attributable 
in part to the debate over whether tying arrangements raise antitrust concerns."
1477,3," This so-called ""leverage theory"" has been criticized because modern economic thought seems to indicate that all available 
monopoly profits could be obtained from the tying product alone without the use of a tie-in. See R. Bork, supra, at 373. Tying 
arrangements are also viewed with disfavor because they can be used to facilitate price discrimination. Where the quantity of 
sales of the tied product measures the buyer's intensity of use of the tying product, the seller may be able to exact a premium 
from the more intensive users by charging above-cost prices for the tied product. There are no allegations that the tying 
arrangement here fosters price discrimination. "
1478,4," To the extent that the panel's opinion in Digidyne indicates that the presumption of market power is warranted merely by the 
existence of copyright protection, the Digidyne view has been rejected by several courts and commentators. See, e.g., A.I. Root 
Co. v. Computer/Dynamics, Inc., 806 F.2d 673, 676 (6th Cir. 1986); Will v. Comprehensive Accounting Corp., 776 F.2d 665, 673 
n.4 (7th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1129, 106 S. Ct. 1659, 90 L. Ed. 2d 201 (1986); Note, The Presumption of Economic 
Power for Patented and Copyrighted Products in Tying Arrangements, 85 Colum. L. Rev. 1140, 1156 (1985); see also Hyde, 466 
U.S. at 37 n.7 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (patent holder has no market power if there are close substitutes for the patented 
product). Two Justices who favor retention of the per se rule against tie-ins would have granted certiorari in Digidyne because of 
the panel's failure to engage in market analysis. See 473 U.S. 908, 105 S. Ct. 3534, 87 L. Ed. 2d 657 (1985) (White, J., joined 
by Blackmun, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). "
1480,5," It may seem somewhat anomalous to permit justifications for arrangements that are apparently subject to per se condemnation. 
However, HN6[
] per se rules are simply examples of presumptions that exist throughout antitrust law, and ""easy labels do not always supply ready answers."" Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting Sys., 441 U.S. 1, 8, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1, 99 S. Ct. 
1551 (1979). Before applying the per se label we must determine whether the challenged practice is one of those types that ""is 
'plainly anticompetitive' and very likely without 'redeeming virtue.'"" Id. at 9. Allowing the defendant to assert a business 
justification defense is one way of inquiring into whether the reasons for the relatively categorical historical condemnation of tie-
ins apply to the challenged arrangements. "
1481,6," The most notable exception to the general rejection of the quality control defense is United States v. Jerrold Electronics Corp., 
187 F. Supp. 545 (E.D. Pa. 1960), aff'd per curiam, 365 U.S. 567, 5 L. Ed. 2d 806, 81 S. Ct. 755 (1961). There the court held 
that Jerrold's requirement that buyers of its television system also purchase installation and repair service was necessary to 
protect Jerrold's business reputation.  Id. at 557-60. However, the court seemed to limit the defense to nascent firms entering a 
technologically complex industry.  Id. at 560. The quality control defense was also successful in Susser v. Carvel Corp., 332 F.2d 505 (2d Cir. 1964), cert. dismissed, 381 
U.S. 125, 14 L. Ed. 2d 284, 85 S. Ct. 1364 (1965). The Susser court held that the tie of ice cream purchases to a trademark 
license was legitimate because it would have been difficult to specify contractually the ""desired texture and taste of an ice cream 
cone or sundae."" Id. at 520."
1481,7," The instructions were as follows: If you find that the tying agreements in this case were unlawful either because they were per se violations of the Sherman 
Act or because they were unreasonable under the Rule of Reason test, you must then determine whether they were 
warranted by a business justification. The burden is on the defendant to demonstrate the existence of a business 
justification. And again, you will recall the burden of proof that I explained to you earlier, but for this purpose, that burden is 
upon the defendant. In considering the question of business justification, you must bear in mind that a tying agreement can be justified only if 
there is no less restrictive alternative. Even if some sort of regulation is reasonably necessary to promote the business of 
the parties, a less restrictive regulation must be adopted instead of a more restrictive one. No anticompetitive restraint is "
1482,," permissible which is broader or more onerous than reasonably necessary to achieve a goal even where the goal is 
legitimate. Defendant's claimed business justification is that the restraint protected the quality of the Mercedes automobile. In order to 
establish its business justification defense, defendant must show that the tying arrangement was necessary to protect the 
quality of the automobiles, and that replacement parts of appropriate quality are unavailable from sellers other than 
defendant itself. In other words, defendant cannot prevail on its business justification defense unless it has sustained its 
burden of proving that its tying arrangement is the only way the safety and quality of MB cars can be assured. R.T. of Oct. 18, 1985, at 40-41. "
1504,1," Apparently, there is another entity on this corporate ladder. For purposes of these motions, however, the simplified structure set 
forth above will suffice. "
1505,2," In its complaint, plaintiff DAISA listed over 200 copyright registrations that it allegedly owned. Subsequent to discovery, plaintiff 
reduced this list to include only the thirty-one items it believed defendants were actually selling. See Order dated September 12, 
1984 (granting plaintiff's motion to dismiss without prejudice its complaint as to alleged copyright infringement of certain 
registered works). "
1506,3," Section 405(a)(1) is clearly inapplicable. DAISA's chief executive officer estimated that at the time the omission was 
discovered, about 150,000 pieces were in the warehouse, see Plaintiffs' Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary 
Judgment, Exhibit 7 (Oltra Deposition) at 171, and these were apparently distributed without notice. Defendants also suggest 
that ""Weil and its retailers in the United States undoubtedly also had thousands of unmarked figurines on hand."" Defendants' 
Memorandum at 6 n.1. Neither side has indicated how many copies were distributed before the omission was discovered, but 
there has been no assertion that the number was relatively small. There is also no assertion by the parties that § 405(a)(3) is 
applicable. "
1507,4, See note 8 infra.
1507,5," While the decision in Kramer might, at first glance, seem to provide support for plaintiff's position, it is clearly distinguishable. In 
Kramer, the manufacturer of a computer video game discovered that its notice did not comply with the statutory requirements 
and was therefore defective. The manufacturer immediately added proper notice to every game manufactured and sold 
thereafter.  783 F.2d at 431 & 444. The district court, however, found that the manufacturer had forfeited its copyright because it 
had made no effort to add proper notice to games in its regional warehouses or in the possession of its distributors and because 
it had not sent out replacement programs to consumers who had already purchased the games. Id. In reversing the district 
court's finding, the Fourth Circuit noted first that the manufacturer had no obligation under the statute to send out replacement 
programs because those games had already been distributed to the public.  Id.  at 444. Next, the court noted that while a "
1508,," copyright owner must add notice to games that are in storage or that have been distributed to retail dealers but not yet to the 
public, the manufacturer's effort to do so need only be a reasonable one. Id. (citations omitted). The court in Kramer found that 
the manufacturer's effort was reasonable because, inter alia, the manufacturer had responded to its error promptly and because 
only three or four games that had been sold prior to the discovery of the defective notice were actually delivered after the 
discovery. Id. While it is not clear from the opinion, a fair reading indicates that these three or four games had already been sold 
as part of a lot sale and were in storage only because the manufacturer was awaiting payment. Id. Furthermore, the Fourth 
Circuit determined that the district court's finding that the manufacturer had failed to add proper notice to games in the hands of 
its distributors was erroneous because the manufacturer had no retail distributors; rather, it sold directly to the public. Id. Therefore, while it is possible to read the decision in Kramer as excusing delivery without proper notice after a defect or omission 
in notice is discovered, a more accurate reading is that the Fourth Circuit excused the delivery without proper notice of only a 
very small number of games and it did so because the manufacturer's efforts to comply with proper notice requirements, viewed 
as a whole, were more than reasonable.  Based upon the facts of the case and the Fourth Circuit's discussion, the decision 
provides no support for concluding that a prospective cure, by itself, satisfies the requirements of section 405(a)(2). In contrast to the facts of Kramer, plaintiffs in this case concede that a large number of unmarked figurines were in inventory at 
the time that omission of the required notice was discovered and that these pieces were subsequently distributed without notice, 
although the record admittedly does not indicate how many of these were distributed in the U.S.  Furthermore, these pieces had 
no notice, whereas in Kramer, the games seem to have had at least defective notice. While the court in Kramer did not mention 
this latter point as a basis for reversal of the district court, this point was mentioned by the Second Circuit in Shapiro when it 
distinguished a case the district court had found persuasive.  Shapiro, 764 F.2d at 75 (distinguishing Beacon Looms, Inc. v. S. 
Lichtenberg & Co., 552 F. Supp. 1305 (S.D.N.Y. 1982), in which no notice had been affixed, and noting that at least ""some form 
of notice, albeit defective, had been included, so that a purchaser would be aware that some proprietary claim was being 
asserted"")."
1508,6," While the court in Animal Fair thus excused the omission of notice on sewn-in labels of those slippers already shipped to 
retailers, that decision does not seem to support a finding that a prospective cure is sufficient. First, while the opinion is not clear 
on this point, it appears that the manufacturer had re-labeled those copies still in its possession.  620 F. Supp. at 179. Second, 
while the court declined to reach the question of whether the notice on the hangtags was affixed within the meaning of 17 U.S.C. 
§ 401, id., and thus did not consider this factor in its decision on whether the manufacturer had sufficiently complied with the 
notice requirements of the Copyright Act, it nonetheless seems clear that this factor had a bearing on the court's determination 
that the manufacturer's omission did not invalidate the copyright. Cf. id. at n.15 (""The court would simply note that there is no 
doubt in this case that the copyright notice on the hangtag was prominent to anyone purchasing or inspecting the product . . . .""). "
1509,7, See note 8 infra.
1509,8," Plaintiff asserts that it rejected the use of adhesive labels because of its knowledge that such labels are not permanent; 
therefore, it believed that this method would not have been acceptable. See Plaintiffs' Opposition at 13. However, defendants 
correctly argue that the applicable regulations promulgated under section 401(c) do not require that notice be physically 
incorporated in the work or permanently attached. Rather, two of the alternative examples of acceptable methods of affixation 
include use of a label that is ""cemented, sewn, or otherwise attached durably, so as to withstand normal use,"" 37 C.F.R. § 
201.20(i)(2) (emphasis added), or the use of a tag that is ""of durable material, so as to withstand normal use, and that is 
attached to the copy with sufficient durability that it will remain with the copy while it is passing through the normal channels of 
commerce,"" id. at (i)(3) (emphasis added). Therefore, plaintiffs' excuse for rejecting the use of adhesive labels is inadequate 
under the regulations relating to affixation of notice. While these regulations do not address efforts to cure omissions, there is no reason to assume that an acceptable method under 
section 401(c) would not be acceptable under section 405(a). Several courts, for instance, have found that the use of stickers or 
removable pressure-sensitive labels can constitute a reasonable effort to add notice and thus cure an omission or can at least 
raise sufficient factual questions to withstand a motion for summary judgment or support a motion for a preliminary injunction. 
See, e.g., Innovative Concepts in Entertainment, 576 F. Supp. at 460; Beacon Looms, Inc. v. S. Lichtenberg & Co., Inc., 552 F.

213 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 808, 811 (N.D. Ill.  May 11, 1981); P. Kaufman, Inc. v. Rex Curtain Corp., 203 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 859 859 
(S.D.N.Y. June 14, 1978). Furthermore, plaintiff's concern that the labels would be unacceptable under the copyright statute 
because they could be removed by potential infringers, see Plaintiffs' Opposition, Exhibit 7 (Oltra Deposition) at 169 & 191, is 
unfounded. Section 405(c) HN7[
] specifically provides that ""protection under this title is not affected by the removal, 
destruction, or obliteration of the notice, without the authorization of the copyright owner, from any publicly distributed copies. . . 
."" Plaintiff's argument with respect to the unreasonableness of unpacking the figurines from their carefully-sealed boxes is also 
unavailing. First, the mere fact that added expense is involved does not relieve plaintiff of its burden under section 405(a)(2). 
See Videotronics, 586 F. Supp. at 483 HN8[
] (""Implicit in the concept of a 'reasonable effort' under § 405(a)(2) is the expectation that an expenditure of time and money over and above that required in the normal course of business will be 
made.""). Plaintiff has made no showing that its expenses as to the boxes would have been unreasonable within the meaning of 
section 405(a)(2). Second, even if plaintiff had shown that unpacking and repacking would have been unreasonable, it has failed 
to show any effort to use reasonable alternatives. For instance, plaintiff could have avoided destroying the boxes by adding 
labels to those boxes in inventory and mailing labels to its distributors with instructions to affix them to the figurines or boxes.  
Such an effort might ultimately have been deemed reasonable under the circumstances. Cf.  Beacon Looms, 552 F. Supp. at 
1313; Florists' Transworld, 213 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) at 811; P. Kaufman, 203 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) at 860. Finally, plaintiff alleges in its 
memorandum that ""unpacking and repacking the pieces could have resulted in a not insignificant percentage of breakage."" 
Plaintiffs' Opposition at 13. This statement is based on the testimony of Mr. Oltra. However, a review of Mr. Oltra's testimony 
reveals that the significant amount of breakage he was referring to was related to the idea of re-baking the pieces. Id. Exhibit 7 
(Oltra Deposition) at 170.  In terms of unpacking and re-packing, he testified merely that ""there is possible breakage upon taking 
[the figurines] out of the box[es],"" id. (emphasis added), and that upon opening the boxes, ""there could be breakage,"" id. at 171 
(emphasis added). The mere possibility of some unspecified amount of breakage cannot excuse plaintiff from at least making an 
effort, particularly when there were apparently reasonable alternatives that could have been attempted. "
1510,," Plaintiff also asserts that any attempt to add notice to pieces already shipped to defendant Weil and to U.S. retail stores would 
have been unreasonable. Plaintiffs' Opposition at 14. The Second Circuit has determined that HN9[
] the addition of notice to 
copies shipped to distributors and retailers but not yet distributed to the public is not a statutory requirement but is, rather, just 
one relevant factor to be considered in determining whether a copyright owner has made reasonable efforts to cure and 
omission. See Shapiro, 764 F.2d at 75 (citation omitted). While the Second Circuit in Shapiro held that the question is one of 
fact, that decision, which was premised on very different facts, does not preclude summary judgment in this case. In Shapiro, the plaintiff had alleged that efforts to cure its defective notice on copies to its retailers would have been unavailing.  
Id. at 74-75. Furthermore, as discussed above, the plaintiff in Shapiro had included some form of notice, albeit defective, and 
had re-labeled those copies still in its possession. Thus, some effort had been made and the question became whether, taken as 
a whole, that effort was reasonable. See id. at 75. Here, plaintiff has made no proper effort to cure its omission other than to add proper notice to copies manufactured after 
discovery of the omission. As discussed previously with respect to its inventory, plaintiff DAISA could have at least attempted to 
cure its omission by mailing labels or tags to its distributor and the U.S. retail outlets. Unlike the plaintiff in Shapiro, plaintiff here 
has failed to establish that any attempts to add notice to products already shipped would have been unreasonable or unavailing. 
See id. at 75; see also Lifshitz v. Walter Drake & Sons, Inc., 806 F.2d 1426, 1434 (9th Cir. 1986) (in finding plaintiff's copyright 
invalid because, inter alia, plaintiff made no attempt to add proper notice to copies shipped to its distributor, court noted that 
while ""it is certainly possible that [the distributor], and independent entity, would have declined to cooperate with [the plaintiff 
manufacturer] in his efforts to add proper copyright notice to these copies,"" HN10[
] the statute requires only that the plaintiff 
make a reasonable effort, no that he succeed). "
1512,9," Section 1114(1)(a) HN15[
] provides that: (1) Any person who shall, without the consent of the registrant - "
1513,," (a) use in commerce any reproduction, counterfeit, copy or colorable imitation of a registered mark in connection with the 
sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely 
to cause confusion, or to cause a mistake, or to deceive . . . shall be liable in a civil action by the registrant . . . . As a preliminary matter, the Court notes that ownership of the mark is not contested in this motion, see Defendants' 
Memorandum at 14 n.3, although the issue had been raised by defendants in their opposition to plaintiff's original motion for 
summary judgment. Because the validity of the mark is not being challenged, the Court merely notes that registration of the 
trademark is prima facie evidence of its validity and of the holder's exclusive right to use it.  Original Appalachian Artworks, Inc. 
v. Granada Electronics, Inc., 816 F.2d 68, 71 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 847, 56 U.S.L.W. 3244, 98 L. Ed. 2d 99, 108 S. 
Ct. 143 (1987)."
1513,10," Interestingly, in Weil Ceramics, involving the same issues and the same plaintiff but different defendants, the defendants 
conceded that they had used the mark in U.S. commerce without Weil's consent.  618 F. Supp. at 704."
1513,11," The Court is cognizant of plaintiffs' objection to the term ""Lladro Group,"" and recognizes that there is no entity with that name. 
Not seeing any ""sinister"" connotation in it, the Court uses the term merely for convenience."
1513,12, See discussion infra with respect to whether the goods are identical. 
1515,13," While the parties dispute whether Weil is ""controlled"" by the ""Lladro Group,"" compare Plaintiff's Opposition at 64-66 with 
Defendants' Reply at 3-5, there is no dispute that Lladro Exportadora, S.A., which owns 100% of Weil, and Lladro, S.A., the 
manufacturer of Lladro porcelain, are commonly owned by the same corporate parent, Sodigei, S.A., a Spanish corporation. See 
Plaintiff's Opposition at 33 & 64; Memorandum and Order dated Feb. 18, 1986 (Mag. Scheindlin) at 2; text accompanying note 1 
supra. "
1516,14," Because of the result reached under the authority of Olympus, it is unnecessary to address the other arguments raised by the 
parties. The Court notes, however, that the parties have provided no support for their arguments with respect to whether section 
1124 provides a cause of action against distributors as well as importers. "
1517,15," Defendants submitted a July 30, 1976 Memorandum from the U.S.  Customs Service finding that the Lladro trademark was 
owned by a foreign corporation by virtue of Weil's assignment to Lladro, S.A. and concluding that merchandise bearing the 
Lladro mark could therefore be imported by anyone. See Counterplaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment on the Antitrust 
Counterclaim, Exhibit 4. Presumably, plaintiff's 1984 recording would reflect Lladro's assignment back to Weil and would indicate 
that Weil is the U.S. trademark owner."
1517,16," Defendants filed an answer and counterclaim to DAISA's copyright complaint on Dec. 14, 1983 and an answer and 
counterclaim to Weil's trademark complaint on May 25, 1984. The counterclaims are virtually identical. Paragraph 19 of the 
counterclaims was amended on March 4, 1985. "
1520,17," Similarly, to obtain relief under sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act for the alleged violations of section 2 of the Sherman Act, 
Karen-Leslie must have suffered or be threatened with suffering an antitrust injury. See, e.g., Catlin v. Washington Energy Co., 
791 F.2d 1343, 1347 (9th Cir. 1986); Garshman v. Universal Resources Holding, Inc., 625 F. Supp. 737, 745 (D.N.J. 1986), aff'd, 
824 F.2d 223 (3d Cir. 1987). Because of the Court's conclusion with respect to the inappropriateness of discussing the merits of 
the section 2 claims, see discussion infra, the Court will not reach the issues of injury and standing on these claims at this time. 
Upon a renewed motion for summary judgment, if any is made, the parties are reminded that these issues are critical."
1520,18," While the doctrines of antitrust injury and antitrust standing are often confused, they involve distinct inquiries as to the scope of 
liability under the antitrust laws. See, e.g., Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 728 n.7, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707, 97 S. Ct. 2061 
(1977); Page, ""The Scope of Liability for Antitrust Violations,"" 37 Stan. L. Rev. 1445, 1484 (1985). Nonetheless, the policies 
behind both doctrines are related. See id. at 1484 & 1511-12. As the Second Circuit has stated, ""both concepts . . . share a 
common ingredient, 'confin[ing] recovery to those who have been injured by restraint on competitive forces in the economy.'"" 
Triple M Roofing Corp. v. Tremco, Inc. 753 F.2d 242, 247 (2d Cir. 1985) (quoting GAF Corp. v. Circle Floor Co., 463 F.2d 752, 
758 (2d Cir. 1972)). The parties to this suit have displayed a certain amount of confusion in their analyses of these issues, which is understandable 
given the confusion shown by the courts. To simplify matters, the Court will adopt the suggestion of Professor Page and focus 
on antitrust injury first, see Page, supra, at 1484, especially as the injury analysis forms a necessary part of the standing 
analysis, see, e.g., Associated General Contractors of California, Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 74 
L. Ed. 2d 723, 103 S. Ct. 897 (1983). "
1521,19," Karen-Leslie's complaint and memorandum in opposition to counterdefendants' motion do not provide much guidance for the 
Court as to whether the alleged boycott/refusal to deal is horizontal or vertical.  Because its allegations with respect to the 
existence of a horizontal conspiracy relate only to the alleged price-fixing scheme and because the record does not provide 
sufficient support to conclude that there was a horizontal group boycott, the Court will focus on the theory that the allegedly 
illegal boycott or refusal to deal was vertical. Cf.  Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 588, 89 
L. Ed. 2d 538, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986) (""antitrust law limits the range of permissible inferences from ambiguous evidence in a § 
1 case""). This conclusion is particularly warranted in light of the Supreme Court's admonition in Matsushita ""that HN39[
] if the 
factual context renders the [plaintiff's] claim implausible -- if the claim is one that simply makes no economic sense -- [the 
plaintiff] must come forward with more persuasive evidence to support [its] claim than would otherwise be necessary."" Id. at 587. 
In this case, a horizontal boycott makes little economic sense, at least in terms of those retailers that had previously sold Karen-
Leslie their overstock. Those retailers presumably would have little incentive to boycott a longstanding customer. Furthermore, 
there would appear to be no motive for the other retailers that were not Karen-Leslie's suppliers to institute a boycott of Karen-
Leslie because Karen-Leslie is not a competitor and is thus not threatening them with price competition. Therefore, it appears 
that the only refusal to deal that makes economic sense is a vertical one, instituted and enforced, if at all, by Weil."
1521,20," At oral argument on October 11, 1985, Karen-Leslie conceded that the relevant time period for the purpose of its counterclaim 
was 1978-1981, the period during which the authorized retailers refused to sell Lladro to Karen-Leslie and during which Karen-
Leslie had no other available source.  From 1981 to the present, Karen-Leslie has been purchasing Lladro from an independent 
source. See Counterplaintiff's Memorandum, Exhibit R. At the hearing, Karen-Leslie did not argue that it was injured during this 
latter period and the Court sees nothing in the record to so indicate. Cf.  Original Appalachian Artworks Inc. v. Granada 
Electronics, 229 U.S.P.Q.  (BNA) 54, 58 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 20, 1986) (citation omitted) (finding that gray goods importers benefit 
from any anticompetitive conduct of trademark holder because inflated price of domestic products makes it economically feasible 
for gray marketer to purchase products in Europe and import them into U.S.), aff'd, 816 F.2d 68 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 
847, 56 U.S.L.W. 3244, 98 L. Ed. 2d 99, 108 S. Ct. 143 (1987). Accordingly, this opinion will be confined to the injury alleged to 
have been suffered from 1978-1981. "
1522,21," The circumstantial evidence of a price-fixing conspiracy is not necessary to establish the existence of a concerted refusal to 
deal in this case because there is direct evidence of an agreement between Weil and the dealers that the dealers would not sell 
to anyone but consumers. Karen-Leslie's argument that ""[a] finding that non-price restrictions are part of a price-fixing conspiracy suffices to subject the 
entire conspiracy to per se treatment,"" Counterplaintiff's Memorandum at 26 & 30 (citing Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service 
Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 760 n.6, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775, 104 S. Ct. 1464 (1984)), is not relevant to the injury inquiry before this Court. As 
the Court explained in Matsushita, ""however one decides to describe the contours of [an] asserted conspiracy,"" an antitrust 
plaintiff ""must show that the conspiracy caused [it] an injury for which the antitrust laws provide relief."" 475 U.S. at 584 n. 7 
(citations omitted). Because most of the allegedly illegal behavior -- whether described as one overall conspiracy or as several -- 
set forth in Matsushita involved behavior that although violative of the antitrust laws would not have harmed the plaintiffs, the 
Court concluded that the required showing depended on proof that the defendants had conspired to price predatorily in the 
American market.  Id. at 586. Only this conduct, as opposed to the other kinds of illegal conduct alleged by the plaintiffs, would 
have injured the plaintiffs. Id. In Matsushita, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had engaged, inter alia, in a conspiracy to fix prices, a conspiracy to 
impose nonprice restraints that allegedly effected market prices or limited output, and a conspiracy to monopolize by predatorily 
pricing.  Id. at 582-83. The plaintiffs argued that the first two conspiracies, which were found not to have caused them injury, 
should be viewed as circumstantial evidence of the third conspiracy, which had caused injury. Id. at 5d4. The Court determined 
that evidence of the first two conspiracies would defeat the defendants' motion for summary judgment only if it raised a genuine 
issue of fact with respect to the existence of the only conspiracy that could have injured the plaintiffs.  475 U.S. at 586. As in Matsushita, the price-fixing conspiracy alleged here could not have harmed Karen-Leslie; thus, Karen-Leslie has no 
cognizable price-fixing claim and its attempt to rely on the Monsanto per se standard to circumvent the injury requirement of 
Brunswick and other relevant cases must fail. Cf.  Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 584-85 n. 8."
1522,22," The Court will not address at this time Karen-Leslie's ultimate ability to show damages. See, e.g., Beach v. Viking Sewing 
Machine Co., 784 F.2d 746, 752 (6th Cir. 1986) (finding plaintiff's proof of damages stemming from inability to acquire desired 
dealership insufficient where plaintiff failed to demonstrate that defendant's product was unique and that comparable alternative 
brands were unavailable)."
1522,23, The parties agree that Karen-Leslie and Weil are competitors at the wholesale level. 
1523,24," One court has opined, for instance, that a decision with respect to antitrust injury cannot be made in most cases until after trial. 
See Haff v. Jewelmont Corp., 594 F. Supp. 1468, 1472 n.2 (N.D. Cal. 1984). While this Court does not find the reasoning of the 
Haff court fully persuasive, it nevertheless finds that a resolution of the issue at this time is not essential for the reason set forth 
in the text following this footnote."
1523,25," The inquiry as to whether a damages claim is highly speculative is distinct from the issue of whether a plaintiff can prove its 
damages.  Reliance on a highly speculative theory would probably bar standing. See, e.g., McCready, 457 U.S. at 475 n.11 
(noting cautious approach when damages theory is ""speculative, abstract, or impractical""). In contract, reliance on a theory that 
is not speculative but is somewhat difficult to prove does not bar standing so long as injury to business or property is shown. 
See, e.g., Jayco Systems, Inc. v. Savin Business Machines Corp., 777 F.2d 306, 314 n. 21 (5th Cir. 1985) (citations omitted), 
cert. denied, 479 U.S. 816, 107 S. Ct. 73, 93 L. Ed. 2d 30 (1986). Thus, Karen-Leslie's ability to prove its damages, see note 24 
supra, is not of concern under this analysis, except to show that its claim is not highly speculative. "
1524,26," Karen-Leslie has failed to address adequately any issues relevant to the standing analysis required by section 16 of the 
Clayton Act. Instead, it relies primarily on the argument that because it has standing under section 4 and because the standing 
requirements under section 16 are less stringent than those under section 4, it therefore has standing under section 16. This 
argument is inadequate as noted in the text. "
1525,27," Counterdefendants' argument that because Lladro, S.A., DAISA, and Weil are related entities, they are incapable as a matter 
of law of conspiring with each other within the meaning of section 1 of the Sherman Act is, of course, true. See Copperweld 
Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984). Karen-Leslie has not contested 
counterdefendants' argument that counterdefendants could not, as a matter of law, have conspired with Weil's sales 
representatives. See Counterplaintiff's Memorandum at 6 n. 3. Because a discussion of this issue is not necessary for a 
resolution of this motion, the Court will not address this argument."
1525,28," Karen-Leslie's allegations with respect to the existence of a horizontal conspiracy relate only to the alleged price-fixing scheme 
and thus will not be addressed. See note 21 supra."
1525,29," The letter agreement reads as follows: Dear Customer: We are sure you share our pride in the excellence of our LLADRO line. To maintain that excellence, it is essential that we know who our customers are and what they do with our merchandise 
from the time we ship it to the time of its retail sale. For that reason, we ask that you acknowledge, by signing and returning 
the duplicate copy, your agreement that all LLADRO merchandise we ship to you must be sold by you only at retail and 
only at a location to which we ship it, or to which we otherwise specifically agree and not sold to anyone else or transferred 
to any other location for resale. We appreciate your cooperation. Very truly yours, "
1526,," WEIL CERAMICS & GLASS, INC. Counterdefendants' Memorandum, Exhibit G."
1526,30," Counterdefendants strenuously argue that the customer restriction clause is reasonable and should be upheld by this Court. 
They assert that the sole purpose for it is to ensure that Lladro, a high-quality item, will be sold from locations meeting the 
standards of Weil. See, e.g., Counterdefendants' Reply at 14. Specifically, counterdefendants assert that the primary reason for Weil's restrictions is that Weil wants only retail stores having an image compatible with Lladro brand 
giftware to sell the Lladro brand products supplied by Weil. Weil is very concerned with the reputation of its Lladro 
trademark, and sells its products only to those retail stores which it believes will support and add to the reputation, rather 
than detract from it. . . . . The customer limitation . . . is intended to prevent a retail store, which meets Weil's standards, from selling the products 
purchased from Weil at wholesale to another retailer or a middleman for eventual sale from a location which may detract 
from the Lladro image. If the image and reputation of the Lladro name is tarnished, then Lladro brand products will not be 
able to compete as well with the dozens of others [Sic] products competing with the Lladro brand. The purpose of the . . . 
customer restriction is, therefore, to maintain the reputation of the Lladro line of giftware, so that its competitive position vis-
a-vis other brands may be maintained. Id. at 14-15. Customer restrictions such as this must be evaluated under the rule of reason, see Sylvania, 433 U.S. at 57-59; see also id. at 
46, and for the reasons discussed previously, the Court is unable to make such a determination on the record before it. See, 
e.g., W. H. Brady Co. v. Lem Products, Inc., 659 F. Supp. 1355, 1379 (N.D. Ill. 1987) (""As in all rule of reason analyses, in order 
to establish that a customer assignment is unreasonable, a plaintiff must first prove that the supplier had significant market 
power . . . ."") (citing Morrison v. Murray Biscuit Co., 797 F.2d 1430, 1435 (7th Cir. 1986)). "
1527,31," In reaching this conclusion, the Second Circuit explained: HN48[
] Horizontal restraints alone have been characterized as ""naked restraints of trade with no purpose except stifling 
competition,"" White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 263, 83 S. Ct. 696, 702, 9 L. Ed. 2d 738 (1963); and, 
therefore, per se violations of the Sherman Act. On the other hand, while vertical restrictions may reduce intrabrand 
competition by limiting the number of sellers of a particular product, competing for a given group of buyers, they also 
promote interbrand competition by allowing a manufacturer to achieve certain efficiencies in the distribution of its products, 
see Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., supra, 433 U.S.  at 54, 97 S. Ct. 2549. They are, therefore, to be examined 
under the rule of reason standard. See Handler, Changing Trends in Antitrust Doctrines: An Unprecedented Supreme Court 
Term - 1977, 77 Colum.L.Rev. 979 at 985-87 (1977). Oreck, 579 F.2d at 131."
1527,32, See note 23 supra. 
1528,33," The Supreme Court has determined that ""'proof of actual detrimental effects, such as a reduction of output' can obviate the 
need for an inquiry into market power, which is but a 'surrogate for detrimental effects.'"" FTC v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, 
476 U.S. 447, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 2019, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1986) (quoting 7 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law § 1511, at 429 (1986)). 
There is no showing in this case of ""actual, sustained adverse effects on competition,"" id.; thus, this alternative to an elaborate 
market analysis is not available."
1528,34," The Court notes that in addition to the question of the impact on competition in the relevant market, there is also a question as 
to whether alternative sources of supply were available or whether Karen-Leslie was in fact excluded from competition in the 
relevant market as a whole. See, e.g., Oreck, 579 F.2d at 128-29; Schwartz v. Jamesway Corp., 660 F. Supp. 138, 141 
(E.D.N.Y. 1987). The availability to Karen-Leslie of alternative brands that compete in the same market as Lladro porcelain and 
that are reasonably interchangeable would certainly weaken, if not destroy, Karen-Leslie's argument that it was excluded from 
the relevant market. See, e.g., Oreck, 579 F.2d at 128-29. Because the parties have not even satisfied the Court with respect to 
the required threshold showing of the impact on the relevant market, the Court need not address the issue of alternative 
sources."
1528,35," Section 2 of the Sherman Act HN53[
] provides in relevant part that Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States . . . shall be deemed guilty . . . ."
1528,15, U.S.C. § 2. 
1529,36," Because this threshhold issue has not been resolved, the Court will not address the other factors that must be considered in 
determining whether counterdefendants have monopoly power or a dangerous probability of acquiring monopoly power. See 
International Distribution Centers, 812 F.2d at 792 (other market characteristics that must be considered in addition to market 
share are strength of competition, probable development of the industry, barriers to entry, nature of asserted anticompetitive 
conduct, and elasticity of consumer demand) (citations omitted)."
1529,37," While Karen-Leslie has not indicated that the specified activities discussed in the text fall within the prohibition of section 2 of 
the Sherman Act, the Court presumes that Karen-Leslie meant to so indicate as there is no allegation of ""agreement,"" which 
would be a necessary prerequisite for a section 1 claim. "
1531,38," Karen-Leslie attempts to characterize this Court's previous ruling on counterdefendants' motion to dismiss as a rejection of 
counterdefendants' Noerr-Pennington arguments. Counterplaintiff's Memorandum at 39 n. 12. This assertion is without merit. At 
the April 6, 1984 oral hearing on counterdefendants' motion to dismiss, this Court merely held that taking the allegations of the 
complaint as true, Karen-Leslie's complaint was sufficient to withstand the motion. That ruling was not dispositive with respect to 
the merits of counterdefendants' claim of immunity. "

1561,12," A closure seal is a band placed over the top of a soft pack of cigarettes for the purpose of holding the pack together after it is 
opened. "
1564,13," Liggett has requested leave to amend its complaint to challenge an oval design used for a number of months by B&W on its 
Filter Cigarettes packages. For reasons discussed in this opinion, the Court should deny leave to amend the complaint at this 
late date. "
1568,14," These lines of evidence deal principally with showings that consumers submitted B&W's superior tobacco closure seals to 
Liggett during a Liggett promotion that called for return of Liggett's Quality Seal, and consumer correspondence and telephone 
calls to Liggett that were misdirected as a result of apparent confusion between Liggett's and B&W's closure seals. "
1569,15," In November 1985, B&W discontinued use of the oval design. B&W states that this change was for business reasons 
unrelated to this litigation. "
1570,16," Liggett argues that it has always believed that its challenge to B&W's oval design was within the scope of the original 
pleadings. The Court finds no reasonable basis for that belief."
1570,17," In its reply brief, Liggett advises that it would prefer to withdraw its motion for leave to amend rather than delay the scheduling 
of this action for trial. "
1574,18," Mr. Reynolds' credentials as an expert in the field of cigarette products are set forth in paras. 1-4 of his affidavit. The Court 
finds that Mr. Reynolds is qualified to express an opinion concerning the effect of physical differences between cigarettes upon 
consumer preferences and perceptions."
1574,19," ""Tar"" is a shorthand term of a complex blend of chemicals produced when tobacco is burned. (Reynolds Affidavit, para. 15.) "
1575,20," Reynolds states that ""[i]f two cigarettes are identical except for their length, the longer cigarette will be perceived as tasting 
milder and less strong."" (Reynolds Affidavit, para. 35.) "
1576,21," Liggett does dispute the propriety of comparing branded and generic cigarettes only within, and not across, tar categories. The 
Court discusses that matter subsequently in the text of the opinion."
1576,22," Instead, Liggett offers, out of context, a statement of Reynolds that ""[r]elative tar deliveries have nothing to do with this 
litigation."" (Reynolds' deposition, p. 205.)"
1576,23," Liggett contends that Reynolds' testimony should be discounted because he ""misled"" the Court in earlier proceedings. The 
Court does not find that it was misled or that such an allegation by Liggett forms a basis for discounting Reynolds' testimony at 
this time."
1576,24," Liggett cites sparse authority for its proposition that B&W's branded and generic cigarettes must be seen as of ""like grade and 
quality."" Liggett relies only on In re General Foods Corp., 52 F.T.C. 798 (1956), where the respondent represented that two 
different types of coffee were both ""Maxwell House. Here, B&W did not represent that its generic and branded cigarettes were "
1577,," the same product. If characterizing cheaper goods as of equal ""quality"" with tire expensive ones were sufficient to support a 
finding of ""like grade and quality"" under § 2(a) of the Act, that element of the Act would have very little meaning. "
1578,25, The price difference offered by B&W to certain customers took the form of rebates tied to volume. 
1580,26," The Court recognizes all three of the economists whose testimony is discussed above (Keller, Burnett, and Weil) as experts 
whose opinions may be helpful to the trier of fact. Their opinions constitute competent evidence. "
1582,27," Hogeland Exhibit 48 is a 156 page B&W document entitled ""Domestic Competitive Analysis-May 1984 Update."" "
1583,28," B&W disputes that this document is indicative of its entry intentions. B&W states that events which occurred after this 
document was drafted altered its plans. "
1585,29," Liggett contends that several of B&W's 1985 documents confirm B&W's alleged strategy. In January 1985, B&W's corporate 
parents noted that It was agreed that the price of generics should be increased as soon as possible. B&W should be prepared to take the lead on 
this, while still retaining flexibility to discount the net prices if it became necessary to do so. A key condition for continuing to 
market generics was that B&W should be in a position to establish price leadership. (Hogeland Exhibit 66, at 153899.) In March 1985, B&W's senior management responded to the above-cited statement by its 
corporate parent: "
1586,," Brown & Williamson agrees with the C.P.C. viewpoint and would like to initiate a price increase as soon as we possibly can. The 
key element in leading the price increase, in B&W's judgment, is market strength. We believe that we will achieve that strength 
when we are confident that we are tracking toward the 8.6 billion target. Brown & Williamson should be in a leadership position 
from that point forward. (Hogeland Exhibit 67 at 085712.) "
1590,30," ""Oligopoly"" is a neutral term insofar as antitrust law is concerned. There is nothing illegal about an oligopoly. "
1591,31," One of B&W's expert economists, Professor Elzinga, stated upon deposition that the existence of supracompetitive profits in 
the price of branded cigarettes is ""a complex issue"" and he had not made a determination on the matter. (Elzinga Deposition, pp. 
281-82.)"
1591,32," Harold A. Grant, Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing is the second Liggett executive whose testimony is said to 
conflict with Burnett's opinion testimony that supracompetitive profits are available in the cigarette industry. For the sake of 
simplicity, only Dey's deposition testimony and subsequent affidavit are discussed in the text of this opinion. Grant's testimony 
and later affidavit are to similar effect. "
1594,33," Liggett's witness Burnett predicted that Liggett's executives would describe competition in the cigarette industry as 
competitive, from a businessman's prospective. (Burnett Deposition, p. 106; Hogeland Exhibit 163.) Burnett also stated ""the 
difference that arises frequently in talking with businessmen is that economists and businessmen use terms in different ways."" 
(Id.) Professor Mills, a B&W expert, recognized that ""tacit collusion"" is a confusing term. (Mills' Deposition, pp. 54-55.)"
1594,34," B&W argues that the Dey and Grant affidavits should be disregarded as untimely filed. Since, in the Court's view, they do not 
affect the outcome of the dispute before the Court, the Court will, in its discretion, decline to strike the affidavits. "
1596,35," See Hogeland Exhibits 2 and 4 which are B&W documents that tend to show that limited resources were available for the 
effort to displace Liggett as the trade source of generic cigarettes. "
1598,36," B&W's third counterclaim is apparently intended to encompass claims of both antitrust injury and product disparagement. This 
section deals with the antitrust aspect of the counterclaim, and the next section of this opinion relates to the claim insofar as it is 
grounded upon alleged disparagement. "
1603,37," For examples of GPC's advisements to Liggett concerning these allowances, see Grant Exhibit 13 (""We plan, with your 
approval to give all major customers the $ 1.02 merchandising/advertising allowance""); Glover Exhibit 11; and Poole Exhibit 24. "
1604,38," B&W's claim of product disparagement is said to be based upon N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-1.1 as well as the common law of North 
Carolina. The product disparagement portion of B&W's § 75-1.1 claim should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction for reasons 
appearing in Part IX.B. of this opinion. "
1605,39," Additionally, B&W's counterclaims inject an issue that Liggett has used this litigation for improper purposes in the marketplace. 
In North Carolina Electric Membership Corp. v. Carolina Power & Light Co., 85 F.R.D. 249 (M.D.N.C. 1979), United States 
District Judge Eugene A. Gordon discussed the risk of allowing an antitrust defendant to litigate in the principal action a 
counterclaim that calls into question the plaintiff's motives in pursuing litigation. Judge Gordon wrote: Plaintiff's motive in filing an antitrust action has absolutely no relevance to the existence of liability of the defendant, but if [the 
plaintiff's] motives were as [the defendant] claims, and if [the defendant] were allowed to introduce evidence of an improper 
motive during the trial of the antitrust claims, it would have great prejudicial impact in the minds of a jury. Should the jury base a 
verdict for [the defendant] on that ground, it would pervert the Congressional purpose behind the antitrust laws. Id. at 254 n.7. "
1606,40," B&W argues that judicial economy requires trial of its claims in this forum since discovery has been completed. The Court 
finds, however, that the discovery involved herein will undoubtedly greatly shorten pretrial proceedings in any state court action 
on B&W's claims. See Metzger, 680 F.2d at 774. "
1608,41," Of interest on this point is the comment in North Carolina Electric to the effect that ""counsel . . . opined that this Court's ruling 
on the res judicata question would be the law of the case and thus would bind a state court judge should the issue arise at a 
later date for some reason. The Court of course makes no ruling on that question but it could seen to be a logical position to 
take, as well as a fair one."" 85 F.R.D. at 253 n.3. "
1617,1," FMC complains that some findings and conclusions were very like those proposed by Manitowoc. That circumstance is not so 
objectionable as to relieve FMC of its appellate burden of establishing error.  Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., 470 U.S. 
564, 571-73, 84 L. Ed. 2d 518, 105 S. Ct. 1504 (1985)."
1617,2," Incredibly, FMC's briefs demand a new trial on validity and enforceability of a noninfringed patent that expired in December 
1986. "
1618,3," As discussed, infra, FMC's Walker Process antitrust claim would require proof of fraud.  Korody-Colyer Corp. v. General Motors 
Corp., 828 F.2d 1572, 1578, 4 U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) 1203, 1207 (Fed. Cir. 1987); Argus Chem. Corp. v. Fibre Glass-Evercoat Co., 
812 F.2d 1381, 1384-85, 1 U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) 1971, 1973-74 (Fed. Cir. 1987)."
1618,4," FMC does not attribute the same shortcomings to the district court's understanding in respect of the infringement issue on 
which FMC prevailed and in relation to which the court applied a claim interpretation FMC here labels legal error."
1618,5," FMC also asserts, and Manitowoc disputes, that Judge Hart erred in not adopting what FMC says was the court's claim 
interpretation in American Hoist & Derrick Co. v. Manitowoc Co., 448 F. Supp. 1372, 197 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 677 (E.D. Wisc. 1978), 
aff'd, 603 F.2d 629, 202 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 705 (7th Cir. 1979). The dispute relates to issues now moot and need not be discussed 
in this opinion. "
1619,6," FMC quotes its witness' testimony on the Q-1064 proposal, but ignores that part of the testimony of Manitowoc's expert, 
Shapiro, in which he said the device shown therein ""would not work."""
1619,7," That we deem unnecessary a detailed discussion of the district court's evaluation of the Q-1064 proposal, the Beduhn speech, 
and the on-sale evidence as nonmaterial does not in any sense suggest either the presence or absence of error of either fact or 
law in that evaluation. Though HN2[
] inequitable conduct involves a balancing of materiality and intent, J.P. Stevens, 747 F.2d at 1560, 223 USPQ at 1092, and an overwhelming showing of materiality plus applicant's knowledge of that materiality may raise 
an inference of intent so strong as to require a convincing showing of subjective good faith to offset it, no such overwhelming 
showing of materiality and knowledge of materiality was made here by FMC. Indeed, the district court refused to find either 
materiality or knowledge of materiality."
1619,8," ""Applicant"" as used here includes the patentee and the attorney who prosecuted the application that resulted in the patent-in-
suit, because the knowledge and actions of applicant's attorney are chargeable to applicant. See Argus Chem. Corp. v. Fibre "
1620,," Glass-Evercoat Co., 759 F.2d 10, 14-15, 225 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 1100, 1103-04 (Fed. Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 903, 88 L. Ed. 
2d 230, 106 S. Ct. 231 (1985)."
1620,9," In J.P. Stevens, 747 F.2d at 1560, 223 USPQ at 1092, ""gross negligence"" was seen as occurring when a reasonable person 
""should have known of the materiality of a withheld reference."" Inequitable conduct was found, but ""gross negligence"" alone was 
not described as mandating a finding of intent to mislead. On the contrary, the court was careful to point out that no evidence of 
subjective good faith was adduced to offset gross negligence."
1620,10," In J.P. Stevens and in Driscoll v. Cebalo, 731 F.2d 878, 221 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 745 (Fed. Cir. 1984), applicants unsuccessfully 
asserted that their failure to disclose was acceptable because it was based on their own particular claim interpretations which in 
turn rendered the withheld references nonmaterial. "
1621,11," FMC says legal error is evidenced by Judge Hart's statement that ""a determination of 'inequitable conduct' may not be based 
on inferences,"" 654 F. Supp. at 934, 2 USPQ2d at 1983, yet the statement is absolutely accurate. This court has held that HN10[ ] one attempting to establish ""inequitable conduct"" must meet a ""clear and convincing"" standard.  J.P. Stevens, 747 F.2d at"
1621,1559," , 223 USPQ at 1092."
1621,12," As Judge Rich said in In re Ruscetta, 45 C.C.P.A. 968, 255 F.2d 687, 689, 118 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 101, 103 (CCPA 1958): HN11[
] Undue liberties should not be taken with court decisions, which should be construed in accordance with the 
precise issue before the court, and . . . a fertile source of error in patent law is the misapplication of a sound legal principle 
established in one case to another case in which the facts are essentially different and the principle has no application 
whatsoever."
1621,13," FMC's argument that Judge Hart erred in not applying inequitable conduct standards to individual claims is rendered 
superfluous by the finding of no intent even if the documents were pertinent prior art. "
1622,14," Judge Hart decided the present case and Hemstreet v. Burroughs Corp., 666 F. Supp. 1096, 2 U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) 1001 
(N.D. Ill. 1987) on the same day. In the latter, he granted summary judgment of patent unenforceability on the ground of 
inequitable conduct, applying the law to a different factual foundation."
1622,15," FMC says, without record citation, that, even if the patent were not procured by fraud, Manitowoc asserted it in bad faith after 
learning that it was invalid. In view of its holding of validity and absence of inequitable conduct, the district court properly ignored 
the assertion."
1622,16," HN13[
] Mere procurement of a patent, whatever the conduct of the applicant in the procurement, cannot without more affect 
the welfare of the consumer and cannot in itself violate the antitrust laws. See generally R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 50-51 
(1978); W. Bowman, Patent and Antitrust Law 1, 2-3, 14 (1973)."
1622,17," As with other issues not requiring discussion, see supra note 7, the absence of discussion suggests neither the presence nor 
absence of error of either fact or law in the district court's findings and conclusions on relevant market and monopoly power. "
1623,18," HN14[
] ""It is allowable to reason back from a judgment to the basis on which it stands, 'upon the obvious principle that, 
where a conclusion is indisputable and could have been drawn only from certain premises, the premises are equally indisputable 
with the conclusion.'"" 1B J. Moore, J. Lucas & T. Currier, Moore's Federal Practice para. 0.443[4] at 776 (2d ed. 1984), quoting 
Burlen v. Shannon, 99 Mass. 200, 203 (1868). "
1628,1," None of the motions before the court addresses the underlying merits of plaintiffs' antitrust claims. The substantive issue being 
decided today involves only the threshold question whether the practices at issue are insulated by a labor exemption."
1628,2," Apart from its argument that the practices in question are immune from antitrust scrutiny because they were included in the 
most recent collective bargaining agreement, the NBA does not contend that any aspect of the Robertson litigation or settlement 
agreement precludes plaintiffs' claims. "
1630,3," The scope of the nonstatutory exemption is generally thought to be the same in the traditional labor cases, where it is often 
used as a defense against claims that employer-employee agreements restrain trade in product markets, and in the sports 
arena, where teams have used it to block their own employees' claims that player restraints illegally bridle competition in the 
intraleague labor market. See Mackey, 543 F.2d at 614 n.12."
1630,4," Indeed, under the test in Mackey, the restraints at issue were shielded from antitrust attack during the terms of the applicable 
agreements because (1) they related to a mandatory subject of collective bargaining, with respect to which the NBA and the 
Players Association were required to bargain in good faith pursuant to section 8(d) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. sec. 158(d); (2) they "
1631,," were the product of arm's-length negotiations between the NBA and the Players Association; and (3) they affect only the terms 
and conditions upon which current and prospective players are employed by NBA teams and do not affect any product market in 
which the NBA competes. It is also apparent that, should the provisions be embodied in a new collective bargaining agreement, 
they would again be immune from antitrust challenge. "
1632,5," Under the NLRA, impasse exists when the parties have exhausted the prospects of concluding an agreement and further 
discussions would be fruitless. The National Labor Relations Board has summarized the factors to be considered in determining 
the existence of an impasse as follows:HN6[
] Whether a bargaining impasse exists is a matter of judgment. The bargaining history, the good faith of the parties in 
negotiations, the length of the negotiations, the importance of the issue or issues as to which there is disagreement, the 
contemporaneous understanding of the parties as to the state of negotiations, are all relevant factors to be considered in 
deciding whether an impasse in bargaining existed. Taft Broadcasting Co., 163 N.L.R.B. 475 (1967), enf'd sub nom.  American Federation of Television and Radio Artists v. NLRB, 
129 U.S. App. D.C. 399, 395 F.2d 622 (D.C. Cir. 1968). "
1633,6," Of course, if the employer changes a practice that was allowed in the expired collective bargaining agreement, then the 
exemption for that practice is lost until it is actually included in a new agreement, whether or not the employer reasonably 
believes that it will survive in the next agreement. "
