24,*," Honorable Frederick A. Daugherty, Senior District Judge for the United States District Court for the Western District of 
Oklahoma, sitting by designation. "
25,1," In this opinion, Visa USA designates the joint venture named as the defendant. We refer to its credit cards simply as Visa."
25,2," The Visa USA Board draws its members from twelve designated regions, each electing a representative, generally a bank's 
chief executive officer or chief operating officer. Based on a formula, larger regions may have a second board seat. Seven 
directors are elected nationally, and a separate seat is reserved for a director who represents small banks. Citicorp has its own 
seat on the board based on the rule of automatic appointment to any member with more than ten percent of the total volume of 
outstanding cards. MasterCard board members are not permitted to sit on the Visa USA board."
25,3," Sears, Roebuck and Company is the parent corporation of Sears Consumer Financial Corporation and Dean Witter Financial 
Services Group, its wholly owned subsidiaries. Sears' counsel informed the court during oral argument that Dean Witter then 
owned plaintiff MountainWest. However, the designation Sears in this opinion collectivizes plaintiff bank and the Sears entities 
involved in the litigation. "
26,4," In 1991, approximately 24 million Discover cards had been issued, while Citicorp had approximately 21 million cards in the 
market. "
27,5," In part, section 1 states, HN3[
] ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of 
trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" "
29,6," BMI, NCAA, and Northwest Wholesale Stationers are emblematic and not intended to be all inclusive or exhaustive of the 
extant Supreme Court precedent on joint ventures under section 1."
29,7," We would note, however, some of the commentary on the antitrust treatment of joint ventures suggests a different approach. 
See, e.g., Thomas A. Piraino, Jr., Beyond Per Se, Rule of Reason or Analysis: A New Antitrust Standard for Joint Ventures, 76 
Minn. L. Rev. 1 (1992); Joseph F. Brodley, Joint Ventures and Antitrust Policy, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 1523 (1982)."
29,8," The 1984 Department of Justice Merger Guidelines define market power as ""the ability of one or more firms profitably to 
maintain prices above a competitive level for a significant period of time."" U.S. Dept. of Justice Merger Guidelines (1984), 
reprinted in 4Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH) P 13,103 at 20,556. "
30,9," These screens or filters are presumptions in antitrust analysis. They ""help to screen out cases in which the risk of loss to 
consumers and the economy is sufficiently small that there is no need of extended inquiry and significant risk that inquiry would 
lead to wrongful condemnation or to the deterrence of competitive activity as firms try to steer clear of the danger zone."" Frank 
H. Easterbrook, The Limits of Antitrust, 63 Tex. L. Rev. 1, 17 (1984). These ""simple rules [] will filter the category of probably-
beneficial practices out of the legal system, leaving to assessment under the Rule of Reason only those with significant risks of 
competitive injury."" Id."
30,10," Again, we recognize the overlaps in analysis between section 1 and section 2 cases as did the district court. Nevertheless, the 
differences must be underscored, the former involving conduct that doesn't alter market structure; the latter, ""a pernicious market 
structure in which the concentration of power saps the salubrious influence of competition."" Berkey Photo, Inc. v. Eastman 
Kodak Co., 603 F.2d 263, 272 (2d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1093, 62 L. Ed. 2d 783, 100 S. Ct. 1061 (1980). "
31,11," Although Sears does not dispute this characterization of the market, it contends it attempted to launch its Prime Option 
program under the Visa aegis to ""compete more effectively"" at the issuer level. By offering multiple credit cards, Discover and 
Prime Option Visa, Sears contended it would then ""strengthen competition."" "
32,12," This revision of the market distinguishes this case from Reazin v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Kan., 899 F.2d 951 (10th Cir.), 
cert. denied, 497 U.S. 1005, 111 L. Ed. 2d 752, 110 S. Ct. 3241 (1990), upon which Sears relies."
32,13," Ironically, the district court rejected Visa USA's argument that the present market is highly concentrated, such that admitting 
Sears would constitute a violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act. After discussing the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), which 
is used to determine market concentration, the district court rejected Visa USA's aggregation of market shares, stating ""the court 
agrees with Visa's expert Professor Schmalensee that each individual issuer of Visa and MasterCard cards should be included 
in the HHI analysis, resulting in a system HHI of below 500."" SCFC ILC, Inc. v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 819 F. Supp. 956, 994 (D. Utah 
1993). This figure represents an unconcentrated market. "
33,14," In particular, Sears' disincentive argument provides the widest array of speculation and raises concerns about its standing to 
represent the supposed injury of others hoping to start up proprietary charge cards. Nevertheless, the parties each shared in 
charting the court's terrain."
33,15," In testimony, Katz explained, not only was Justice Department scrutiny a concern, but also ""attorneys general around the 
country who had been looking at Visa and deciding whether it is too large."" "
34,16," The new policy responded as well to deregulation of the moving industry. Although regulatory constraints figured in the 
analysis, the resolution of the central issue was not dependent on that context."
34,17," That is, its interstate rivals can no longer compete in interstate hauling both as Atlas agents and as independent agents. The 
policy, then, is analogous to the rule at issue here."
34,18, We note that American Express has never participated in this lawsuit. 
35,19," Terminal Railroad and Associated Press are the roots of the essential facility analysis in antitrust. See Phillip E. Areeda, 
Essential Facilities: An Epithet in Need of Limiting Principles, 58 Antitrust L.J. 841 (1990). "
36,20," Indeed, when the question becomes whether the restraint is reasonably necessary to achieve the joint venture's goals, 
""exclusivity of venture membership will not generally be regarded as suspect."" 1993 Supplement P 1506, at 1115. The 
Department of Justice has stated: Selectivity in the membership of a joint venture often enhances a joint venture's procompetitive potential. Forcing joint ventures 
to open membership to all competitors (or to license the product of an R&D joint venture to all who seek licenses) would 
decrease the incentives to form joint ventures . . . For example, the inability to exclude those who would bring little or nothing to 
the joint venture, or those who would fail to share fully in the risks, would decrease the efficiency of the joint venture and reduce 
the expected reward from successfully accomplishing the joint venture's mission. An enforcement policy that denied a joint 
venture the ability to select its members might also encourage firms to forego risky endeavors in the hope of being able to gain 
access through antitrust litigation to the fruits of the successful endeavors of others. Thus, the Department [of Justice] generally 
will be concerned about a joint venture's policy of excluding others only if (i) an excluded firm cannot compete in a related market 
or markets . . . in which the joint venture members are currently exercising market power without having access to the joint 
venture and (ii) there is no reasonable basis related to the efficient operation of the joint venture for excluding other firms. Justice Department, International Operations Antitrust Enforcement Policy 42 (Nov. 10, 1988) (CCH Supp.) (quoted in 1993 
Supplement P 1506, at 1115). "
40,1," These defendants include A.E.V., Inc.; Q.F.A., Inc.; Jet Distributors, Inc.; Red Sky, Inc.; and Beer and Pop Warehouse, Inc. "
42,2," Primary line injury, on the other hand, involves discrimination resulting in injury to a seller's competitors. Barr Laboratories, 978 
F.2d at 106."
42,3," ""In commerce"" means in interstate commerce, for purpose of the antitrust laws. 15 U.S.C. § 12 (Supp. 1994). "
43,4," Lutheran also argues that its ""transfers"" of Guinness beers to West Virginia wholesalers are consummated in Pennsylvania and 
thus do not cross a state line. We do not agree with this contention. Merely because a sales transaction occurred in 
Pennsylvania is not determinative of whether that sale was ""interstate,"" especially when all parties to the sales transactions were 
aware that the goods were ultimately destined for outside the state. Technicalities such as where title to the goods passed are 
immaterial. White Industries v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 657 F. Supp. 687, 699 (W.D. Mo. 1986). "
48,1, For the purposes of this motion the defendants accept as true the allegations of the complaint. 
49,2," In its response to Def. SOF P 8, Paddock states that its expert believes that only the Tribune, Sun-Times and Daily Herald are 
attempting to compete in the entire metropolitan area. Limiting the market to these three newspapers yields figures of 53%, 38% 
and 9% respectively. "
52,3," The defendants contend that Count I should be dismissed as to the syndicates and news services because § 7 applies only to 
acquiring persons. However, Paddock points out that sellers can be joined as defendants in a § 7 action when the plaintiff seeks 
rescission or divestiture and the court needs jurisdiction over both the buying and selling company in order to fashion 
appropriate equitable relief. United States v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los Angeles, 575 F.2d 222, 227-28 (9th Cir. 1978). 
Accordingly we do not recommend dismissal of Count I against the licensors on this ground. "
53,4," In Scheidler, providers and potential consumers of abortion services sued individuals and organizations who had allegedly 
conspired to put abortion clinics out of business through intimidation and harassment. Plaintiffs claimed defendants' conduct 
violated RICO and the Sherman Act. The Seventh Circuit held that neither statute applied. The Supreme Court granted certiorari 
as to the RICO claim and reversed the Seventh Circuit without addressing the dismissal of the Sherman Act claim. "
54,5," Paddock contends that there is a dispute of fact concerning the duration of these contracts, Pl. Br. at 43, but offers no 
evidence indicating that they are not terminable in accordance with their provisions. Nor has Paddock offered any evidence that 
would tend to show that a competitor could not bid against the Tribune or Sun-Times and induce a syndicate or news service to 
exercise its termination rights in order to grant the competitor a more remunerative contract."
54,6," The Chicago Tribune's three-year contracts with the NYTNS, New York Times Picture Service and the Universal Press 
Syndicate, and its five-year contract with United Features Syndicate for the ""Peanuts"" comic strip. "
55,7," Should the court disagree with our conclusion that the Clayton Act is inapplicable, the Seventh Circuit has indicated that the 
Rule of Reason analysis under § 7 of the Clayton Act follows the same standard as under § 1 of the Sherman Act -- whether the 
merger or acquisition is likely to reduce competition substantially. Rockford Memorial, 898 F.2d at 1282-83. The following 
attempt to apply the Rule of Reason under the Sherman Act may then be helpful."
55,8," In addition to Woodbury, we have found two cases challenging newspapers' exclusive licensing of news or features under the 
Sherman Act. United States v. Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate and Globe Newspaper Co. (S.D.N.Y. 1975), resulted 
in a consent decree, 1975 Trade Cases (CCH) P 60,185 (March 5, 1975), but no published discussion of antitrust issues. 762 
F.2d 1374 (9th Cir. 1985), affirmed the denial of a preliminary injunction in a suit under § 2 of the Sherman Act but did not 
discuss the merits. "
56,9," Respected commentators have taken the position that antitrust law should not be concerned with manufacturers' restrictions 
on dealers at all. See F. Easterbrook, Vertical Arrangements and the Rule of Reason, 53 Antitrust L.J. 135 (1984). Courts cannot "
57,," go that far until the Supreme Court overrules precedents declaring vertical price restraints unlawful per se. See Business 
Electronics, 485 U.S. 717 at 733-36, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808, 108 S. Ct. 1515; Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co., 220 
U.S. 373, 55 L. Ed. 502, 31 S. Ct. 376 (1911). Nevertheless courts today regard complaints of vertical restraints in the dealer 
relationship with great skepticism."
57,10," It could be argued that any ""product"" sold at retail is actually the sum of the product the dealer receives from the manufacturer 
and the incidental products and services the dealer provides. A car dealer's showroom, salesperson's time, warranty service and 
dealer-added accessories, for example, are all added into the package a customer buys when he or she buys a car. 
Nevertheless, at some point the value added by the second party is determinative. A newspaper is no more incidental 
""packaging"" for the syndicated stories it buys than a bus is ""packaging"" for the truck chassis upon which it is built."
57,11," Ralph C. Wilson Industries v. Chronicle Broadcasting Co., 794 F.2d 1359, 1364 (9th Cir. 1986) is typical. The plaintiff, a 
television broadcaster, had challenged exclusive licenses granted to nearby stations by programming suppliers. It claimed it was 
in a different market from these licensees, so that its exclusion was unreasonable under § 1 of the Sherman Act. The parties 
agreed that the product market was ""quality"" television programming. After deciding plaintiff was, in fact, in the same geographic 
market, the court held that the plaintiff could not challenge the exclusive licenses, since it had not shown that it was unable to bid 
for quality programming, that prices were fixed or output restricted; it was simply unwilling to pay the going rate in the existing 
market. "
58,12," The Tribune has been able to maintain its lead over the Sun-Times despite holding its prices 42 percent above the Sun-
Times's daily price and 20 percent above its Sunday price. Shepard Aff. P 24. This indicates that there is price competition 
between the two newspapers. The Tribune's ability to maintain its market share shows that consumers consider it a superior 
product. However, accepting Paddock's evidence as true, duopoly makes future price fixing more likely. It should also be pointed 
out that it is logically possible for two producers of differentiated products in the same market to agree on a price differential, so 
a persistent price differential between two competing products does not prove that effective competition exists. It only shows that 
consumers do not regard the two as equivalent. "
61,13," A possible effect of non-exclusive licensing is that news services considered inferior would lose the market formerly reserved 
to them -- those newspapers excluded from the better services. Exclusive licensing guarantees the continued existence of at 
least one or two competitors to the leading news service in order to serve those markets having more than one newspaper. If all 
newspapers had access to the leading service, other supplementary news services might have to cut their prices to correspond 
to the marginal value they would provide, and might not survive. However, since the antitrust laws protect competition, not 
competitors, this would not be sufficient reason to preserve exclusive licensing. "
62,14," Paddock also submitted an article discussing this lawsuit that appeared in Editor and Publisher for December 18, 1993 
recounting that unnamed syndicate executives had stated that they would welcome an end to exclusivity. Pl. Exh. 107 at 47. 
This is inadmissible hearsay and has no place in a response to a summary judgment motion. "
64,15," But cf. Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. United Airlines, Inc., 948 F.2d 536, 542-546 (9th Cir. 1991) (considering and ultimately rejecting 
an ""essential facility"" claim against two airlines, each of which maintained a computer reservation service)."
64,16," It may be that concert promoters are mere middlemen and the consuming public can be offered the same artists or concerts 
through either promoter. If so, the exclusion of Flip Side might have had no impact on consumers; any performer the Chicago 
public was likely to want could be brought to Chicago by one of Flip Side's competitors. If, on the other hand, if Flip Side could 
produce concerts its competitors could not, the situation would be roughly comparable to the present case where excluding 
competing newspapers from a necessary input restricts consumer choices. "
69,1," The Honorable James B. Moran, Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, is sitting by 
designation. "
71,2," Hammes v. AAMCO Transmissions, Inc., 33 F.3d 774 (7th Cir., 1994), issued just prior to the release of this opinion, reaches 
essentially the same conclusion. That conclusion would, in any event, be binding here. "
72,3," We do not think it significant, as the dissent suggests, that plaintiffs have usually lost at the summary judgment stage rather 
than by dismissal. What is significant is that they have lost as a matter of law because of an apparently uniform conclusion that, 
HN5[
] without something more, a staffing pattern dispute at one hospital does not cause an unreasonable restraint of trade 
within the ambit of the antitrust laws. Once the plaintiff had survived the jurisdictional challenge in Hammes there could be no 
doubt that the unreasonable restraint alleged was within that ambit: a conspiracy among a number of competitors in the 
Indianapolis market to allocate automobile transmission customers. "
76,1," This is an expedited appeal pursuant to RULE 809.17, STATS."
76,2," Section 133.03, STATS., provides in relevant part: HN1[
] ""(1) Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or 
conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce is illegal."""
76,3," The city also alleged that it could terminate the contract pursuant to a provision regarding construction of an incinerator, but no 
argument related to that issue is made on appeal. "
77,4," HN4[
] ""Person"" includes municipalities. Section 806.04(13), STATS. "
87,1," ""A party may amend the party's pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served . . ."" 
Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). A motion to dismiss is not a ""responsive pleading"" within the meaning of Rule 15, and as such a complaint 
may be amended notwithstanding the filing of a motion to dismiss as a matter of course -- i.e., without leave of court. Mayes v. 
Leipziger, 729 F.2d 605, 607, 608 (9th Cir. 1984); Worldwide Church of God. Inc. v. State of California, 623 F.2d 613, 616 (9th

96,50," The request to strike references to ""marital communities"" is denied as moot inasmuch as Dr. Chabra's wife, Karin Chabra, has

103,1," See also H.R.Rep. No. 903, at 3, reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6385 (noting that ""even though defendants may often win 
these lawsuits, that may not be sufficient to guarantee enthusiastic, or even minimally adequate, peer review"" because ""doctors 
who are sufficiently fearful of the threat of litigation will simply not do meaningful peer review"")."
103,2," In another set of provisions, HCQIA requires health care entities to report certain specific disciplinary actions taken against a 
staff physician (or the acceptance of a resignation or suspension in return for not conducting investigations or disciplinary 
proceedings) to a national clearinghouse established to collect and disseminate information on health care providers.  42 U.S.C. 
§§ 11133-34. Then, prior to admitting a physician to its staff, a hospital must obtain that physician's records from the 
clearinghouse. Id. § 11135. These reporting requirements were designed to ""restrict the ability of incompetent physicians to 
move from State to State without disclosure or discovery of the physician's previous damaging or incompetent performance."" Id. 
§ 11101(2) (reciting congressional findings). Congress recognized that physicians faced with disciplinary action, no longer able 
to hide their previous discipline, would feel compelled to challenge any action taken against them in the courts. See H.R.Rep. 
No. 903, at 3, reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6385. Accordingly, the reporting requirements increased the need to protect 
peer review participants from liability. "
104,," The Secretary of Health and Human Services may, following an investigation, publish in the Federal Register the name of a 
health care entity that has failed to comply with these reporting requirements; a hospital so identified then loses the 
protection of HCQIA immunity provisions for three years.  42 U.S.C. § 11111(b)."
104,3," It is important to note that we use the term ""immunity"" here in a limited sense. See H.R.Rep. No. 903, at 3, reprinted in 1986 
U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6385. HCQIA establishes an immunity only from liability for money damages, not a right to avoid standing trial. 
As the Tenth Circuit has concluded, HN2[
] ""the plain meaning of [42 U.S.C. § 11111(a)(1) ] is that professional review bodies and covered individuals who satisfy the requirements of § 11112(a) are immune from liability only. On its face, the provision 
does not explicitly establish immunity from suit."" Decker v. IHC Hosps., Inc., 982 F.2d 433, 436 (10th Cir.1992) (footnote 
omitted) (holding that motions to dismiss based on HCQIA immunity are not immediately appealable), cert. denied,     U.S.    , 
113 S. Ct. 3041, 125 L. Ed. 2d 727 (1993); accord Manion v. Evans, 986 F.2d 1036, 1042 (6th Cir.1993). This reading of the statute comports with the legislative history surrounding its adoption. According to the report of the 
House Committee on Energy and Commerce: Initially, the Committee considered establishing a very broad protection from suit for professional review actions. In 
response to concerns that such protection might be abused and serve as a shield for anti-competitive economic actions 
under the guise of quality controls, however, the Committee restricted the broad protection. As redrafted, the bill now 
provides protection only from damages in private actions, and only for proper peer review, as defined in the bill. H.R.Rep. No. 903, at 9, reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6391."
104,4," HN4[
] Section 11111(a)(1) expressly excludes from its coverage suits brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 or Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but it clearly does apply to antitrust claims. See Patrick v. Burget, 486 U.S. 94, 105 n. 8, 108 S. Ct. 1658, 
1665 n. 8, 100 L. Ed. 2d 83 (1988). The section states, however, that ""nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the United States 
or any Attorney General of a State from bringing an action, including an action under [section 4C of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 
15C], where such an action is otherwise authorized."" 42 U.S.C. § 11111(a)(1). And HCQIA ""does not restrict the rights of 
physicians who are disciplined to bring private causes of action for injunctive or declaratory relief."" H.R.Rep. No. 903, at 9, 
reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6391. "

106,6," See Fla.Stat.Ann. § 395.0193(2) (West 1993) (""HN6[
] Each licensed [health care] facility, as a condition of licensure, shall 
provide for peer review of physicians who deliver health care services at the facility."")."
106,7," Investigations may be requested, according to the bylaws, by various officers of the medical staff, including the chairpersons of 
various committees and clinical departments. Such requests must be made in writing to the executive committee and must refer 
to the specific conduct that constitutes the basis for the request."
106,8," All or part of the physician's privileges may be suspended temporarily pending the outcome of the inquiry. The relevant 
provision of the bylaws provides: At any time during the investigation, the Executive Committee or the Medical Staff President or his designee may suspend 
all or any part of the clinical privileges of the individual being investigated. This suspension shall be deemed to be 
administrative in nature, for the protection of hospital patients. It shall be in effect during the investigation only, shall not 
indicate the truth of the charges, and shall remain in force, without appeal, during the course of the investigation."
106,9," The procedure is slightly different when the executive committee settles on a less severe form of discipline. If the action of the 
executive committee does not involve the reduction, suspension, or revocation of staff privileges, the bylaws provide that ""it shall 
take effect immediately without action of, and without the right of appeal to the Board."" A report of the action is sent to the board, 
which may modify the executive committee's decision on its own initiative. Should the board decide to reject a favorable 
recommendation by the executive committee and impose a more severe form of discipline that involves the suspension or 
revocation of clinical privileges, however, the physician would then be entitled to a hearing (according to the same procedures) 
before the board enters a final decision. "
107,10," If the board's review panel recommends action to the board that is contrary to the recommendation of the medical staff, and if 
a physician's privileges are at issue, then the matter is first reviewed by a joint conference committee, comprised of members of 
the board and the medical staff, before the board makes a final decision. "
108,11," The medical staff bylaw that contains this provision does not indicate to whom the board may ""refer the matter for further 
review."""
108,12," Some insight into the origins of this behavior came from Bryan himself during his testimony at trial. Shortly after completing his 
residency, Bryan obtained staff privileges at a Veterans Administration hospital in Miami. There, he explained, he soon learned 
that the hospital could not fire incompetent nurses and other technicians easily; the most effective way to avoid working with 
nurses he viewed as incompetent or inefficient, he discovered, was to insult them until they refused to participate in operations 
involving his patients. "
109,13," Under the bylaws, Bryan's presence was not required at this stage of the proceedings."
109,14," In response to this criticism, the incident report system at Holmes was changed to ensure that copies of all incident reports 
would be provided to the subject soon after they were filed. "
110,15," By letter dated May 18, 1990, Dr. Barry Mills, the chief of the medical staff, suspended Bryan's clinical privileges pending an 
investigation into these matters. This suspension was considered administrative in nature; under the bylaws, Bryan was allowed 
to continue to care for patients already admitted to the Hospital, but he could not admit any additional patients."
110,16," The hearing panel members were appointed by Dr. Mills with the approval of the executive committee. Bryan challenged the 
initial composition of the panel, alleging bias on the part of Dr. William Broussard, who advised Bryan to seek counseling for his 
interpersonal problems in 1982. Bryan also contended that the panel should be composed solely of surgeons. In response to 
Bryan's objections, Mills selected a new panel member to replace Broussard but did not remove the non-surgeons who had 
previously been named. As provided by the bylaws, none of the panel members were vascular surgeons (Bryan's direct 
economic competitors). Bryan did not object to the reconstituted hearing panel."
110,17," During the Chanda panel proceedings, the medical staff attempted to introduce all of the prior incident reports involving 
Bryan's behavior to demonstrate the pattern of misconduct that had led to the board's warning regarding termination of 
privileges. The hearing officer refused to admit those reports into evidence. On the last day of the proceedings, however, Bryan 
called Dr. Ryon to testify regarding the earlier incident reports that his panel had considered; Bryan attempted to elicit testimony 
that there was no pattern of inappropriate conduct by Bryan. Because Bryan had brought the earlier incident reports into issue, 
the Chanda panel asked the hearing officer sua sponte to review the reports, which he allowed at the last session of the 
hearings. Although Bryan complained that the reports should not be reviewed at that late stage of the proceedings, he did not 
formally object, assert a violation of the Hospital's bylaws, or ask to reopen the hearing to present evidence in rebuttal. Several 
Holmes officials who testified at trial agreed that Bryan could have requested a postponement to prepare a response if he was 
concerned about these last-minute developments. "
111,18," Bryan has repeatedly emphasized that the board members did not themselves read the complete transcript of the Chanda 
panel proceedings before reaching the decision to terminate Bryan's privileges. Bryan, however, had the opportunity to obtain a 
copy of the transcript of the hearings so that he could refer to specific portions in presenting his appeal to the board; he did not 
do so. Nor does the record indicate that he claimed at the time that the bylaws required the board to obtain the transcript before 
taking action concerning his staff privileges. Moreover, the text of the relevant medical staff bylaw provision states only that ""the 
Hearing Panel shall maintain a record of the hearing by a reporter present to make a record of the hearing or a recording of the 
proceedings. The cost of such a reporter shall be borne by the hospital."" A transcript of the first day of the Chanda panel 
hearings was prepared at Bryan's request and was available for the board's consideration."
111,19," The complaint also included the following various ancillary claims: (1) constitutional and civil rights claims under 42 U.S.C. § 
1983 (1988); (2) federal contractual claims arising out of the Hospital's participation in the Medicare program; and (3) claims of 
""interference with prospective economic advantage"" and intentional infliction of emotional distress. These causes of action did 
not figure prominently in the litigation of this case, and the court disposed of these claims either on summary judgment or by 
granting a directed verdict in favor of the defendants. Because these claims are not before us on appeal, we do not discuss them 
further in this opinion. "
112,20," For the text of the relevant HCQIA provisions, see supra part I. The Florida statute requiring that hospitals institute peer review 
procedures also provides legal protection to participants. The Florida law provides: HN7[
] There shall be no monetary liability on the part of, and no cause of action for damages against, any licensed 
facility, its governing board or governing board members, peer review panel, medical staff, or disciplinary body, or its 
agents, investigators, witnesses, employees, or any other person for any action taken without intentional fraud in carrying 
out the provisions of this section. Fla.Stat.Ann. § 395.0193(5)."
112,21," This circuit applies a two-pronged test of antitrust standing: The court must first determine that the plaintiff has suffered "" 
""antitrust injury' "" and then decide whether the plaintiff is ""an efficient enforcer of the antitrust laws."" Todorov v. DCH Healthcare 
Auth., 921 F.2d 1438, 1449 (11th Cir.1991). The district court held that Bryan had failed to demonstrate that he was an efficient 
antitrust enforcer."
112,22," At trial, as before the Chanda panel, Bryan presented testimony from various expert witnesses explaining that Bryan's actions 
were proper and did not adversely affect patient care; nothing in the record, they testified, would justify the revocation of Bryan's 
clinical privileges. This testimony was discounted by the Chanda panel. The experts themselves acknowledged at trial that a 
pattern of disruptive behavior could become so severe that disciplinary action would be required; on cross-examination, the 
experts also admitted that they had not examined all of the information considered by the Chanda panel. The Hospital also 
countered with expert testimony explaining why termination of Bryan's privileges was consistent with sound hospital 
administration. Bryan also presented the testimony of witnesses who found fault with the Hospital's peer review procedures, particularly 
that a transcript of the Chanda panel hearings was not prepared for the board's use and that the Chanda hearing officer 
had become too inquisitorial in his questioning. "
113,23," The following colloquy occurred during the brief charge conference after the court informed counsel of its intended 
instructions: [COUNSEL FOR HOLMES]: The special verdict as read does not include any of the immunity issues. Based on your 
decision on the directed verdict you've left the decision to the jury and we would respectfully request that the jury be 
instructed on the immunities. THE COURT: I think that would be confusing to the jury, that's why I left them out. Of course, you can use that in your 
argument."
113,24," As the House Committee explained: The provisions would allow a court to make a determination that the defendant has or has not met the standards specified 
in section [11112(a) ]. The Committee intends that the court could so rule even though other issues in the case remain to 
be resolved. For example, a court might determine at an early stage of litigation that the defendant has met the [section 
11112(a) ] standards, even though the plaintiff might be able to demonstrate that the professional review action was 
otherwise improper. At that point, it would be in order for the court to rule on immunity. In such a case, the court could still 
proceed to determine whether injunctive, declaratory, or other relief would be in order. H.R.Rep. No. 903, at 12, reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6394; see also Austin, 979 F.2d at 734 & n. 5. "
114,25," The American Medical Association, appearing as amicus curiae in this case, urged this position on the court: Under the HCQIA, the vast majority of lawsuits challenging peer review proceedings should be dismissed at the summary 
judgment stage. Suits against peer reviewers should be allowed to go forward only when the plaintiff has rebutted the 
presumption that the peer review proceeding was reasonable and fair. Any lesser standard would deter physicians from 
serving as peer reviewers and would therefore undermine the purpose of the HCQIA."
114,26," The qualified immunity analysis in suits against government officials under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 provides a useful comparison. 
Although qualified immunity for government officials is a broader protection than that provided to peer review participants under 
HCQIA, the proper treatment of the two protections is substantially similar. HN10[
] In qualified immunity cases, the favored approach is to have the immunity determination made by the court, prior 
to trial, whenever possible. See Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526, 105 S. Ct. 2806, 2815, 86 L. Ed. 2d 411 (1985) 
(recognizing, of course, that qualified immunity is ""an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability [that] is 
effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial""). When the issue cannot be resolved on summary judgment, 
we have held that ""a jury should seldom, if ever, be instructed on qualified immunity; the availability of a qualified immunity 
defense is a question of law for the court to determine."" Ansley v. Heinrich, 925 F.2d 1339, 1341 (11th Cir.1991). 
Accordingly, ""although the district court preferably makes this determination before trial, qualified immunity is a legal 
determination that must be made by the court and may be made either before trial, during trial, or after trial."" Stone v. 
Peacock, 968 F.2d 1163, 1165 (11th Cir.1992)."
114,27," The Hospital had moved for judgment as a matter of law (for a directed verdict) under Rule 50(a) at the close of Bryan's case 
and again at the close of all the evidence. The court denied both motions, rejecting the Hospital's assertion of immunity from 
monetary liability under the federal and state statutes. The issue, therefore, was properly preserved for a post-trial motion for 
judgment. "
115,28," As the Supreme Court has explained, HN13[
] ""in ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the judge must view the 
evidence presented through the prism of the substantive evidentiary burden."" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 
254, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 2513, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)."
115,29," While its meaning is generally apparent, the statute does provide the following definition of ""professional review activity"": HN15[
] An activity of a health care entity with respect to an individual physician-- "
116,," (A) to determine whether the physician may have clinical privileges with respect to, or membership in, the entity, (B) to determine the scope or conditions of such privileges or membership, or (C) to change or modify such privileges or membership."
116,42," U.S.C. § 11151(10). Again, the termination of Bryan's medical staff privileges clearly falls within HCQIA definition. "
118,30," Because our holding on this point disposes of all of the claims in the case, we need not reach the question of whether the 
Hospital was protected from monetary liability under the Florida peer review statute, Fla.Stat.Ann. § 395.0115(5). Bryan has not 
appealed the district court's refusal to grant injunctive relief under the antitrust laws, thus we need not address the merits of the 
antitrust causes of action. "
121,1," Recent films of this discrete genre include ""The Crying Game,"" ""Strictly Ballroom,"" ""Like Water for Chocolate,"" and ""Enchanted 
April."""
121,2," The Sherman Act provides that every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."
121,15, U.S.C. § 1 (1994).
121,3," The parties agree that Pennsylvania common law follows federal antitrust law as embodied in the Sherman Act. See Schwartz 
v. Laundry & Linen Supply Drivers' Union, Local 187, 339 Pa. 353, 14 A.2d 438 (1940). Thus, Counts I and II of the amended 
complaint will be treated identically. "
123,4," The term ""vertical restraint"" describes an agreement between two or more companies on different levels in the chain of product 
distribution. In Dr. Miles, for example, the challenged restraint was an agreement between a drug manufacturer and wholesale 
dealers to fix resale prices at both the wholesale and retail levels. Dr. Miles, 220 U.S. at 374. Since the Court determined that 
such arrangements had ""for their sole purpose the destruction of competition and the fixing of prices,"" it declared them illegal per 
se. Id. at 408."
123,5," The term ""horizontal restraint"" connotes an agreement among competitors on the same level of the product distribution chain. 
The challenged restraint in Socony-Vacuum involved an agreement among oil companies to fix prices at an artificially high level. 
The Court concluded that any ""combination formed for the purpose and with the effect of raising, depressing, fixing, pegging, or 
stabilizing the price of a commodity in interstate or foreign commerce is illegal per se."" Socony-Vacuum, 310 U.S. at 223."
123,6," In Klor's, the Court was confronted by a ""group boycott,"" in which a number of manufacturers and distributors conspired to 
exclude a retailer from the market. The Court held that such agreements were illegal per se, even absent a specific agreement 
to fix price. Klor's, 359 U.S. at 212."
123,7," A ""vertical non-price restraint"" is an agreement between a manufacturer and a retailer that does not specifically concern price. 
In GTE Sylvania, a television manufacturer entered into franchise agreements that prohibited the sale of its product from other 
than specified locations. Thus, pursuant to the agreement, a retailer was permitted to sell Sylvania televisions from its San 
Francisco outlet, but not from an outlet in Sacramento.  GTE Sylvania, 433 U.S. at 39-40. The Court held that because of the "
124,," complexity of vertical non-price restraints and the likelihood that vertical agreements often enhance competition, such 
agreements were to be evaluated under a rule of reason standard. Id. at 58-59."
124,8," In the context of instant dispute, ""interbrand competition"" refers to competition among film distributors in the art film market. 
""Intrabrand competition,"" on the other hand, refers competition among exhibitors of individual art films. The relief that Orson 
seeks in this case, a declaration that the exclusive runs at the Ritz are illegal, would serve to foster intrabrand competition: 
Orson wants the opportunity to exhibit films like ""The Crying Game"" in direct competition with the Ritz. Interbrand competition 
would be better served if the relief Orson seeks is denied, however, since a greater number of distributors and films would enjoy 
access to the Center City Philadelphia market."
124,9," By utilizing vertical non-price restraints, a manufacturer can induce a retailer to provide informational services about a product, 
repair services, as well as promotional services. Further, vertical non-price restraints work to counteract the so-called ""free-rider"" 
effect. GTE Sylvania, 433 U.S. at 55. "
125,10," ""Clearance,"" in film industry parlance, refers to the exclusivity of the license. Thus, if one theater has clearance for a certain 
film, a distributor may not grant a license to another theater in a given geographical area while the film is playing. "
126,11," These films include ""Double Lives of Veronique,"" ""Hear My Song,"" ""Mediterraneo,"" ""Delicatessen,"" ""Zentropa,"" ""Enchanted 
April,"" ""Reservoir Dogs,"" ""The Crying Game,"" ""Passion Fish,"" ""Strictly Ballroom,"" ""Like Water for Chocolate,"" ""Ethan Frome,"" 
""Map of the Human Heart,"" ""Farewell My Concubine,"" and ""The Piano."" "
127,12," These 9 films include ""Hear My Song,"" ""Enchanted April,"" ""Reservoir Dogs,"" ""The Crying Game,"" ""Map of the Human Heart,"" 
""Strictly Ballroom,"" ""Ethan Frome,"" ""Farewell My Concubine,"" and ""The Piano."" "
128,13, Count III of the amended complaint reads in full as follows: COUNT III VIOLATION OF PENNSYLVANIA FEATURE MOTION PICTURE FAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES LAW
128,41, . The allegations set forth in paragraphs 1-40 above are incorporated herein by reference.
128,42," . Miramax has consistently granted the Ritz licenses for its feature art films for exclusive first runs for more than 42 days, 
and, as a consequence, refused to license such films to plaintiff or any other exhibitors in the Philadelphia area served by 
the Ritz and Roxy theaters. Examples of such excessive exclusive first runs at the Ritz are ""The Crying Game (10 weeks 
exclusivity), ""Like Water for Chocolate"" (over four months exclusivity), and ""Strictly Ballroom"" (15 weeks exclusivity)."
128,43," . Miramax'[s] refusal to license plaintiff in order to honor a license to the Ritz for first-run exclusivity in excess of 42 days 
is in violation of the Pennsylvania Feature Motion Picture Fair Business Practices Law, 73 P.S. Section 203-1 et. seq. (the 
""Act"")."
128,44, . Miramax'[s] violation was -- and continues to be -- willful and intentional.
128,45, . Plaintiff has suffered damages as a direct and proximate result of defendant's willful and intentional violation of the Act. 
133,1," The facts are presented in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, as the nonmoving party.  Seeborg v. General Motors 
Corporation, 284 Or 695, 699, 588 P2d 1100 (1978)."
133,2, Over 95 percent of Oregon dentists are ODS participating dentists.
133,3," Such clauses are alternatively denominated ""most favored customer,"" ""most favored buyer,"" ""price protection,"" and 
""nondiscrimination"" clauses.  The substance is the same.  Celnicker, ""A Competitive Analysis of Most Favored Nations Clauses 
in Contracts Between Health Care Providers and Insurers,"" 69 NC L Rev 863 (1991). "
134,4," Plaintiffs are related corporations controlled by a single shareholder.  Willamette Dental Group and Oregon Dental Specialists 
are both group dental practices.  Willamette Dental Group provides general dentistry services, while Oregon Dental Specialists 
provides specialized dental services such as orthodontics and oral surgery.  Both groups provide dental services to patients 
covered by ODS dental plans and plans supplied by other prepaid dental benefits providers. Dental Registry, Inc. (DRI) was 
organized for the purpose of developing alternative dental care delivery products."
134,5," However, those patients, themselves, must then pay a larger percentage of the dentists' bills."
134,6," Before January 13, 1992, ODS had not strictly enforced Rule 3.  In February 1984, ODS threatened to enforce Rule 3 against 
a dentist who contracted to treat patients covered by American Family Health Services.  However, two days later, ODS informed 
other participating dentists that ODS would not enforce Rule 3 unless reduced fees to American Family constituted a significant 
part of the dentists' practice.  In November 1990, ODS determined that some participating dentists were charging lower fees to 
Vantage PPO.  However, ODS did not take action against those dentists until November 1991.  At that time, ODS informed 
those dentists servicing Vantage patients that ODS would not enforce Rule 3 according to its terms, but would simply not allow 
those dentists to increase their fees with ODS on any procedure where the corresponding ODS fee exceeded the Vantage fee.  
In December 1991, after meeting with Vantage representatives, ODS reversed its position and decided to take no action 
whatsoever with respect to the Vantage dentists. Not until March 1992, after DRI's lawyer complained of discriminatory 
enforcement of Rule 3, did ODS strictly enforce the rule against Vantage dentists."
134,7, The exact number of dentists who resigned from the panel is not specified in the record. 
135,8," After defendants moved for summary judgment, and before the trial court ruled on that motion, plaintiffs withdrew their restraint 
of trade claim.  After filing this appeal, plaintiffs dismissed all claims against ODA."
135,9," The analogous federal statute, Sherman Act, section 2, provides: ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of 
a felony * * *."" 15 USC § 2 (1988 & Supp V 1993). "
136,10," See n 6, supra."
136,11," Our research suggests that Ocean State and Kitsap are the only two reported cases addressing whether the use of a most 
favored nations clause may constitute predatory conduct for the purposes of monopolization or attempted monopolization."
136,12," In Ocean State, an HMO and a class of its physicians sued Blue Cross alleging monopolization under section 2 of the 
Sherman Act. 883 F2d at 1104. Because Blue Cross admitted possessing monopoly power, the only issue was whether Blue 
Cross willfully maintained monopoly power through its use of a most favored nations clause.  883 F2d at 1110. In Kitsap, a 
dental care service provider sued Washington Dental Service (WDS) alleging monopolization of the prepaid dental market under 
section 2 of the Sherman Act after WDS invoked a most favored nations clause against participating dentists. 671 F Supp at 
1268. "
137,13," An efficiency analysis is obviously sensible in other contexts, particularly when a defendant commits alleged predatory 
conduct in its capacity as a seller.  For example, selling below one's incremental cost or forgoing increased sales while refusing 
to cooperate with a competitor may indicate predatory conduct because such conduct does not make economic sense.  See 
Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Co., supra, 472 U.S. at 607-11 (defendant's refusal to cooperate with competitor in 
offering multiple ski area lift tickets caused it to pass up ""immediate benefits"" and supported an inference that defendant was not 
motivated by efficiency concerns)."
137,14," Plaintiffs point particularly to ODS's alleged exclusion of the DRI and Vantage PPOs and assert that the threatened 
enforcement of Rule 3 prevented Blue Cross Blue Shield from forming a PPO.  See n 6, supra. "
138,15, This would seem especially so for those dentists with a relatively smaller ODS patient mix in their practices. 
139,16," Plaintiffs also argue that ODS's conduct was ""improper"" for purposes of the tortious interference claims because ODS 
breached an implied covenant of good faith in the participation agreements between ODS and the dentists who resigned from 
the DRI PPO as a result of ODS's enforcement of Rule 3.  Because plaintiffs failed to raise that argument in contesting summary 
judgment before the circuit court, we decline to address it. "
141,1," In the words of baseball great Yogi Berra, judicial review of baseball's antitrust exemption is ""deja vu all over again."" Familiar 
Quotations 754 (Justin Kaplan ed. 1992). "
142,2," Section 542.28(1), Florida Statutes (Supp. 1992), HN1[
] authorizes the Attorney General to issue a civil investigative 
demand (CID) to any person that the Attorney General has reason to believe may be in possession, custody, or control of 
documentary material or information relevant to a civil antitrust investigation. The CIDs may require that person to produce 
documents for inspection, to answer written interrogatories, or to give sworn testimony."
142,3," In all three cases, the circuit courts of appeals affirmed the dismissal of the player's complaint based upon the baseball 
exemption. See Corbett v. Chandler, 202 F.2d 428 (6th Cir. 1953); Kowalski v. Chandler, 202 F.2d 413 (6th Cir. 1953); Toolson 
v. New York Yankees, 200 F.2d 198 (9th Cir. 1952). "
143,4," As described by the United States Supreme Court, the reserve system ""centers in the uniformity of player contracts; the 
confinement of the player to the club that has him under the contract; the assignability of the player's contract; and the ability of 
the club annually to renew the contract unilaterally, subject to a stated salary minimum."" Flood v. Kuhn, 407 U.S. 258, 259 n.1, 
92 S. Ct. 2099, 32 L. Ed. 2d 728 (1972)."
143,5," The court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the antitrust claims based upon a baseball exemption. Piazza v. Major 
League Baseball, 831 F. Supp. 420, 441 (E.D. Pa. 1993). The court subsequently denied the defendants' motion to certify for 
immediate appeal the denial of that motion to dismiss the antitrust claims.  Piazza v. Major League Baseball, 836 F. Supp. 269 
(E.D. Pa. 1993). The case was scheduled for trial in September 1994.  Piazza v. Major League Baseball, No. CIV.A.92-7173,

144,7," HN2[
] ""Rule stare decisis"" involves the ""'Supreme Court's choice of [the applicable] legal standard or test'"" while ""result stare 
decisis"" is the result reached by applying that legal standard to the particular facts of the case.  Piazza v. Major League 
Baseball, 831 F. Supp. 420, 437-38 (E.D. Pa. 1993) (quoting Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 947 F.2d 682, 691-92 (3d Cir. 
1991), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds, 112 S. Ct. 2791, 120 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1992)). As explained by the district 
court in Piazza, prior to Flood lower courts were bound by both the rule of Federal Baseball and Toolson (that the business of 
baseball is not interstate commerce and thus not within the Sherman Antitrust Act) and the result of those decisions (that 
baseball's reserve system is exempt from the antitrust laws). Id. Because Flood invalidated the rule of Federal Baseball and 
Toolson by declaring that baseball is interstate commerce, the Piazza court concluded that no rule from the earlier cases binds 
the lower courts as a matter of stare decisis. Piazza, 831 F. Supp. at 437-38. Instead, lower courts are only bound by the 
disposition of the case based upon the facts presented, namely that the reserve system is exempt from the antitrust laws. Id. "
145,8," Based upon our conclusion that baseball's antitrust exemption extends only to the reserve system, the Attorney General's CIDs 
to the National League regarding the sale and purchase of the San Francisco Giants baseball franchise may proceed in this 
case. However, our decision should not be considered a ruling on the merits of any antitrust claim against the National League.

169,2," Similarly, the analyses set forth in Monsanto and Matsushita do not apply when a plaintiff has offered direct evidence of 
concerted action. Arnold Pontiac-GMC, Inc. v. Budd Baer, Inc., 826 F.2d 1335, 1338 (3d Cir. 1987). See also In re Coordinated 
Pretrial Proceedings in Petroleum Products Antitrust Litigation, 906 F.2d 432, 441 (9th Cir. 1990)."
169,3," Our review does not include consideration of evidence which was the subject of the three pending motions to supplement the 
record. Nor will we consider citations to evidence in F. Schumacher & Co.'s brief which was not of record before the district 
court."
169,4," In the nomenclature of the marketplace, these 800-number dealers are ""free-riders,"" who reduce or eliminate service to create 
price competition but who benefit from services such as wallpaper sample books, salesperson advice and showroom displays 
paid for and provided by other, full-service retailers. See Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 55, 53 L. Ed. 
2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977); Big Apple BMW, Inc. v. BMW of North America, Inc., 974 F.2d 1358, 1376-77 (3d Cir. 1992). "
170,5," We may, of course, consider evidence of activity necessitating the entry of the consent decree, as well as the terms of the 
consent decree itself, as part of the overall picture, or potential evidence of a pattern of conduct. See Big Apple BMW, 974 F.2d 
at 1361; cf.  Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 699, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777, 82 S. Ct. 1404 (1962). "
172,6," FSC and NDPA argue that these articles constitute inadmissible hearsay. Plaintiffs respond that the articles are admissible as 
statements of NDPA, having been published in its own publications. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2) (statements are not hearsay if 
they are offered against a party and are statements of which the party has ""manifested his adoption or belief in its truth""). We 
agree: an employee of NDPA had to have written these articles, which were adopted by NDPA when it published them in 
Decorating Retailer and Wallcovering Industry News. Wells' statements as reflected in the articles are, therefore, admissible. "
173,7," Their amended complaint indicates that plaintiffs originally were concerned about two additional FSC policies: FSC's failure to 
discuss cooperative advertising possibilities with 800-number dealers though it did so with conventional retailers, and FSC's 
charging state sales tax on drop shipments. These policies, however, are not subjects of this appeal. "
174,8," NDPA and FSC argue that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal because the district court failed to enter a judgment on a 
separate document in accordance with Rule 58 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and had not yet awarded costs in 
accordance with Rule 54(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In Bankers Trust Co. v. Mallis, 435 U.S. 381, 55 L. Ed. 2d 357, 98 S. Ct. 1117 (1978) (per curiam), however, the Supreme Court 
recognized that the rules of civil procedure requiring entry of judgment on a separate document should be interpreted in a 
common-sense fashion. ""If, by error, a separate judgment is not filed before a party appeals, nothing but delay would flow from 
requiring the court of appeals to dismiss the appeal."" Mallis, 435 U.S. at 385-86. See also International Brotherhood of 
Teamsters v. Western Pennsylvania Motor Carriers Assoc., 660 F.2d 76, 80 (3d Cir. 1981). The district court's failure to enter 
judgment in accordance with the dictates of Rule 58 appears to stem from oversight. No other plausible suggestion has been 
advanced. Thus, we reject this jurisdictional argument. As to costs, we note that the parties' stipulation of settlement, which disposed of those counts as to which the district court had 
not granted summary judgment and which was entered as an order by the district court, provided that each party was to bear its 
own costs, thus implicitly if not actually resolving any Rule 54(d) issue. "
175,9," It would be incorrect to require an official board resolution, or other officially sanctioned activity, to impose liability on NDPA. 
Recognizing that perpetrators of antitrust violations are often sophisticated businessmen, courts regularly permit agreements to 
be shown by circumstantial evidence. See Big Apple BMW, 974 F.2d at 1364; Theatre Enterprises, Inc. v. Paramount Film 
Distributing Corp., 346 U.S. 537, 540-41, 98 L. Ed. 273, 74 S. Ct. 257 (1954). "
176,10," Judge Boudin notes that the Supreme Court in Hydrolevel viewed ASME as an ""extra-governmental agency"" regulating its own 
industry.  American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Inc. v. Hydrolevel Corp., 456 U.S. 556, 570, 72 L. Ed. 2d 330, 102 S. Ct. 
1935 (1982). See M. Boudin, Antitrust Doctrine and the Sway of Metaphor, 75 Geo. L. J. 395, 417 (1986). Indeed, Hydrolevel 
and many other trade association cases have focused on this role and on associations' standard-setting or industry-regulating 
activities. See e.g.  Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery & Printing Co., 472 U.S. 284, 86 L. Ed. 2d 202, 
105 S. Ct. 2613 (1985); Moore v. Boating Industry Assoc., 819 F.2d 693 (7th Cir. 1987). See generally ABA Antitrust Section, 
Antitrust Law Developments 86-91 (3d ed. 1992). Notably, the case before us does not involve standard-setting or industry-
regulating activity on NDPA's part."
176,11," There is, however, authority for the proposition that a trade association, in and of itself, is a unit of joint action sufficient to 
constitute a section 1 combination. See G.D. Webster, The Law of Associations § 9a.01[1], 9A3-4 (1991) (""There is no question 
that an association is a 'combination' within the meaning of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Although a conspiracy requires more 
than one person, an association, by its very nature a group, satisfies the requirement of joint action. Thus, any association 
activity which restrains interstate commerce can be violative of Section 1 even if no one acts in concert with the association.""); 
Stephanie W. Kanwit, FTC Enforcement Efforts Involving Trade and Professional Associations, 46 Antitrust L.J. 640, 640 (1977) 
(""Because trade associations are, by definition, organizations of competitors, they automatically satisfy the combination 
requirements of § 1 of the Sherman Act."") "
177,12," We do not, however, require that members of NDPA actually ratify an agent's actions before NDPA may be held liable for 
them. Such a rule not only would be unrealistic, see supra note 9, but it also would contravene the Court's admonition that 
agents of trade associations acting with apparent authority exercise the associations' economic power regardless of whether 
they are acting to benefit the associations.  Hydrolevel, 456 U.S. at 573-74. "
178,13," In Matsushita, the Supreme Court, in the context of an alleged horizontal price-fixing conspiracy, ruled that the case should not 
proceed to trial because the petitioners lacked a rational motive to conspire in the manner alleged. It also noted, however, that 
its ruling was not meant to ""imply that, if petitioners had had a plausible reason to conspire, ambiguous conduct could suffice to 
create a triable issue of conspiracy. Our decision in Monsanto . . . establishes that conduct that is as consistent with permissible 
competition as with illegal conspiracy does not, without more, support even an inference of conspiracy."" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 
597 n.21. "
184,14," For the reasons explained in the court's opinion, the agency principles discussed in American Soc'y of Mechanical Eng'rs v. 
Hydrolevel Corp., 456 U.S. 556, 72 L. Ed. 2d 330, 102 S. Ct. 1935 (1982), and the Supreme Court's application of those 
principles in that case are not pertinent until a violation of section 1 has been established. "
185,15," I express no opinion on whether the activities the defendants are accused of engaging in constitute an unreasonable restraint 
of trade within the meaning of section 1 of the Sherman Act. "
193,1," These background facts are taken from Plaintiffs' complaint, which the Court assumes as true when considering a Motion to 
Dismiss. "
195,2," Prior to enactment of the FTAIA, courts followed a tripartite test: 1) the effect or intended effect on the foreign commerce of the 
United States; (2) the type and magnitude of the alleged illegal behavior; and (3) the appropriateness of exercising extraterritorial 
jurisdiction in light of considerations of international comity and fairness. Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of America, 549 F.2d 
597, 613-15 (9th Cir. 1976) (Timberlane I); Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of America, 574 F. Supp. 1453, 1463-67 (N.D. Cal. 
1983), aff'd, 749 F.2d 1378 (9th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 472 U.S. 1032, 87 L. Ed. 2d 643, 105 S. Ct. 3514, (1985) (Timberlane 
II); see also Liamuiga Tours, Div. of Caribbean Tourism Consultants, Ltd. v. Travel Impressions, Ltd., 617 F. Supp. 920, 923 
(E.D.N.Y. 1985). "
196,3," While the In Porters court referred to 15 U.S.C. § 6(a) as the ""Export Act"", it is synonymous in the instant case with ""FTAIA."""
196,4," The Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15, gives the right to bring suit in federal court to ""any person who shall be injured in his business 
or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws."""
196,5," In their Complaint, Plaintiffs allege various violations of § 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2, which states: ""Every person 
who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any 
part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on 
conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $ 10,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any other person, $ 350,000, or 
by imprisonment not exceeding three years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court."""
196,6," Plaintiffs' Complaint, P 1. "
199,7," Although the Hammes case involves an interstate commerce antitrust case and we declined earlier to look to interstate 
commerce cases to determine the domestic effect required, we find this particular interstate commerce case to be controlling on 
how detailed federal pleadings must be. The substantive law on the elements of a particular claim is different for international 
antitrust cases than interstate cases, as is demonstrated by the FTAIA, which imposes a special standard for pleading for foreign "
200,," antitrust cases. On the other hand, the law on procedural issues remains relatively the same, regardless of the type of dispute 
involved."
200,8," Although § 6a has become the ""test"" for jurisdiction over international antitrust matters, considerations of comity are still 
considered. McGlinchy v. Shell Chemical Co., 845 F.2d 802, 814 (9th Cir. 1988). However, we need not address that issue in 
the instant case as we do not reach the question. "
205,1," HN1[
] R.C. 1331 governs the regulation of monopolies.  R.C. 1333.51 prohibits the conversion of trade secrets. "
214,1," The court will not address the arguments that were addressed for the first time in Dominican's response to the court's tentative 
order. "
218,2," Cargill does not rule out the possibility that a competitor could possibly allege a threat of antitrust injury from the possibility of 
future predation by a competitor that gained market power through a merger. "
231,1," Defendants have continuously objected to the use of the term ""pay"" in its various forms on the theory that Blue Cross is not a 
purchaser of physician services and argue for use of the term ""remit"". This is a distinction without a difference in both common 
usage and case law. Accordingly, their objection is denied. "
233,2, Neither party alleges that Blue Cross is a competitor for this purpose. 
234,3," This Court notes that the Seventh Circuit has interpreted antitrust injury narrowly and is aware of the Supreme Court's holding, 
""'the statute does not confine its protection to consumers, or to purchasers, or to competitors, or to sellers…The Act is 
comprehensive in its terms and coverage protecting all who are made victims of the forbidden practices by whomever they may 
be perpetrated.'"" Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 472, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149, 102 S. Ct. 2540 (1982) quoting 
Mandeville Island Farms, Inc. v. American Crystal Sugar Co., 334 U.S. 219, 236, 92 L. Ed. 1328, 68 S. Ct. 996 (1948). Whether 
or not the Seventh Circuit has interpreted the relevant law to provide for a rule of general application that only consumers, 
buyers and purchasers may suffer antitrust injury is not relevant for our purposes because this Court finds Blue Cross to be a 
purchaser of physician services. "
238,4," Defendants missed a logical step in their argument. Defendants launch directly into a discussion of the relevant market without 
explaining its significance. To establish a claim under section 2, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant has monopoly "
239,," power. Defining the relevant market helps to make this determination. A defendant may have monopoly power in one product 
market but not another."
239,5," Because the Court rejected defendants' argument that the relevant market is health care financing, this Court need not address 
defendants' argument that defendants do not have monopoly power in the health care financing market. "
246,1," Price and Price Heneveld have filed a consolidated motion to dismiss. Ralston Purina has filed a separate motion. However, 
Price and Price Heneveld's motion incorporates by reference all of Ralston Purina's arguments. Accordingly, this opinion refers 
to Ralston Purina's arguments as defendants' arguments. "
250,2," Because defendants' standing and limitations arguments warrant dismissal, there is no need to address Price and Price 
Heneveld's res judicata contention or defendants' argument that the RICO counts fail to properly identify a criminal enterprise 
and to allege cognizable predicate acts. "
251,3," Northern Trust alleges that its expenses in defending the suit brought against it by Bunge constitute ""continuing antitrust 
injury."" However, litigation expenses incurred after an overt act do not extend the statute of limitations for antitrust claims. See Al 
George, Inc. v. Envirotech Corp., 939 F.2d 1271, 1274-75 (5th Cir. 1991); Pace Industries, Inc. v. Three Phoenix Co., 813 F.2d 
234, 238-39 (9th Cir. 1987)."
251,4," Because Northern Trust's lack of standing and the expiration of the limitations period compel dismissal, there is no need to 
address Price and Price Heneveld's res judicata argument. "
252,5," Northern Trust argues that its cause of action did not accrue until the amount it owed Lauhoff was determined by the Vermillion 
County Court. However, under Illinois law, a cause of action exists once a plaintiff is aware that it has sustained some damage, 
even if the extent of damage must be determined later. See Nelligan v. Tom Chaney Motors, Inc., 133 Ill. App. 3d 798, 479 
N.E.2d 439, 443, 88 Ill. Dec. 826 (1985); In Re Josefik, 72 Bankr. 393, 398 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 1987) (applying Illinois law). "
253,6," Because Counts VII-IX are time-barred, there is no need to address Price and Price Heneveld's res judicata argument or 
defendants' contentions that Northern Trust has failed to adequately allege fraud and unfair competition. "
257,1," This Court previously dismissed all counts of Plaintiff's Complaint for failure to state a claim.  Tri-State Rubbish v. Waste 
Management, 803 F. Supp. 451 (D. Me. 1992). The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the decision with 
respect to Defendants Mid-Maine Waste Action Corporation (MMWAC) and the city of Auburn, but remanded the remaining 
counts, permitting this Court ""to demand more specific explanations from Tri-State as to the gray areas"" in its claims for relief 
against Waste Management, Inc and Waste Management of Maine (collectively referred to as WMI).  Tri-State Rubbish v. Waste 
Management, 998 F.2d 1073 (1st Cir. 1993). Thus, WMI is the only remaining Defendant in this litigation. "
258,2," MMWAC is a nonprofit, nonstock corporation created pursuant to an interlocal agreement and Maine law which encourages 
municipalities to cooperate in waste disposal projects. 38 M.R.S.A. § 2201. The entity was created to construct and operate a 
trash-to-energy facility to dispose of the member towns' waste. See, Tri-State Rubbish, 998 F.2d at 1075. The MMWAC member 
towns are Auburn, Monmouth, Sweden, Minot, Poland, Sumner, Wales, Buckfield, Bowdoin, Lovell, New Gloucester, and 
Raymond. "
259,3," HN3[
] The federal statute provides: ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire 
with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign 
nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony . . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 2."
259,4," There is conflict among the circuits as to the relevant measure of a defendant's costs.  Brooke Group, Ltd. v. Brown & 
Williamson Tobacco Corp., 125 L. Ed. 2d 168, 186 n.1, 113 S. Ct. 2578. The First Circuit follows a ""variable cost"" approach.  Tri-
State Rubbish, 998 F.2d at 1080. "
260,5," The time period at issue in the Barry Wright case was three years, the same as the contracts complained of here. Barry Wright 
Corp. v. ITT Grinnell Corp., 724 F.2d 227, 237 (1st Cir. 1983). "
261,6," Apparently, not all of WMI's customers were required to sign such contracts, but the materials submitted to this Court fail to 
specify how many WMI customers actually signed the contracts and whether any continued to seek competitive prices from 
other haulers."
261,7," It is not disputed that TSR obtained at least 32 additional commercial waste customers in 1991, 28 in 1992, and 96 in 1993. It 
is also not disputed that TSR produced a profit in both 1991 and 1992, although not in 1993. The record contains information 
that is subject to confidentiality orders and agreements which clearly indicates that TSR enjoys a robust economic position which 
enhances its competitive abilities. In addition, TSR did recover some of the accounts previously lost to WMI. "
264,1," Plaintiff has brought both a federal antitrust claim under § 1 of the Sherman Act and an antitrust claim under West Virginia 
state law. (Complaint at PP29-38). West Virginia courts, however, interpret actions brought pursuant to the state's antitrust 
statute in a manner consistent with federal decisions interpreting the Sherman Act. Gray v. Marshall County Board of Education, "
265,179," W. Va. 282, 367 S.E.2d 751, 755 (W.V. 1988). Therefore, the Court's analysis of defendant's arguments in support of its 
motion to dismiss plaintiff's federal antitrust claim also applies to the motion to dismiss the state antitrust claim."
265,2," Defendant correctly notes that the Court in Perma Life left open the question of whether ""truly complete involvement"" in an 
alleged illegal scheme could bar plaintiff from recovering under the antitrust laws. Id. at 140. In the instant case, however, 
plaintiff has alleged that it was coerced into the illegal agreement by threats from the defendant. (Complaint at P21). Therefore, 
plaintiff's involvement in the alleged conspiracy cannot be characterized as ""truly complete."""
265,3," Federal antitrust law differentiates between two types of concerted activity: (1) horizontal conspiracies, and (2) vertical 
conspiracies. Horizontal conspiracies exist when the alleged co-conspirators are in direct competition with one another, whereas 
vertical conspiracies contemplate an agreement between firms at different levels in the distribution chain (e.g., supplier and 
distributor). Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 730, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808, 108 S. Ct. 1515 and n. 
4 (1988). The classification is important because in certain circumstances, different antitrust standards apply to each type. "
266,," Defendant emphasizes the fact that it is a ""dual distributor,"" competing directly in the road salt market and selling road salt to 
distributors. Defendant claims that while as a dual distributor, it had both a horizontal and a vertical relationship with plaintiff, as 
a matter of law, the Court should classify their relationship as vertical. Defendant's at 5-6). However, the Court is aware that the 
parties' relationship has both vertical and horizontal elements and will not rule as a matter of law that their relationship is strictly 
vertical because that determination is not necessary to the resolution of the issues before this Court."
266,4," Defendant asserts that no price fixing occurred in this case because plaintiff made no sales at the price allegedly suggested by 
defendant. (Reply brief at 7-8). However, the fact that plaintiff made no sales at the agreed upon price does not mean that 
plaintiff and defendant did not illegally agree to set prices."
266,5," Section 4 of the Clayton Act states that ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reasons of anything 
forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue…."" 15 U.S.C. § 15 (emphasis added). "
267,6," Defendant also claims that plaintiff's alleged injury--profits lost from its inability to bid competitively on the WVDOT contracts--is 
too speculative to constitute harm to competition. (Defendant's brief at 12 n. 14). However, courts have recognized that lost 
profits may constitute antitrust injury when a party is not allowed to participate in the market due to a defendant's antitrust 
violations. See, e.g., Delong Equipment Co. v. Washington Mills Electro Minerals Corp., 990 F.2d 1186, 1199 (11th Cir.), cert. 
denied, 126 L. Ed. 2d 569, 114 S. Ct. 604 (1993) (sufficient antitrust injury where plaintiff lost the opportunity to compete); 
Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 116, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427, 107 S. Ct. 484 (1986) (lost profits from antitrust 
violation recoverable). While plaintiff must prove that it would have won the WVDOT contracts to recover from defendant, at this 
stage of the proceedings, the Court will not deny plaintiff the opportunity to make this showing."
267,7," Defendant asserts that this Court should exercise its ""inherent supervisory powers"" to compel plaintiff to provide a copy of the 
contract for purposes of deciding defendant's motion to dismiss. (Defendant's reply brief at 9-10). The Court finds defendant's 
suggestion curious because defendant was also a party to the contract and has not itself provided this Court with a copy of their 
agreement. "
268,8," Because the parties appear to implicitly agree on the applicable choice of law, this Court will not challenge their decision. See, 
e.g., Schiavone Construction Co. v. Time, Inc., 735 F.2d 94, 96 (3d Cir. 1984). "
273,1," When the singular ""defendant"" is used in this opinion, it refers to the corporate defendant. "
274,2, We note that plaintiff's complaint here was dismissed with prejudice. 
275,3," This section would have appeared in the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 762 through 765 (1977), but the editors determined 
that it more properly belonged in the area of unfair competition which was to be covered in its own Restatement. The 
introduction to the Restatement (Second) of Torts, Division 9, (1977) states that ""these topics are all within the general field of 
Trade Regulation rather than Torts, and . . . the decision has therefore been made to delete them. . . ."" The Restatement of the 
Law Unfair Competition is now in draft form, approved at the May 19, 1993 meeting of The American Law Institute. 
Unfortunately, the subject of § 762 was also not included in this new Restatement. This leaves us, therefore, with the language 
of the 1939 Restatement which is recognized in New Jersey case law. "
277,4," As noted in D'Agostino v. Johnson & Johnson, Inc., 133 N.J. at 527, 628 A.2d 305: ""Courts do not create their own public 
policy."" . . . We look to legislation, professional codes of ethics, court decisions, and the like. Pierce v. Ortho Pharmaceutical 
Corp., 84 N.J. at 72, 417 A.2d 505. In the absence of legislation, the courts ""must define the cause of action in case-by-case 
determinations."" Ibid."
277,5," The closest criminal law apparently is the felony defined in the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.A. § 2. Federal law also defines the 
public policy of New Jersey. See D'Agostino v. Johnson & Johnson, Inc., 133 N.J. at 528, 628 A.2d 305. "
279,6," Standing has been expanded beyond the injured competitor. A buyer or seller in the affected market also would have standing. 
Comet Mechanical Contractors, Inc. v. E.A. Cowen Constr., Inc., 609 F.2d at 406. See New Jersey Chiropractic Soc'y v. 
Radiological Soc'y of New Jersey, 156 N.J. Super. 365, 371, 383 A.2d 1182 (Ch. Div.1978) (holding that consumers had 
standing to sue in State antitrust cases when they ""suffered injury to their 'property.'"") "
282,*, Hon. Myron L. Gordon of the Eastern District of Wisconsin. 
290,1," In Count I of his complaint, Wheeler alleges that he had an exclusive distributorship contract with Rivenite Corporation and that 
Mobil induced Rivenite to breach the contract causing Wheeler loss of economic expectancy. Mobil's motion to dismiss this 
count is denied without prejudice to its right to file a properly supported motion for summary judgment on the same grounds. In 
addition, Mobil agreed to allow the plaintiff to amend the complaint to name the correct defendant. Therefore, Mobil's motion to 
dismiss on that ground need not be addressed. "
291,2," HN3[
] To state a claim for unreasonable, nonprice, vertical restraint, a plaintiff must show (1) an agreement among two or 
more business entities or persons, (2) which is intended to harm or unreasonably restrain competition, and (3) which actually 
causes injury to competition. Quaker State Corp. v. Leavitt, 839 F. Supp. 76, 80 (D. Mass. 1983); see also, Les Shockley Racing 
v. National Hot Rod Ass'n, 884 F.2d 504, 507 (9th Cir. 1989). "

302,1," Genentech states that the '877 patent specifically describes an intricate and technical method that allegedly would enable a 
person of ordinary skill in the recombinant DNA field to induce bacteria to produce a medically useful human hormone. The 
method reportedly involves the isolation of human or animal messenger RNA coding for the production of a specific hormone 
from a cell that ordinarily produces the hormone; reverse transcribing the RNA to produce cDNA, a copy of the isolated RNA; 
inserting the copy into a transfer vector; and transforming bacteria to replicate the cDNA."
302,2," In this Court's May 2, 1994, Entry, we referred to the governmental agency providing funding for UC's research as the 
Department of Health, Education and Welfare (the HEW). See Granting in Part and Denying in Part Lilly's Motion to Dismiss 
Counts II-V and VII-VIII of Genentech's Amended Complaint, IP-90-1679C (S.D. Ind. May 2, 1994). The parties in their papers 
filed with the Court had referred to the agency as the HEW. In Lilly's opposition to the instant motion, however, it refers to the 
agency as the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Lilly explains that the HEW was the predecessor 
agency to the HHS, and that the agency was the HHS at the time of the events giving rise to Genentech's allegations against UC 
and Lilly. Nonetheless, because all references to the agency in our previous Entry were to the HEW, we continue to refer to the 
agency as the HEW in today's Entry. "

] The regents may acquire by grant, purchase, gift, devise, lease, or by the exercise of the right of eminent domain, 
and may hold, use, sell, lease, or dispose of any real or personal property necessary for the full exercise or convenient or 
useful for the carrying on of any of its powers pursuant to this chapter. Cal. Educ. Code § 92432 stipulates: HN6[
] The regents may construct, own, operate, and control any project. Cal. Educ. Code § 92437 provides: HN7[
] The regents may make contracts, leases, and agreements with any person or public corporation, political 
subdivision, city, county, district, or any agency of any person or such entity and may generally perform all acts necessary 
for the full exercise of the powers vested in the regents. "
307,4," As our previous discussion explains, Genentech cannot maintain an antitrust claim against UC in this cause of action. Thus, 
references to UC's conduct in this context is significant only in describing fully the factual allegations supporting Genentech's 
antitrust claims against Lilly. "
308,5," Executive Order 12,591 is denominated ""Facilitating Access to Science and Technology"" and is dated April 10, 1987. Lilly Ex. 
6. Executive Order 12,618 is designated ""Uniform Treatment of Federally Funded Inventions"" and is dated December 22, 1987. 
The latter Executive Order added a new subsection to the former, which subsection in relevant part provided: (b) The head of each Executive department and agency shall, within overall funding allocations and to the extent permitted 
by law: . . . (5) administer all patents and licenses to inventions made with federal assistance, which are owned by the non-profit 
contractor or grantee, in accordance with Section 202(c)(7) of Title 35 of the United States Code as amended by Public 
Law 98-620, without regard to limitations on licensing found in that section prior to amendment or in Institutional Patent 
Agreements now in effect that were entered into before that law was enacted on November 8, 1984, unless, in the case of 
an invention that has not been marketed, the funding agency determines, based on information in its files, that the 
contractor or grantee has not taken adequate steps to market the inventions, in accordance with applicable law or an 
Institutional Patent Agreement; . . . . Exec. Order No. 12,618, 52 Fed. Reg. 48,661, 1987 WL 181454 (Dec. 22, 1987). "
309,6," In a May 2, 1994, Entry, this Court found that Genentech had stated an antitrust claim against Lilly based on allegations of 
fraud on the PTO. "
310,7," The Irons opinion was one of many documents that was the subject of an Entry this Court issued regarding inadvertently 
produced documents. See Entry Denying UC's Motion for Return of Inadvertently Produced Documents; Denying Genentech's 
Emergency Motion to Compel the Return of Inadvertently Produced Documents; and Granting in Part and Denying in Part Lilly's 
Motion to Compel the Return of Inadvertently Produced Privileged Documents, Docket No. 912 (S.D. Ind. March 22, 1994). In 
that Entry, the Court denied, inter alia, UC's request for return of that document. "
311,8," Fact discovery in this case currently is slated to close on November 30, 1994. "
313,9, This Order established a schedule for the completion of the pretrial phase of these consolidated civil actions. 
316,10," As we held in our May 2, 1994, Entry, a determination of whether Genentech was indeed an intended third-party beneficiary 
under the 1978 option agreement is reserved for a later date. "
317,11," Our determination that this claim is permissive rather than compulsory makes it unnecessary for us to consider UC's statute of 
limitations argument or the propriety of permitting amendment pursuant to Genentech's supplement to paragraph 38 of its 
proposed Second Amended Complaint. Such supplement apparently was designed to ensure that Genentech properly had 
illustrated in its proposed Second Amended Complaint that the statute of limitations was not a bar to Genentech's claim of 
breach of the 1980 settlement agreement. "
318,12," Genentech has moved the Court for permission to file one reply memorandum in response to both UC's and Lilly's opposition 
to the instant motion, which reply memorandum is in excess of the page limitation established in Local Rule 7.1. The Court 
grants Genentech's motion. However, Lilly's motion for leave to file a surreply memorandum in opposition to Genentech's motion 
for leave further to amend its Amended Complaint is denied. No further briefing was necessary for purposes of this Entry. "
330,1," Counsel for Curtis and Judd request oral argument in order to address the particulars of the instant motion. Standard practice 
under the local rules is for motions to be decided ""without oral argument on the basis of papers filed."" Local Rule 11(g). Further, 
in its discretion the court may allow oral argument ""after consideration of a written statement by counsel outlining the unusual 
reasons why oral argument"" would be of assistance to the court. Id. (emphasis added). The court finds that in light of the volume 
of papers filed in conjunction with the instant motion, oral argument is unnecessary to a proper determination of the motion. 
Therefore, the request for oral argument must be and herewith is denied. "
331,2," Since the April 4, 1994, Order of Consolidation denominated Civil No. 89-430-SD as the main case, Curtis and Judd will 
hereinafter be referred to as ""plaintiffs"", and Plasti-Clip and Faneuf will hereinafter be referred to as ""defendants."" "
334,3," This comparison itself may involve a two-step process: First, it must be determined whether the accused structure literally 
infringes the claims. Second, if there is no literal infringement, the doctrine of equivalents must be applied to determine whether 
the accused device performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way for substantially the same purpose. 
See Aid Pack, Inc. v. Beecham, Inc., 641 F. Supp. 692, 694 (D. Mass. 1986), aff'd without opinion, 826 F.2d 1071 (Fed. Cir. 
1987)."
334,4," Dividing the analysis into this dichotomy was mandated by the Supreme Court as early as Winans v. Denmead, 56 U.S. (15 
How.) 330, 14 L. Ed. 717 (1854). In this regard, the Court noted, "
335,," Two questions arise. The first is, what is the thing patented; the second, has that thing been constructed, used, or sold by the 
defendants. The first is a question of law, to be determined by the court, construing the letters-patent, and the description of the invention 
and specification of claim annexed to them. The second is a question of fact, to be submitted to a jury. Id. at 338 (emphasis added)."
335,5," This is not to say that simple disagreement over the meaning of a term in a claim rises to the level of a factual dispute sufficient 
to prevent summary judgment. See Johnston v. IVAC Corp., 885 F.2d 1574, 1579-80 (Fed. Cir. 1989). In such an instance, the 
court should attempt to resolve the facial conflict through resort to the prosecution and specification history or other extrinsic 
evidence.  Id. at 1579. If, however, the underlying probative evidence continues to be susceptible to genuine evidentiary conflict, 
the resolution of which can only be resolved by way of expert testimony or complex scientific principles, then the term is 
considered an issue of fact, and summary judgment is inappropriate. Id. (citing Howes v. Medical Components, Inc., 814 F.2d 
638, 643 (Fed Cir. 1987)). "
337,6," Direct infringement is defined under section 271(a) as follows: HN20[
] ""Except as otherwise provided in this title, whoever 
without authority makes, uses or sells any patented invention, within the United States during the term of the patent therefor, 
infringes the patent."" 35 U.S.C. § 271(a)."
337,7," 35 U.S.C. § 271(b) provides, HN21[
] ""Whoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringer."" "
338,8," The inability of the parties to schedule and take Judd's deposition does no violence to the validity of defendants' allegations. 
Proof of ""knowingly induced"" infringement by ""circumstantial evidence is not only sufficient, but may also be more certain, 
satisfying and persuasive than direct evidence."" Moleculon Research Corp. v. CBS, Inc., 793 F.2d 1261, 1272 (Fed. Cir. 1986), 
cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1030, 107 S. Ct. 875, 93 L. Ed. 2d 829 (1987) (quoting Michalic v. Cleveland Tankers, Inc., 364 U.S. 325, 
330, 81 S. Ct. 6, 5 L. Ed. 2d 20 (1960)). "
341,9," Moreover, Judd's status as the assignor of the '078 patent does not insulate him from potential infringement liability. See Rohm 
& Haas, supra, 718 F. Supp. at 331-32 (assignor of patents who encouraged and induced assignee activities infringing existing 
patent can be liable under 35 U.S.C. § 271(b)). "
342,10," Equitable title has been defined as ""the beneficial interest of one person whom equity regards as the real owner, although the 
legal title is vested in another."" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1486 (6th ed. 1990)."
342,11," Although the practical effect of such a finding may result in the assignment of a void patent, see Wise v. Hubbard, 769 F.2d 1, 
3 (1st Cir. 1985) (citing Kennedy v. Hazelton, 128 U.S. 667, 672, 9 S. Ct. 202, 32 L. Ed. 576 (1888)), the Supreme Court has 
admonished that ""establishing a fact and giving a specific effect to it by judgment are quite distinct."" Becher v. Contoure Labs., 
Inc., 279 U.S. 388, 391, 49 S. Ct. 356, 73 L. Ed. 752 (1928). "
343,12," To the extent that the statute and New Hampshire caselaw provide little insight, consultation with both federal and 
Massachusetts precedent is encouraged. See RSA 358-A:13 (courts should ""be guided by the interpretation and construction 
given Section 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1)), by the Federal Trade Commission and the 
Federal courts""); see also Chase, supra, 122 N.H. at 602, 448 A.2d at 391-92 (New Hampshire invited to utilize interpretive 
comparisons with the ""well developed"" caselaw construing the analogous Massachusetts ""unfair and deceptive practices act,"" 
Mass. Gen Laws. ch. 93A). "
344,13," The cases cited by plaintiffs in their brief are inapposite and provide little assistance toward resolution of the issue, since all 
involved a delay of greater than two years between the offending incidents and the filing of any complaint or counterclaim. See, 
e.g., Zee-Bar, supra, 792 F. Supp. at 895 (3 1/2 years elapsed); Lerer v. Ultra Scan, Inc., 770 F. Supp. 51 (D.N.H. 1990) (3 
years elapsed); City of Manchester v. National Gypsum Co., 637 F. Supp. 646 (D.R.I. 1986) (8 years elapsed). But cf. Gilmore v. 
Bradgate Assoc., Inc., No. 89-189-D, slip op. at 5 (D.N.H. July 27, 1990) (17-month lapse insufficient to bar action). "
345,14," Despite the fact that the Supreme Court has noted, in dictum, that summary judgment procedures, especially in complex 
antitrust actions, should be used cautiously when motive and intent are integral elements of the cause of action, see Poller v. 
Columbia Broadcasting Sys., Inc., 368 U.S. 464, 491, 82 S. Ct. 486, 7 L. Ed. 2d 458 (1962), most courts, including the Supreme 
Court, are now less hesitant to apply the customary summary judgment standard in antitrust cases. See, e.g., Matsushita Elec. 
Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). The First Circuit ""specifically has 
rejected special summary judgment treatment in antitrust cases, holding that the particular circumstances involved are what 
control."" Texaco Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Medina, 834 F.2d 242, 247 (1st Cir. 1987) (citing White v. Hearst Corp., 669 F.2d 14, 17 
(1st Cir. 1982)). "
346,15," The court notes here in passing that ""[a] patent by its very nature is affected with a public interest. . . . [It] is an exception to the general rule against monopolies and 
to the right to access to a free and open market. The far-reaching social and economic consequences of a patent, therefore, give 
the public a paramount interest in seeing that patent monopolies spring from backgrounds free from fraud or other inequitable 
conduct and that such monopolies are kept within their legitimate scope."" Walker Process, supra, 382 U.S. at 177 (quoting Precision Instrument Mfg. Co. v. Automotive Maintenance Mach. Co., 324 U.S. 
806, 816, 65 S. Ct. 993, 89 L. Ed. 1381 (1945)). "
347,16," ""Because market power is often inferred from market share, market definition generally determines the result of the case."" 
Kodak, supra, ___ U.S. at ___, 112 S. Ct. at 2083 n.15."
347,17," The First Circuit has previously commented on the market definition quandary, noting that there is no subject in antitrust law more confusing than market definition. One reason is that the concept, even in the pristine 
formulation of economists, is deliberately an attempt to oversimplify--for working purposes --the very complex economic 
interactions between a number of differently situated buyers and sellers, each of whom in reality has different costs, needs, and 
substitutes. See United States v. E.I. du Pont De Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 76 S. Ct. 994, 100 L. Ed. 1264 (1956). Further, 
when lawyers and judges take hold of the concept, they impose on it nuances and formulas that reflect administrative and "
348,," antitrust policy goals. This adaption is legitimate (economists have no patent on the concept), but it means that normative and 
descriptive ideas become intertwined in the process of market definition. U.S. Healthcare, supra, 986 F.2d at 598. Given the ultimate disposition of the antitrust inquiry, the court is satisfied with 
defendants' asserted market definition."
348,18," Based on the facts and circumstances presently before the court, unless defendants can demonstrate that Curtis held 50 
percent or more of the United States domestic market, their antitrust claims will fail as a matter of law. See, e.g., Advanced 
Health-Care Servs. v. Giles Memorial Hosp., 846 F. Supp. 488, 497 (W.D. Va. 1994) (""Where, as in this case, evidence of intent 
and predatory conduct is weak and entry barriers are low, the plaintiff must show a market share above 50 percent to show a 
'dangerous probability of success.'""); M & M Medical Supplies & Serv., Inc. v. Pleasant Valley Hosp., Inc., 981 F.2d 160, 168 (4th 
Cir. 1992), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 113 S. Ct. 2962, 125 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1993) (claims involving less than a 50 percent 
market share should usually be rejected, ""except where conduct is very likely to achieve monopoly or where conduct is 
invidious""); Barr Labs., Inc. v. Abbott Labs., 978 F.2d 98, 112-15 (3d Cir. 1992) (defendant's 50 percent market share insufficient 
to show dangerous probability of success)."
348,19," In the complaint, defendants asserted antitrust violations under both federal and state law. To the extent that the New 
Hampshire Legislature has encouraged the uniform construction of RSA 356 (Combinations & Monopolies) with federal antitrust 
law, any determination of liability under the state statute is likewise deferred. See RSA 356:14; U.S. Healthcare, supra, 986 F.2d 
at 599. "
349,20," Plaintiffs further alleged that defendants' claims of conversion were preempted by operation of 35 U.S.C. §§ 116 (Inventors) 
and 256 (Correction of named inventor). This federal scheme for the correction of patents only applies when a joint inventor has 
not been named in the application through error which arises without any deceptive intention on the part of the named inventor. 
See 35 U.S.C. §§ 116, 256. Since the record clearly indicates that such error was not due to mere inadvertence, the court finds 
said sections of title 35 to be inapplicable in the present dispute."
349,21," The court pauses here to note that although plaintiffs are correct in their assertion that conversion of an intangible right has 
been applied to the conversion of bank books, bonds, checks, and the like, ""such documents do not constitute an all-inclusive 
catalogue of those to which the rule stated in [] Section [242] is applicable . . . . The law is evidently undergoing a process of 
expansion, the ultimate limits of which cannot as yet be determined."" RESTATEMENT, supra, § 242 cmt. b."
349,22," At least one court has indicated that the inquiry should focus ""on what proof is necessary to establish the existence of the 
allegedly converted property; not the form it has taken or its identification within a larger quantity of identical property."" Northcraft 
v. Edward C. Michener Assocs., Inc., 319 Pa. Super. 432, 466 A.2d 620, 625 (Pa. Super. 1983) (holding that cause of action "
350,," exists for wrongfully retained plans and specifications, but suggested that more amenable cause of action would lie for breach of 
contract or misrepresentation). See also 7 STUART M. SPEISER, ET AL, THE AMERICAN LAW OF TORTS § 24:5, at 715 
(1990) (noting paucity of authority on subject). "
360,1, See Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment at 2. 
361,2, See Plaintiffs Exh. 12 & 13.
361,3," Defendant Valley Rich and Flav-O-Rich also argue that the transcript of the hearing is itself inadmissible hearsay. This 
argument is not well-taken. See United States v. Brooks, 296 U.S. App. D.C. 219, 966 F.2d 1500, 1505 (D.C. Cir. 1992): 4 
Weinstein on Evidence P 804(b)(1)[01], at 804-87. The case Valley Rich cites is clearly distinguishable for there the proponent of 
the evidence did not advance any additional exception that would allow the statements contained in the transcript to be admitted. 
See Trustees of the Univ. of Pa. v. Lexington Ins. Co., 815 F.2d 890, 905 (3d Cir. 1987). "
362,4," Indeed, Conmar involved facts that tended to show a cover-up, as the most stringent test would require. In that case, the 
defendant issued a press release after the government released the affidavit of a customs officer in charge of the investigation. 
The press release stated that the investigation was based on a misunderstanding and misrepresentation of customs regulations. 
Conmar, 858 F.2d at 505."
362,5," See Conmar, 858 F.2d at 505 (false press release an affirmative act of concealment)."
362,6," Apparently silence or failure to own up to wrongdoing would not satisfy the Fifth Circuit's intermediate standard unless there 
was an affirmative denial on which the plaintiff could reasonably rely. Allan Construction, 851 F.2d at 1532. "
363,7," As the plaintiff points out, Screws did go on to admit the testimony under the residual exception. My citation of Screws here 
does not imply support for the court's conclusion with respect to the residual exception. As will be discussed more extensively 
below, under controlling Fourth Circuit precedent, I hold that there are not sufficient ""circumstantial guarantees of 
trustworthiness"" surrounding French's testimony. "
364,8," See Plaintiffs Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment at 12 n.5 (noting that state authorities 
could not use French's testimony in a criminal prosecution either)."
364,9," Cf. Gichner v. Antonio Troiano Tile & Marble Co., 133 U.S. App. D.C. 250, 410 F.2d 238, 241-43 (D.C. Cir. 1969) (holding that 
statement of person that he was smoking in building prior to destruction of that building by fire was statement against interest). 
Plaintiff relies upon this case in its opposition brief. But this case is distinguishable on two grounds. First, the plaintiff there 
sought to make the declarant a party to the lawsuit. This indicates that the prospect of civil liability was far more significant than 
here. Second, the declarant's statement exposed him to liability on negligence grounds. As I am about to discuss, this is far 
different than liability for a complex price-fixing scheme."
364,10," See Pink Supply, 612 F. Supp. at 1344-45. The case involved a vertical price-fixing conspiracy. The contents of the statement 
are disputed, but could have shown that the nonparty exerted pressure on one of the defendants to terminate their distributor 
agreement with the plaintiff because the plaintiff was discounting its prices too deeply and the nonparty, another distributor for 
defendant, wanted plaintiff cut off. Id. "
365,11, The brother was also a defendant charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine base.
365,12, See Plaintiff's Opposition Brief at 9-10. 
366,13," Even if I were to allow French's testimony in, it does not satisfy the separate and apart standard. As plaintiff admits in its brief, 
French never testified that ""'we acted as we did to conceal wrongdoing.'"" See Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition to 
Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment at 14. All French could testify to is the fact that secret meetings occurred. This 
merely demonstrates the fallibility of the intermediate standard because every price-fixing conspiracy will have similar secret 
meetings. "
367,1," Como más adelante se señala, a los fines de disponer de una moción de desestimación como la instada en el presente caso, 
estamos obligados a considerar como ciertas todas las alegaciones de la demanda."
367,2," PV pretendió comenzar este negocio en 1985. También demandaron Rafael J. Reboredo Pérez, Laureano Carus Abarca y 
Nilsa González de Carus, quienes eran accionistas, oficiales, directores de dicha corporación e invirtieron dinero, tiempo y 
esfuerzo en la gestión de negocios de PV. "
368,3," Martin Gas garantizó el cumplimiento del acuerdo por Puerto Rico Fuels. Dicho contrato fue firmado por Ramón González, 
""""dueño'' y presidente de Empire Gas. Se acompañó copia del acuerdo como Exhibit I dé la demanda."
368,4," En cuanto al centavo y medio de regalía, el contrato disponía, entre otras cosas, lo siguiente:"
368,1," . Puerto Rico Fuels … will pay Mr. Ramón González, Jr., … one and a half cent … per gallon for all liquified 
petroleum gas (L.P.G.) terminalled or transferred by it from vessel to any locátion within the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico. Said payment must be liquidated and made on the first … day of each month …"
368,2," . Empire Gas … agrees to purchase its liquified petroleum gas (L.P.G.) requirement from Puerto Rico Fuels, as 
available, up to 100%, provided however, that Empire Gas … will be entitled to purchase from any other source or 
supplier all amounts of L.P.G. not inmediately available at Puerto Rico Fuels terminal. All L.P.G. volumes above the 
100% requirements of Empire Gas … that must be moved from the terminal will not be the responsibility of Empire 
Gas … por Ramón González, Jr. and said volumes of L.P.G. will be sold jointly by Ramón González, Jr. and Puerto 
Rico Fuels with Ramón González, Jr. … retaining the aforementioned royalty of $0.0150 per gallón. "
372,5," El Tribunal Supremo federal ha determinado que cuatro tipos de conducta son irrazonables per se: 1) fijación de precios, 2) 
ciertos """"concerted refusals to deal'', 3) división horizontal del mercado y 4) """"tying arrangements''.  Sewell Plastics v. Coca-
Cola, 720 F.Supp. 1186, 1190 (1988). No se alega que alguna de estas prácticas esté envuelta en el presente caso. "
375,6, La sección 2(f) es más limitada ya que solamente se limita a prohibir el inducir o recibir un precio discriminatorio.
375,7," La primera oración corresponde a la segunda cláusula de la sección 2(a) de la Ley Robinson-Patman; según esté estatuto, la 
defensa sólo está disponible al que acusan de infringir dicha sección mientras que en Puerto Rico tal defensa parecería también 
estar disponible al que se acusa de infringir los artículos 7(b), 7(c) y 7(d) de nuestra ley, equivalentes a las secciones 2(d), 2(e) 
y 2(f) del estatuto federal. La segunda oración del artículo 7(e) corresponde a la segunda cláusula de la sección 2(b) de la Ley Robinson-Patman. "
377,8," Estos contratos se han definido como aquellos mediante los cuales """"the buyer will purchase, and [the] seller will supply, the 
buyer's requirements of particular goods at a specified price for a definite period of time.'' Stockhausen, The Commercial and 
Anti-Trust Aspects of Term Requirements Contracts. 28 N.Y.U. L.Q.R. 412 (1948). "
378,9," There are several reasons why it is pro-competitive to permit a manufacturer to limit the number of outlets that distribute its 
products. A few are readily apparent. First, when a manufacturer limits the number of its distributors, it may reduce its 
distribution costs by allowing each distributor to achieve economies of scale and to spread out fixed costs over a large amount of 
products. Second, refusals to deal may facilítate the entry of new mánufacturers into the market. The prospect of limited 
intrabrand competition that resuíts from restricted distribution may encourage distributors to make the investment necessary to 
carry a new manufacturer's product. Third, limiting the number of outlets that distribute a product may encourage distributors to 
provide promotional activities, consumer information, and product service. These activities may in turn lead to increased 
interbrand competition. When a manufacturer limits the number of retail outlets for its products, it ensures that competing sellers 
of its products will not get a """"free ride'', or benefit from the promotións or service provided by other distributors. Finally, 
restricting distribution can reduce transaction costs by permitting a manufacturer to deal only with distributors with whom it 
believes it can develop an efficent working relationship.  Westman, supra, a la pág. 1227. "
382,1," As stated further on, for purposes of settling a motion to dismiss like the one filed herein, we must consider as true all the 
allegations of the complaint."
382,2," PV tried to start this business in 1985. Also appearing as plaintiffs were Rafael J. Reboredo Pérez, Laureano Carus Abarca, 
and Nilsa González de Carus, who were PV shareholders, officers, and directors, and who had invested money, time, and effort 
into PV business ventures."
382,3," Martin Gas guaranteed Puerto Rico Fuels' performance of the agreement. Said contract was signed by Ramón González, 
""owner"" and president of Empire Gas. A copy of the agreement was attached to the complaint as Exhibit I."
382,4," With regard to the one and a half cent royalty, the contract provided, among other things, that: ""1. Puerto Rico Fuels . . . will pay Mr. Ramón González, Jr., . . . one and a half cent . . . per gallon for all liquified petroleum 
gas (L.P.G.) terminalled or transferred by it from vessel to any location within the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Said 
payment must be liquidated and made on the first . . . day of each month. . . . ""2. Empire Gas . . . agrees to purchase its liquified petroleum gas (L.P.G.) requirement from Puerto Rico Fuels, as 
available, up to 100%, provided however, that Empire Gas . . . will be entitled to purchase from any other source or supplier 
all amounts of L.P.G. not immediately available at Puerto Rico Fuels terminal. All L.P.G. volumes above the 100% 
requirements of Empire Gas . . . that must be moved from the terminal will not be the responsibility of Empire Gas . . . nor 
Ramón González, Jr. and said volumes of L.P.G. will be sold jointly by Ramón González, Jr. and Puerto Rico Fuels with 
Ramón González, Jr. . . . retaining the aforementioned royalty of $0.0150 per gallon."" "
385,5," The United States Supreme Court has ruled that there are four types of conduct that can be deemed unreasonable per se: (1) 
price-fixing, (2) certain concerted refusals to deal, (3) horizontal market division, and (4) tying arrangements. Sewell Plastics, 
Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co., 720 F. Supp. 1186, 1190 (1988). None of these practices have been alleged in the present case. "
388,6, Section 2(f) is more restricted inasmuch as it only prohibits anyone from inducing or receiving a discriminatory price.
388,7," The first sentence is equivalent to the second clause of section 2(a) of the Robinson-Patman Act. According to this statute, the 
defense is only available to anyone who violates said section, while in Puerto Rico the defense would also seem to be available 
to anyone accused of violating sec. 7(b), (c), and (d) of our statute, equivalent to federal sec. 2(d), (e), and (f). The second sentence of sec. 7(e) is equivalent to the second clause of Robinson-Patman Act sec. 2(b). "
390,8," These contracts have been defined as those whereby ""the buyer will purchase, and [the] seller will supply, the buyer's 
requirements of particular goods at a specified price for a definite period of time."" Stockhausen, The Commercial and Anti-Trust 
Aspects of Term Requirements Contracts, 28 N.Y.U. L.Q. Rev. 412 (1948). "
391,9," ""There are several reasons why it is procompetitive to permit a manufacturer to limit the number of outlets that distribute its 
products. A few are readily apparent. First, when a manufacturer limits the number of its distributors, it may reduce its 
distribution costs by allowing each distributor to achieve economies of scale and to spread out fixed costs over a large amount of 
products. . . . Second, refusals to deal may facilitate the entry of new manufacturers into the market. The prospect of limited 
intrabrand competition that results from restricted distribution may encourage distributors to make the investment necessary to 
carry a new manufacturer's product. . . . Third, limiting the number of outlets that distribute a product may encourage distributors 
to provide promotional activities, consumer information, and product service. These activities may in turn lead to increased 
interbrand competition. When a manufacturer limits the number of retail outlets for its products, it ensures that competing sellers 
of its product will not get a 'free ride,' or benefit from the promotions or service provided by other distributors. . . . Finally, 
restricting distribution can reduce transactions costs by permitting a manufacturer to deal only with distributors with whom it 
believes it can develop an efficient working relationship."" Westman Com'n Co. v. Hobart Intern., Inc., 796 F.2d 1216, 1227 (10th 
Cir. 1986). "
399,1," See Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment at 4, 10-12."
399,2," Defendant Valley Rich also argues that the transcript of the hearing is itself inadmissible hearsay. This argument is not well-
taken. See United States v. Brooks, 296 U.S. App. D.C. 219, 966 F.2d 1500, 1505 (D.C. Cir. 1992); 4 Weinstein on Evidence P 
804(b)(1)[01], at 804-87. The case Valley Rich cites is clearly distinguishable for there the proponent of the evidence did not 
advance any additional exception that would allow the statements contained in the transcript to be admitted. See Trustees of the 
Univ. of Pa. v. Lexington Ins. Co., 815 F.2d 890, 905 (3d Cir. 1987). "
400,3," Indeed, Conmar involved facts that tended to show a cover up, as the most stringent test would require. In that case, the 
defendant issued a press release after the government released the affidavit of a customs officer in charge of the investigation. 
The press release stated that the investigation was based on a misunderstanding and misinterpretation of customs regulations. 
Conmar, 858 F.2d at 505."
400,4," See Conmar, 858 F.2d at 505 (false press release an affirmative act of concealment)."
400,5," Apparently silence or failure to own up to wrongdoing would not satisfy the Fifth Circuit's intermediate standard unless there 
was an affirmative denial on which the plaintiff could reasonably rely. Allan Construction, 851 F.2d at 1532. "
401,6, Rodd Dep. at 199. Mr. Rodd is the West Virginia Deputy Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Department.
401,7," As the plaintiff points out, Screws did go on to admit the testimony under the residual exception. My citation of Screws here 
does not imply support for the court's conclusion with respect to the residual exception. As will be discussed more extensively 
below, under controlling Fourth Circuit precedent. I hold that there are not sufficient ""circumstantial guarantees of 
trustworthiness"" surrounding French's testimony. "
402,8," Cf. Gichner v. Antonio Troiano Tile & Marble Co., 133 U.S. App. D.C. 250, 410 F.2d 238, 241-43 (D.C. Cir. 1969) (holding that 
statement of person that he was smoking in building prior to destruction of that building by fire was statement against interest). 
Plaintiff relies upon this case in its opposition brief. But this case is distinguishable on two grounds. First, the plaintiff there 
sought to make the declarant a party to the lawsuit. This indicates that the prospect of civil liability was far more significant than 
here. Second, the declarant's statement exposed him to liability on negligence grounds. As I am about to discuss, this is far 
different than liability for a complex price-fixing scheme."
402,9," See Pink Supply, 612 F. Supp. at 1344-45. The case involved a vertical price-fixing conspiracy. The contents of the statement 
are disputed, but could have shown that the nonparty exerted pressure on one of the defendants to terminate their distributor 
agreement with the plaintiff because the plaintiff was discounting its prices too deeply and the nonparty, another distributor for 
defendant, wanted plaintiff cut off. Id. "
403,10, The brother was also a defendant charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine base.
403,11, See Plaintiff's Opposition Brief at 12. 
404,12," Even if I were to admit French's testimony, it does not satisfy the separate and apart standard. All French could testify to is 
the fact that secret meetings occurred. This merely demonstrates the fallibility of the intermediate standard because every price-
fixing conspiracy will have similar secret meetings. Furthermore, plaintiffs will not find comfort in the record of the companion case, Supermarket of Marlinton v. Meadow Gold, et 
al., 874 F. Supp. 721. As discussed in the opinion in that case, the non-French testimony is similarly insufficient to satisfy the 
separate and apart standard. See Supermarket of Marlinton v. Meadow Gold, et al., 874 F. Supp. 721 (W.D. Va. 1994). "
407,1," DRS was involved in the course of events underlying this action. However, because plaintiff DIJ is successor in interest to 
DRS' catheter business, and for purposes of clarity, we shall refer to DRS and DIJ collectively as ""plaintiff."" Defendants have at 
no time opposed such reference."
407,2," Although we need not here consider our diversity jurisdiction, for future purposes we note that plaintiff is organized under the 
laws of Delaware and maintains its principal place of business in Connecticut; that defendant Critikon is a New Jersey 
corporation with its principal place of business in Florida; and that defendant Johnson & Johnson, is a New Jersey corporation 
which maintains its principal place of business in New Jersey. "
408,3," These facts are wholly consistent with facts alleged by DIJ in its letter of March 11, 1994. DIJ submitted that letter in response 
to a request made by the court during argument. At that time counsel for DIJ asserted that its client had, by letter, informed 
Critikon that it intended to sell its technology elsewhere because of Critikon's delay in exercising its contractual rights. Thereafter 
we observed that the amended complaint made no such specific allegations. Accordingly, we gave counsel one week's leave to 
propose an amendment including such allegations, keeping in mind the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11. DIJ's proposed amendment (submitted annexed to the March 11 letter), however, made no specific allegations at all; it included 
the following two paragraphs:"
408,79," b. By communications and conduct, DIJ notified Critikon that it would demonstrate its invention to other parties prior to 
completion of Design Review II."
408,79," c. The parties, by communications and/or by conduct, modified their agreement such that in 1988, Critikon made an offer 
to DIJ for rights to the DIJ split needle IV Catheter inventions. For purposes of deciding this motion we thus disregard the additional facts alleged by counsel at argument, and rely solely upon 
the allegations of the amended complaint."
408,4," Critikon claims that during discovery it realized that DIJ should have been listed as co-inventor of two of the patented products 
and therefore moved to correct the patents. It also claims it has given DIJ an irrevocable royalty-free license to use the patents. "
409,5," We note that the complaint states that in order for DIJ's catheter to have been accepted by U.S. medical practitioners such 
practitioners would have had to convert from their customary use of the over-the-needle variety to the split needle. Amend. 
Comp. at P 164. However, the it suggests, because as of 1988 no effective stickless catheter was on the market, the medical 
community would have been willing to make such a shift. See id. at P 165."
409,6," It is undisputed that HN2[
] to state a claim under C.G.S.A. § 35-27, DIJ must plead the same elements which it must under § 2 of the Sherman Act, and that in adjudicating claims under § 35-27, Connecticut courts routinely apply case law pertaining to 
the Sherman Act. DIJ has cited one Second Circuit case observing that the Connecticut Antitrust Act ""will not necessarily be 
interpreted identically to federal provisions."" Conn. v. Levi Strauss & Co. (D. Conn. 1979) 471 F. Supp. 363, 368. However, DIJ 
has not cited any Connecticut authority which might persuade us that that state's law regarding antitrust standing differs at all 
with federal law. Thus our determination here reaches DIJ's Connecticut, as well as federal, antitrust claims. "
416,1," Nichols alleges that Tucker/Rocky and Parts Unlimited tortiously interfered with Nichols' contract with Dunlop (Count XVI) and 
tortiously interfered with Nichols' prospective economic advantage (Count XVII), with the two Counts each adding that 
Tucker/Rocky and Parts Unlimited ""conspired to"" interfere. "
424,1," According to the written offer of employment, the plaintiff would be paid an hourly salary as a consultant for the first three 
months of service as director of public relations. Offer at 1. Following that time the plaintiff would be appointed vice president of 
public relations upon mutual agreement of terms. Id. "
426,2," Because the Sherman Act does not provide a private right of action, the court treats the plaintiff's Sherman Act claim as a claim 
under the Clayton Act. Section 4 provides in relevant part: Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue 
therefor . . . and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable 
attorney's fee."
426,15, U.S.C.A § 15(a). 
428,3," The plaintiff attempts to re-state his antitrust claim with specificity in his reply brief. He identifies the relevant market as the 
""marketing/communications area in Southern New Hampshire"" (Plaintiff's Memorandum at 1-2), and as the ""Southern New 
Hampshire marketing business"" (Id. at 33). The court cannot properly assess the antitrust claim with such a skeletal description 
of a market."
428,4," The court notes that Digital purports to have adopted the purchasing policy to maintain the integrity of its procurement process 
by preventing former employees from having an unfair advantage when competing for Digital contracts. To the extent the 
application of the policy serves its purpose, the defendant's conduct promotes competition and, thus, the plaintiff's claim is 
""inimical to the antitrust laws."" See Atlantic Richfield Co., 110 S. Ct. at 1889. "
429,5," The plaintiff alleges that he was injured by his inability to continue to work as a consultant for and eventually achieve an equity 
position with Windsor. This is an employment relationship for purposes of considering the directness of injury and causal 
connection factors. Thus, the apparent dispute over whether the plaintiff was technically an ""employee"" or ""consultant"" neither 
impedes the court's antitrust standing inquiry nor creates a genuine dispute of material fact that would defeat the motion for 
summary judgment."
429,6," In arriving at this conclusion the court does not determine whether, if true, Digital's use of the purchasing policy to benefit 
Quantic would constitute a violation of the antitrust laws. "
430,7," The state statute provides: I. Every contract, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of trade is unlawful. II. Every contract, combination, or conspiracy is unlawful which has the purpose or effect of: (a) Fixing, controlling or maintaining prices, rates, quotations or fees in any part of trade or commerce; or (b) Fixing, controlling, maintaining, limiting or discontinuing the production, manufacture, mining, sale or distribution of any 
commodity or service; or (c) Allocating or dividing customers or markets in any part of trade or commerce; or (d) Refusing to deal, or coercing, persuading or inducing any person to refuse to deal, with another person; or (e) Fixing or controlling the price quotation of any bid for a public or private contract, submitting sham or complementary 
bids, or controlling the submission of bids including refusals to bid. RSA § 356:2. "
431,8," At issue in this case is the very essence of the inherent and fundamental constitutional right of Francis Donovan to seek and 
pursue his livelihood without the oppressive interference of a corporate giant that did actually destroy his business. Plaintiff's Memorandum at 9."
431,9," The parties disagree on whether the retirement agreement incorporates by reference or supersedes the purchasing policy. The 
court need not resolve the question. Because the existence or non-existence of a given limitation on post-retirement employment "
432,," itself presents a dispute arising out of an employment relationship, an attempt to resolve the dispute is not cognizable as 
consumer protection claim."
432,10," According to the Restatement: One who intentionally and improperly interferes with the performance of a contract (except a contract to marry) between 
another and a third person by inducing or otherwise causing the third person not to perform the contract, is subject to 
liability to the other for the pecuniary loss resulting from the failure of the third person to perform the contract. Restatement (Second) of Torts § 766. "
433,11," In support of its motion, the defendant asserts that the plaintiff cannot prevail on this element of the tort claim because, as a 
matter of law, Digital has not ""improperly"" interfered with a third party relationship. Defendant's Memorandum at 11 (citing 
Emery, 701 F.2d at 989). Rather than address the question of whether the defendant acted improperly here, the court follows the 
approach of the court of appeals in Emery and will address the defendant's argument in the context of the § 773 affirmative 
defense. See 701 F.2d at 988-89. "
444,1," By amendment dated as of April 1, 1993, Malhotra's affiliate World Phone, Inc. became a party to the Agreement. (Second 
Amendment to Cooperative Marketing Agreement, Art. 1.) IAN amended its complaint after the production to it by AT&T of the Agreement. IAN has not sought leave to amend again in 
response to the present motion."
444,2," Paragraph 7.1 of the Agreement provides that ""during the Term of this Agreement, AT&T agrees not to enter into a cooperative 
marketing arrangement such as this Agreement for any countries to which this Agreement applies, covering in-bound 
international sent-paid calling to ""POTS"" telephone numbers for U.S.-based recorded voice information services."" Pursuant to 
the amendment dated as of April 1, 1993, the term of the Agreement was extended ""to include an additional period from July 8, 
1993 until December 31, 1994 (the 'Extension Term')."" (Art. 2.A.) ""During the Extension Term, the provisions of Article 7 of the . . 
. Agreement (which concern exclusivity) shall no longer apply to any country."" (Id. Art. 4.A.) ""'POTS' is an acronym signifying 'plain old telephone service' (as distinguished from, for example, 800-number or 900-number 
service)."" (Def. Mem. at 6 n.5.) ""A 'sent-paid' call is one billed to the telephone number from which it is placed. A 'sent-paid' call 
initiated in a foreign country is thus billed to the caller's telephone number by the foreign telephone company responsible for 
service to that number."" (Id. at 5 n.4 (citations omitted))."
444,3," In a letter to Malhotra dated May 13, 1992, AT&T refers to an authorization to Malhotra ""to initiate Audiotext service throughout 
the world."" It is not clear, however, that this statement is intended to refer to more than the approximately 120 countries to which 
the Agreement was extended. The question is not relevant to the decision of the present motion. "
446,4," In Berkey, the court had said that ""it is improper, in the absence of a valid business policy, for a firm with monopoly power in 
one market to gain a competitive advantage in another by refusing to sell a rival the monopolized goods or services he needs to 
compete effectively in the second market."" 603 F.2d at 284. It has been suggested, however, in the wake of Eastman Kodak Co. 
v. Image Technical Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265, 112 S. Ct. 2072 (1992), and Spectrum Sports, that, to sustain 
a monopoly leveraging claim, more must be shown than that the monopolist sought to obtain ""a competitive advantage"" in the 
second market, and that, rather, monopolization or at least a dangerous threat of monopolization, of the second market must be 
made to appear. See Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, P 626.1 (Supp. 1993). In Twin Labs., the Second 
Circuit characterized the passage quoted from Berkey, 603 F.2d at 284, as requiring ""tangible harm to competition"" in the 
second market. 900 F.2d at 571. The District Courts in the Second Circuit have adhered to Berkey, with the Twin Labs. gloss.

Ortho Diagnostic, 822 F. Supp. at 155. "
448,5," It is not clear what IAN means by ""technical considerations described above."" (Id.) The Court must assume that the reference 
is to the AT&T ""network"" discussed above through which ""all calls coming from abroad must go."" (Id. P 24.)"
448,6," ""Foreign PTTs"" are ""correspondent post, telephone and telegraph companies…in other countries."" (Id. at 3.) "
449,7," AT&T represented at oral argument that, at the present time, it does not offer 900-service arrangements in connection with 
calls from foreign countries. (Transcript, Sept. 15, 1993, at 18.)"
449,8," ""Traffic stimulation services"" is AT&T's characterization of the services for which it pays Malhotra under the terms of the 
Agreement. AT&T has suggested that MCI is offering such an arrangement at least as to calls from some foreign countries. 
(Transcript, Sept. 15, 1993, at 19-20.)"
449,9," As, noted above, AT&T does not actually bill anyone on behalf of Malhotra, but Malhotra does receive an analogous benefit 
under the Agreement. The Court will refer to this benefit as ""billing services,"" retaining the quotation marks. "
450,10," IAN distinguishes between its ""actual"" monopolization and monopoly leveraging claims in its Letter Brief of September 23, 
1993. See id. at 1-2 & 4 n.6."
450,11," New York law similarly requires that in an agreement constituting a joint venture, ""there must be a provision for the sharing of 
both profits and losses."" Itel Containers Int'l Corp. v. Atlanttrafik Express Serv. Ltd., 909 F.2d 698, 701 (2d Cir. 1990). "
451,12," A greater than 70% share, of course, does not establish, irrespective of any other consideration, monopoly power. Rather, ""a 
share above 70% is usually strong evidence of monopoly power."" Broadway Delivery,  651 F.2d at 129."
451,13," The question of ""proportionate return"" was injected into the case when AT&T, prefacing its statement, quoted above, that ""as 
of 1991 [it] received only 70.8 percent of telephone traffic originating in the United States,"" stated that the FCC ""requires foreign 
correspondents to allocate in-bound traffic to U.S. carriers in proportion to the amount of out-bound traffic that each carrier sends 
to the foreign correspondent. This requirement is referred to as 'proportionate return.'"" (Def. Mem. at 21 (citing In re Regulation 
of Int'l Accounting Rates, 7 FCC Rcd No. 25, 8040-41, 8045-46).) See generally, Michael J. Kellogg, John Thorne, Peter W. 
Huber, Federal Telecommunications Law, § 15.5.2 (1992), for the context and purpose of the ""proportionate return"" policy. By 
Memorandum and Order dated June 9, 1994, the Court requested the parties to brief the significance of the ""proportionate 
return"" policy to the present motion. AT&T argues that it is irrelevant; IAN that it supports its Section 2 claims. It appears from the 
parties' supplemental briefing that it is not the case under the ""proportionate return"" policy, as the Court had thought it might be, 
that ""if [AT&T] has a 70.8% market share (overall) of out-bound traffic to foreign countries, it must have a 70.8% share of in-
bound traffic from foreign countries, and also a 70.8% share of in-bound traffic to Malhotra, with other U.S. Carriers receiving the 
balance."" (Mem. & Order, June 9, 1994 at 2.) (See Def. Supp. Mem. at 7-9.) On the other hand, there is nothing in the parties' 
supplemental briefing to show that AT&T's share of in-bound traffic to Malhotra (or of all overseas calls to United States based 
IPs, to the extent that there is such traffic to anyone other than Malhotra) is not of a magnitude sufficient to satisfy any numerical 
test applicable at the pleading stage. "
452,14," See n.10, supra."
452,15," Aspen does not discuss the ""essential facility"" doctrine as such, but is nevertheless pertinent. ""Although the Court did not rest 
on the essential facility doctrine utilized by the Tenth Circuit [in Aspen], its decision may very well influence the disposition of 
subsequent denials of an alleged essential facility."" Phillip A. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, P 736.1f (Supp. 
1993) (footnote omitted)."

455,18, IAN does not claim that AT&T's entry into the Agreement amounted to a per se violation.

cannot do both. 47 U.S.C. § 207."
456,20," As noted in Section 4, supra, of this Memorandum and Order, there is no basis for an inference that AT&T has not 
transported, or will not transport, calls to IAN's telephone numbers. "
471,1," Compare The Green Book 1991-92, The Official Directory of the City of New York 89, with The 1993-94 Green Book, the

473,3," Plaintiffs have raised no objection based on the minor differences in the identity of the parties or on the fact that the individual 
defendants in Hirschfeld I were sued only in their official capacities, whereas the individual defendants here are sued in both 
their official and individual capacities. Plaintiffs' tactical judgment is understandable in view of the fact that they seek the benefit 
of collateral estoppel against all of the defendants in this action. (Cpt PP 53-57) Moreover, it appears that the City of New York 
and the four new members of the Board, insofar as they are sued in their official capacities, are in privity with the Hirschfeld I 
defendants and thus are entitled to take advantage of the prior judgment. See e.g., Conner v. Reinhard, 847 F.2d 384, 394 (7th 
Cir.) cert. denied, 488 U.S. 856, 102 L. Ed. 2d 118, 109 S. Ct. 147 (1988). Further, we would be inclined to hold, on the facts of this case, that the individual defendants who were parties to Hirschfeld I are 
entitled to assert, in their individual capacities, the Hirschfeld I judgment defensively against plaintiffs. While a party who litigates 
in one capacity ordinarily is not affected by the judgment in subsequent litigation in which the party litigates in another capacity 
(see, e.g., Restatement (Second) Judgments § 36 (1982)), that principle has no proper application here. Its rationale is that a 
party who occupies both individual and representative capacities may have conflicting interests with respect to the conduct of 
litigation. Restatement (Second) Judgments § 36, comment a. In consequence, principles of former adjudication ought not 
aggravate the problem by effectively compelling one sued or who sues, for example, in a representative capacity to consider 
also his or her personal interests. But these considerations are absent here. Mr. Hirschfeld labored under no conflicting interests 
in Hirschfeld I, so there is no legitimate reason for his having failed to assert against the members of the Board of Elections all 
claims that he had against them with respect to his effort to gain a place on the ballot. The only objection to application of claim 
preclusion therefore would be an absence of mutuality borne of the possibility that the Hirschfeld I judgment might not bind the 
defendants in their individual capacities. E.g., Roy v. City of Augusta, Maine, 712 F.2d 1517, 1521-22 (1st Cir. 1983). But 
adherence to the rule of mutuality in these circumstances would be questionable. See, e.g., Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. 
University of Illinois Foundation, 402 U.S. 313, 28 L. Ed. 2d 788, 91 S. Ct. 1434 (1971)."

477,2," Although at one time Buckhead America Corporation was a defendant to the action brought by Savannah Soaps, and Days 
Inns of America, Inc. was not a party to that action, Buckhead has since been dropped and Days Inns added by court order. 
Thus, the defendants in the Valley and Savannah cases are now identical."

477,4," Guest did not file a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) but instead filed a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings 
and an answer. In both its motion and answer Guest asserted the defense of failure to state a claim, a defense virtually identical 
to that raised in the two motions to dismiss, and all parties have dealt with it accordingly. This order shall constitute the court's 
ruling on Guest's defense of failure to state a claim to the same extent as the motions to dismiss."

477,6, Similar allegations appear in Savannah's pleadings. 
478,7," More specifically, the language of the proposed amended complaint provides that: in the event that any franchisees failed to utilize the HFS logo, which HFS now permits only Marietta and Guest Supply to

479,9," Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act function as the private enforcement provisions for claims brought under federal antitrust 
law. Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, 479 U.S. 104, 109, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427, 107 S. Ct. 484 (1986). Section 4 of the Clayton Act 
provides for money damages, while Section 16 affords injunctive relief. Although antitrust standing is required to state a claim 
under all provisions of federal antitrust law, ""the source of the antitrust injury requirement"" lies in Section 4 of the Clayton Act. 
Id. Therefore, for purposes of this motion to dismiss, the court will focus on an analysis of that section. However, the court's 
findings with respect to antitrust standing apply to all provisions of federal antitrust law raised in conjunction with the matter 
before the court. "
482,10," For purposes of clarity, plaintiffs' Count 5 Lanham Act claim is also dismissed because that claim is contingent on the success 
of the Sherman and Clayton Act federal antitrust claims. Because the federal antitrust claims fail for lack of antitrust injury, the 
Lanham Act claim must also be dismissed."
482,11," Ga. Const. Art. III, § 6, P 5 (1983) provides: "
483,," The General Assembly shall not have the power to authorize any contract or agreement which may have the effect of or 
which is intended to have the effect of defeating or lessening competition, or encouraging a monopoly, which are hereby 
declared to be unlawful and void. Id."
483,12," Ga. Code Ann. § 13-8-2(a)(2) (Michie 1990) states in relevant part: (a) A contract which is against the policy of the law cannot be enforced. Contracts deemed contrary to public policy include 
but are not limited to: . . . (2) Contracts in general restraint of trade . . . . Id. "
487,1," Scott does cite to Antil v. Southwest Envelope Co., 601 S.W.2d 47 (Tex. Civ. App.--Beaumont 1979, no writ) for the 
proposition that ""once the court announces its decision on the motion for summary judgment, however, the plaintiff cannot take a 
non-suit."" This sentence does not appear in the Antil opinion, nor does the Antil opinion address this question. "

500,3," See NBA I, 754 F. Supp. at 1339-42."
500,4," Testimony at trial elicited numerous examples of actions by individual teams that were opposed by and ran counter to the best 
interests of the NBA or other teams. For example, the Portland Trailblazers signed a contract with Chris Dudley that the league 
office opposed, and the Clippers moved from San Diego to Los Angeles to compete directly with the Los Angeles Lakers who 
had earlier moved from Minnesota. Tr. 5985 (Colangelo), 7023-25 (Fisher). "
501,5," The Board of Governors of the NBA is comprised of one representative entitled to one vote from each of the 27 or more 
member clubs. SF P 48. The teams have also entered into agreements on game rules, as well as collective bargaining 
arrangements with players, the college draft, group insurance, and the licensing of certain products and national television 
contracts. SF P 52."
501,6," Testimony at trial revealed that 12 of the present 27 NBA teams have played professional basketball separate from the NBA at 
some point. Four of those teams competed directly against NBA teams as members of the ABA, including the New Jersey Nets 
who compete today with the New York Knicks within the NBA much as they did between leagues when the Nets were part of the 
ABA. Tr. 3747-52 (Stern)."

(1982)."
502,11," As noted in NBA I, the money earned and distributed by the NBA represents only 15-20% of the gross revenues of the more 
successful teams. In contrast, approximately 70% of the total revenues of teams in the National Football League are derived 
from the league and shared equally. Moreover, Paul Tagliabue, the Commissioner of the NFL, estimated that only 5-10% of a 
team's revenues ""is not shared in any way."" NBA I, 754 F. Supp. at 1341, citing Tagliabue Dep. at 69-71. "
507,12," This type of agreement is not covered by HN12[
] the Sports Broadcasting Act because the SBA only applies to agreements 
regarding ""sponsored telecasting."" While telecasting on TNT may be considered sponsored telecasting because TNT does 
receive some revenues from advertising in addition to subscription fees, see Chicago Pro. Sports Ltd. Partnership v. National 
Basketball Ass'n, 808 F. Supp. 646, 649-51 (N.D. Ill. 1992), pure subscription or pay-per-view telecasts clearly are not 
considered sponsored telecasting. "
509,13," At present, WGN in Chicago, WTBS in Atlanta, and WWOR and WPIX in New York, are the only local broadcast stations that 
are capable of reaching more than 5 million subscribers outside of any teams' designated market. SF P 18. WPIX does not 
telecast any NBA games, WWOR is no longer broadcasting Nets games, and, under the new Turner contract, WTBS has 
stopped carrying only Hawks games. In effect, therefore, WGN and the Bulls are the only parties whose desire to telecast games 
will be frustrated by the new limitations. Tr. 3811-19, 3919-20."
509,14," With the addition of the two new scheduled franchises, Toronto and Vancouver, the number of NBA regular season match 
ups will grow, likely adding 82 new games for a total of 1,189."
509,15," We note that the NBA has only contracted to telecast 70 of the 85 games allowed under the NBC contract to be shown on 
cable and or superstations (45 on TNT and 25 on WTBS). Nationally this represents a 15 game reduction below the 111 game 
maximum. Note also, however, that as long as this court's injunction remains unmodified, the Bulls, against the wishes of the 
NBA, may telecast an additional 25 games nationally over WGN. "
510,16," We note also that during the 1991-92 season 50 regular season Bulls games were telecast nationally over various outlets. 
This number was 43 for the 1990-91 season and 40 for the 1989-90 season. SF P 372. "
511,17," From 1986 to 1989 no NBA games were telecast on superstations. Beginning with the 1989-90 season, however, 
superstation coverage increased, with 56 games shown between WGN (25), WTBS (25) and WWOR (6). During the 1990-91 
season 51 games were carried -- WGN (25), WTBS (21) and WWOR (6). During the 1991-92 season 66 games were telecast -- 
WGN (30), WTBS (30) and WWOR (6). During the 1992-93 season, 70 games were shown -- WTBS (30), WTBS (30) and 
WWOR (10)."
511,18, The numbers of seasonal telecasts discussed below are for regular season games and include the all-star game. 
518,19," A premise which the evidence indicates may be just the opposite -- testimony at trial indicated that the additional games on 
superstations have increased the league's exposure to the public overall, and weaker teams have actually increased their 
marketing efforts in an effort to reach viewers. "
528,1," The System is also known by its Du Pont trade name, Silverlith (""Silverlith""), and its Eskofot trade name, Proff Print High 
Speed (""Proff Print"")."
528,2," Plaintiff classifies as ""consumables"" three components of the direct-to-plate silver halide metal platemaking system: the plate 
processor, the plate, and the processing chemicals. "
529,3," The complaint defines the System as consisting of four components: cameras or other hardware, plate processors, plates, and 
processing chemicals. Defendant Mem. at 10."
529,4, The parties do not dispute that both Eskofot and Du Pont U.K. are foreign corporations. 
530,5," The Court notes that even if the FTAIA standard were the appropriate one, plaintiff has alleged facts from which a reasonable 
trier of fact could conclude that defendants' conduct had a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect in the United 
States. "
531,6," It is only after plaintiff indicates the effective date of Rule 4(k)(2) in its own papers and establishes that defendants failed to 
dispute the applicability of Rule 4(k)(2), Plaintiff Mem. at 38 n. 19, that defendants first contend that the Rule should not be 
applied retroactively."
531,7," Defendants merely assert that the instant case was filed after the effective date of Rule 4(k)(2) and that the rule should not be 
given retroactive effect. They offer no argument in favor of such a finding, nor do they even attempt to demonstrate why it would 
not be just and practicable to apply the rule to the instant action. Cf. Arango-Aradondo v. I.N.S., 13 F.3d 610, 612 (2d Cir. 1994) "
532,," (""we see no reason why it is not 'just and practicable' to apply the amended Rule to the facts of this case, and the Government 
has proffered no argument as to why we should rule differently."")"
532,8," HN10[
] In an international context in particular, the third test must, however, be applied with caution. The person sought to 
be charged must know, or have good reason to know, that his conduct will have effects in the state seeking to assert jurisdiction 
over him. It is not enough that causing an injury within the forum may be foreseeable, within the meaning od proximate causation 
and tort liability; rather, the foreseeability that is critical to due process analysis is that the defendant's conduct and connection 
with the forum state are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there. Herbstein v. Bruetman, 768 F. Supp. 79, 81-82 (S.D.N.Y. 1991) (citations, quotations and ellipses omitted). "
533,9," This Court is not convinced by defendants' efforts to limit plaintiff's action to one for breach of contract. The complaint asserts 
antitrust causes of action, and the facts alleged in support of the antitrust claims are not limited to simple breach of contract 
allegations. Therefore, defendants' arguments that: (1) the only act relevant to personal jurisdiction alleged by plaintiff is the 
termination of the consumables agreement, Defendant Mem. at 28; (2) Du Pont U.K. is not aware of any plan on the part of 
Eskofot to sell direct-to-plate silver halide systems in the United States, id.; and (3) the gravamen of plaintiff's cause of action is 
not the exhibition of products at trade shows in the United States but the cancellation of its agreements with Du Pont U.K., id. at 
32; are unavailing. Such statements are ineffective to limit plaintiff's action, and to the extent that they have force, they serve 
only to put material facts in dispute."
533,10," Defendants challenge many of plaintiff's factual allegations. For example, defendants contest Eskofot's assertions that it 
intended to market Proff Print in the United States, that Du Pont U.K. planned to market Silverlith in the United States, that 
defendants deliberately terminated their contracts with Eskofot to obtain monopoly power, that defendants terminated the 
agreements with the knowledge that it would have an effect on United States commerce, that such an effect was intentional, that 
Du Pont U.K. currently markets and sells Silverlith in the United States, and that Du Pont U.K. is selling millions of dollars worth 
of products, unrelated to Silverlith, in the United States. Defendants succeed in placing these factual allegations in dispute, but 
not in demonstrating that they are no more than argumentative inferences. Consequently, as alleged facts, they must be viewed 
as true, and are therefore sufficient to defeat defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. "
535,11, Plaintiff asserts that it is likely that the English action will not go to trial until late 1995 or early 1996. Plaintiff Mem. at 71. 
536,12," ""Unlike the proof required to establish a conspiracy to monopolize under section 2, a specific intent to create a monopoly is 
not required under section 1. At a minimum, however, the circumstances must be such as to warrant a jury in finding that the 
conspirators had a unity or purpose or a common design and understanding, or a meeting of minds in an unlawful arrangement."" 
Walsh at 793 (citations and quotations omitted) (emphasis added). Clearly, Walsh stands for the proposition that unity of 
purpose is required when conspiracy is alleged under section one, but it nowhere requires the same common understanding 
when contract or combination is alleged. Defendants cite Caremark Homecare, Inc. v. New England Critical Care, Inc., 700 F. Supp. 1033, 1035 (D. Minn 1988) and 
Domed Stadium Hotel, Inc. v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 732 F.2d 480, 486 (5th Cir. 1984) for the proposition that ""courts have 
consistently held that an acquisition will not give rise to a Section One claim unless the companies involved combined to restrain 
trade prior to the acquisition."" Reply Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Complaint 
(""Defendant Reply"") at 44 (emphasis in original). Caremark, however, deals with a conspiracy claim and specifically holds ""thus 
the element of a conspiracy has not been properly pleaded."" Caremark at 1035 (emphasis added). Similarly, in Domed Stadium, the court specifically found that no combination occurred in violation of section one of the Sherman 
Act based on the fact that it had already determined that the combination, in that case, did not violate section seven of the 
Clayton Act. The court, in that case, also found that there was no conspiracy in violation of section one of the Sherman Act 
because the defendants did not conspire before their merger, and after their merger, as one entity, they could not conspire. That 
court did not find, however, that no combination in violation of section one occurred because the defendants did not conspire 
prior to combining. "
537,13," Defendants attempt to collapse the independent bases that combination and contract provide for the existence of a section 
one violation. If plaintiff always needed to demonstrate that there existed a unity of purpose between defendants and others, 
then all combination and contract claims would necessarily encompass a conspiracy claim."
537,14," Specifically, Rule 408 provides: HN21[
] Evidence of (1) furnishing or offering or promising to furnish or (2) accepting or offering or promising to accept, a 
valuable consideration or attempting to compromise a claim which was disputed as to either liability or amount, is not 
admissible to prove liability for or invalidity of the claim or its amount. Evidence of conduct or statements made in 
compromise negotiations is likewise not admissible. Fed. R. Evid. 408. "
538,15," HN24[
] Evidentiary questions, such as the one present in this case, should especially be avoided at such a preliminary 
stage of the proceedings. Usually the questions of relevancy and admissibility in general require the context of an ongoing and 
unfolding trial in which to be properly decided. And ordinarily neither a district court nor an appellate court should decide to strike 
a portion of the complaint - on the grounds that the material could not possibly be relevant - on the sterile field of the pleadings 
alone. Lipsky, 551 F.2d at 893. "
549,1," ""Potash,"" a mineral typically mined from land deposits, is widely used in the United States, primarily for agricultural purposes. It 
is one of the three basic raw materials (along with phosphorous and nitrogen) used for fertilizer production. The predominant 
form of potash is ""muriate of potash,"" also known as ""potassium chloride."" Muriate of potash is available in three different particle 
sizes -- standard, coarse, and granular. Additional forms of potash include sulfate of potash, manure salts, soluble and chemical "
550,," grades of muriate of potash, and sulfate of potash-magnesium. Muriate of potash constitutes nearly all of the potash consumed 
in the United States."
550,2," That Memorandum Opinion and Order related to Defendants' Joint Motion to Disqualify Plaintiffs' Counsel and Dismiss Their 
Complaints. The Court granted that Motion. The Plaintiffs subsequently filed another Complaint (Plaintiffs' Third Amended and 
Consolidated Class Action Complaint, (hereinafter ""TAC""), Doc. No. 249) on July 8, 1994. Defendants moved to dismiss 
Plaintiffs' TAC October 24, 1994. The Court denied that Motion. (See Order dated November 7, 1994, Doc. No. 342.) The 
Plaintiffs' TAC is the basis of the present action."
550,3," For the purposes of the present Motion, the Court will presume that Plaintiffs' allegations relating to the named Defendants' 
corporate organizations are accurate. (See TAC PP 9-30.)"
550,4," In November 1989, it acquired all the assets and liabilities of Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan (""Crown PCS""). At all 
relevant times, PCS, Inc. and Crown PCS were engaged in the business of producing and selling potash. (TAC P 9.)"
550,5," PCS Sales is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PCS, Inc.; at all material times, it has engaged in the business of selling potash. 
(TAC P 10.)"
550,6," Central Potash was incorporated under the laws of Ontario. Pursuant to the terms of an amalgamation agreement dated 
January 31, 1979, and by articles of amalgamation effective February 1, 1979, Central Potash and Noranda amalgamated and "
551,," continued as one entity under the name ""Noranda Metals Industries Limited."" On or about December 30, 1978, Noranda Metals 
Industries Limited changed its name to ""407538 Ontario Limited."" (TAC P 20.)"
551,7," The TAC was filed on July, 8, 1994. "
553,8," Defendants combine their Rule 23(a)(3) and Rule 23(a)(4) analyses. Defendants correctly point out that these Rules essentially 
have the same purpose of ensuring that the interests and goals of the named representatives are sufficiently aligned with those 
of the putative class. As many courts have recognized, the typicality and adequacy requirements of Rule 23(a) significantly 
overlap. See General Telephone Co. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 n.13, 102 S. Ct. 2364, 2370 n.13, 72 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1982); 3B 
Moore's Federal Practice P 23.06-2 at 23-169 (2d ed. 1993 & Supp. 1994) (noting that ""the [Rule] (a)(3) requirement that claims 
or defenses be 'typical' has been equated with the requirement that the representative party must adequately represent the 
class, or with one of the elements usually considered as part of this adequacy requirement"") (citing cases). The Court will, 
however, engage in the analytical schema established by the Rules."
553,9," Defendants allege there are only 25-30 purchasers who fit in this category. (See Defs.' Mem. in Opp. to Class Cert. at 12 & 12 
n.6.) "
554,10," Specifically, Defendants claim that these large-volume purchasers are able to use their superior bargaining positions to obtain 
volume discounts, off-season price discounts, and special inventory fill promotional discounts; they are able to obtain more 
favorable pricing through long-term contracts and/or special bid quotes; and are able to utilize warehousing arrangements and 
other storage, distribution, inventory, transportation or handling arrangements to further reduce price. (Defs.' Mot. in Opp. to 
Class Cert. at 13.)"
554,11," There is a wealth of authority supporting this position. See In re Brand Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litig., MDL No. 997, 
1994 WL 663590 (N.D. Ill. 1994); In re Catfish Antitrust Litig., 826 F. Supp. 1019 (N.D. Miss. 1993) (holding that class of catfish 
purchasers satisfied typicality requirement despite purchasers' varying sizes, geographical locations, and buying methods 
because the substance of antitrust price-fixing claim was the same for all class members); In re Domestic Air Transp. 
Antitrust Litig., 137 F.R.D. 677, 699 (N.D. Ga. 1991) (holding typicality requirement satisfied because named plaintiffs' claims 
stemmed from same legal theory as class claims notwithstanding fact that class purchased tickets at different prices according 
to different terms); In re Wirebound Boxes Antitrust Litig., 128 F.R.D. at 270, 272 (finding typicality requirement satisfied when 
the scope, impact and existence of alleged conspiracy was the same for all class members notwithstanding defendants' claims 
of disparity in pricing procedures, individualized markets and individually negotiated prices); In re South Central States Bakery 
Prod. Antitrust Litig., 86 F.R.D. 407, 415 (M.D. La. 1980) (factual variations do not destroy typicality where all purported class 
members must establish same elements of price-fixing claim); Minnesota v. United States Steel Corp., 44 F.R.D. 559, 566 (D. 
Minn. 1968) (claims of representative parties satisfied typicality requirement because proof of conspiracy and price fixing were 
common to all notwithstanding defendants' argument that claims were atypical because of diverse methods of procuring and 
producing fabricated steel); see also 1 Herbert B. Newberg & Alba Conte, Newberg on Class Actions, § 3.13 at 3-79 & n.208 
(3d. ed. 1992) (explaining that ""differences in the methods of purchase or kinds of products purchased among class members 
have been held not to bar a finding of typical claims"" in price-fixing actions, and that ""in class actions charging defendants with a 
conspiracy to fix prices, the claims of the named plaintiffs were held typical of the claims of the class members despite variations 
in the manner in which members of the class purchased from the defendants, variations in the kind of products purchased, 
differences in price, and other factors"") (citing cases)."
554,12," In rejecting a claim that the named plaintiffs must have a large financial interest in the litigation, one court explained that: To assert that the minute interest of the parties before the court is a factor which militates against allowing a class action is 
to ignore the spirit of Rule 23. Since, as we have seen, if the plaintiffs' claim is very large, the class action is rendered 
unnecessary, the main purpose of the class action is to provide a means of vindicating small claims. It would be anomalous 
to hold that only major financial interests can make use of it. Dolgow v. Anderson, 43 F.R.D. 472, 495 (E.D.N.Y. 1968). "
555,13," See Addis Aff. P 21 (""I do not believe that the litigation is in the long-term interest of The Andersons or other major potash 
purchasers who rely on consistent and reliable distribution relationships with their suppliers""); Gauss Aff. P 25 (""I do not believe 
that the litigation is in the long-term interest of Northern Star or other major potash purchasers who rely on consistent and 
reliable distribution relationships with their suppliers""). "
556,14," If, as Defendants allege, 95% of the potash sold in the United States is bought by large-volume purchasers, (Defs.' Mem. in 
Opp. to Class Cert. at 1), then these purchasers could presumably protect any alleged interest in a ""stable market"" by opting out 
of the class. The remaining 5% hardly suffices to warrant Defendants' apocryphal ""parade of horribles"" relating to market 
instability. If the large-volume purchasers chose not to opt out, their interests will presumably not be maligned with Plaintiffs'. "
557,15," Specifically, Defendants contend that transaction prices during the relevant time period were affected by a United States 
Antidumping investigation and by Saskatchewan prorationing legislation. (Defs.' Mem. in Opp. to Class Cert. at 22.) Plaintiffs 
claim, however, that Defendant potash producers filed a petition with the United States International Trade Commission alleging 
Canadian potash was being ""dumped"" into the United States in furtherance of their conspiracy to fix potash prices. (TAC PP 48-
49.) "
558,16," This is an element essential to an antitrust price-fixing claim and one common to the class. The fact that some Plaintiffs may 
have paid more or less than others, although relevant in assessing damages, does not affect whether the conspiracy, if proven, 
would have had an impact common to the class. See In re Workers' Compensation, 130 F.R.D. at 110 (in considering whether 
insurers conspired to fix insurance rates, the Court explained that ""the multiple factors which affect rates"" relates to damages, 
not whether there was common proof of impact); In re Wirebound Boxes Antitrust Litig., 128 F.R.D. at 271-272 (explaining that 
""common proof of impact is possible even though prices"" are ""individually negotiated,"" and that defendants' reliance on 
""localized and unique"" markets and pricing procedures related to damages, not common fact of injury); In re Domestic Air 
Transp., 137 F.R.D. 677, 689 (N.D. Ga. 1991) (holding common impact satisfied because alleged price-fixing resulted in an 
""artificial"" base price, even though actual fares were discounted or negotiated); In re Screws Antitrust Litig., 91 F.R.D. 52, 56 (D. 
Mass. 1981) (holding that because fact of injury was a ""distinct question"" from quantum of injury, common proof could establish 
class-wide injury even though amount of damage to each plaintiff was uncertain); Hedges Enterprises, Inc. v. Continental Group, 
Inc., 81 F.R.D. 461, 475 (E.D. Pa. 1979) (finding common impact despite negotiated or discounted prices when plaintiffs alleged 
artificial minimum became ""base"" price); see also In re Brand Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litig., MDL No. 997, 1994 WL 
663590 at * 5 (N.D. Ill. 1994) (""proof of the merits of the plaintiffs' claim will not be contingent upon an individualized analysis of 
each and every transaction between each plaintiff and each defendant. Rather a liability determination will . . . hinge upon a 
showing of industry-wide practices, meetings, policies and agreements. Accordingly, despite the heterogenous nature of 'brand 
name prescription drugs' the fact of antitrust injury is a common, predominate question susceptible to common class-wide 
proof."")"
558,17," For example, Defendants cite Windham v. American Brands, Inc., 565 F.2d 59 (4th Cir. 1977), as authority for the proposition 
that the alleged diversity in the potash market precludes a common impact finding in this case. Defendants rely upon Windham 
for more than it represents. In Windham, the Fourth Circuit reviewed a district court's refusal to certify a class of flue-cured 
tobacco growers. The Windham court did not rely merely upon the size of the purchasers, the fact that prices were individually 
negotiated, or the fact that there were several grades of flue-cured tobacco. Instead, the Windham court, over a dissent, 
recognized that among other problems with the proposed certification, flue-cured tobacco was a non-standardized, non-fungible 
product; it had 161 different government grades; it was purchased by buyers using their own, internally different grading systems 
out of 36 different warehouses in 11 distinct geographical regions; and its price varied from day to day, government grade to 
government grade, market to market, and was improperly altered by auctioneers, not named as parties to the action, who 
occasionally manipulated auction results. Although potash is available in several grades, has several different applications, and "
559,," may be in the form of potassium chloride or potassium sulfate, the diversity in the potash market does not approach that of the 
flue-cured tobacco market discussed in Windham. Based upon the material presented, it appears that potash is a relatively 
homogenous product, and accordingly that the limited variations involved in this action are not so diverse as to create 
predominantly individual issues. In fact, Plaintiffs have provided evidence that only 2.2% of the transactions cited by Defendants 
involve potassium sulfate, and that potassium chloride, the vast majority of the potash at issue, is fungible and has officially been 
characterized by the International Trade Commission as ""one like product."" (See Rauser Suppl. Aff. PP 40-41.) Moreover, and 
not inconsequentially, the Windham court did not hold that the class proposed could not have been certified, it held that ""the 
denial of class certification was not an abuse of discretion on the part of the district court."" Windham, 565 F.2d at 62. The dissent 
found that failure to certify the class, at least with regard to the Sherman Act price-fixing allegation, was an abuse of discretion. 
Id. at 72 (Butzner, J., dissenting, incorporating opinion of Windham v. American Brands, Inc., reported at 539 F.2d 1016 (4th Cir. 
1976))."
559,18," Professor Rauser has submitted two affidavits alleging that a national price-fixing conspiracy in the potash market would have 
a common impact on potash purchasers. In his first Affidavit, Professor Rauser based his opinion on a variety of publicly 
available information relating to the potash industry, including industry summaries of monthly potash prices. (See Rauser Aff. P 
5.) In his Supplemental Affidavit, Professor Rauser also considered statistical information furnished to him by the Defendants 
relating to actual transaction prices and the Defendant producers' ""list"" prices. In his Supplemental Affidavit, Professor Rauser 
examined this new material and concluded that ""nothing has altered my earlier conclusion that the alleged price fixing conspiracy 
would have common impact on all members of the proposed class, or that a common formula exists with which to determine 
damages."" (Rauser Suppl. Aff. P 5.) Professor Rauser also stated, however, that the material supplied by the Defendants was 
incomplete and inconsistent. (Id. at P 5.)"
559,19," The alleged uniformity in price lists is particularly significant. In In re Domestic Air Transp., the court found the common impact 
element satisfied notwithstanding individual price negotiations because the alleged price fixing resulted in an ""artificial"" base 
price from which individual sale prices were negotiated. 137 F.R.D. 677, 689 (N.D. Ga. 1991). See also Hedges Enterprises, Inc. 
v. Continental Group, Inc., 81 F.R.D. 461, 475 (E.D. Pa. 1979) (finding common impact despite negotiated or discounted prices 
when plaintiffs' alleged artificial minimum became ""base"" price). "
561,20," The history of Rule 23(b)(3) also suggests that individual damage issues should not preclude class certification. In describing 
Rule 23(b)(3) the Rules Advisory Committee explained that ""[a] fraud perpetrated on numerous persons by the use of similar 
misrepresentations may be an appealing situation for a class action, and it may remain so despite the need, if liability is found, 
for separate determination of the damages suffered by individuals within the class."" Rules Advisory Comm. Notes to 1966 
Amendments to Rule 23, 39 F.R.D. 69, 103 (1966). This same rationale is manifestly applicable to damages caused by a 
national conspiracy."
561,21," Plaintiffs' damage claims are instituted under Section 4 of the Clayton Act, codified at 15 U.S.C.A. § 15 (1973 & Supp. 1994). 
Section 15b provides that ""any action to enforce any cause of action under sections 15 or 15a of this title shall be forever barred 
unless commenced within four years after the cause of action accrued."" Since the first complaint in this action was filed on April 
1, 1993, Defendants assert that claims arising before April, 1, 1989, should be barred. Plaintiffs' claim of fraudulent concealment, 
however, will toll the Clayton Act's statute of limitations. State of Texas v. Allan Constr. Co., 851 F.2d 1526, 1528-29 (5th Cir. 
1988). "
562,," On September 14, 1994, Defendants filed a Motion (Doc. No. 291) to strike the fraudulent concealment allegations from 
Plaintiffs' TAC. The Court denied that Motion on November 7, 1994. "
571,1," Health Choice, which operates a preferred provider organization (PPO), is a membership corporation, made up of physician 
members of Metrocare and Methodist Hospitals."
571,2," Metrocare negotiates with third-party payors of managed health care programs on behalf of its approximately 600 members, 
who are doctors with staff membership and clinical privileges at Methodist Hospitals."
571,3," Memphis Radiological is a physician-owned corporation which has an exclusive contract to perform diagnostic imaging 
services for in-patients of Methodist Hospitals."
571,4," The district court held plaintiffs failed to show the existence of a dispute in this regard, relying on the affidavit of Pamela 
Burford, Director of Staff Services for Methodist Hospitals. Burford asserted that the failure of a physician to abide by the inter-
referral system was not a ground for termination under the bylaws. Plaintiffs failed to submit affidavits of Metrocare doctors in 
support of their allegation, but requested further discovery to determine whether members could refer patients to plaintiffs 
without repercussion."
571,5," Plaintiffs assert that the relevant market is the market for out-patient diagnostic imaging services for Memphis area patients of 
the Metrocare Referring Physicians or, in the alternative, that the relevant market is the market for out-patient diagnostic imaging 
services for Memphis area out-patients. Because the record is undeveloped as to the availability of substitute services and the 
geographic area in which the parties compete, we express no opinion as to the proper definition of the relevant market. "
577,1, TUE is an electric utility which operates several lignite-fueled generating stations in Texas.
577,2," HL&P is an electric utility, and Northwestern is a mining company. "
580,3," Unlike the Defendant's ""obvious"" conclusory statements in Gossett, Plaintiff in this case makes conclusory statements that are 
far from obvious. Indeed, they go to the very heart of Plaintiff's burden of showing the relevant geographic market for its lignite. "
581,4," The latter statement depends on Francis' earlier comment concerning the internal study of NWR, which the Court has ruled to 
be inadmissible hearsay. Thus, no factual support is present for the conclusion asserted in Francis comment."
581,5," The Court notes that Plaintiff's Response later points to a report of one of Defendants' witnesses, which states that ""there are 
economic limits to how far [lignite] can be transported."" (Defendants' Exhibit L, at 13). However, Plaintiff can hardly use this as a 
basis for defining the geographic market (indeed, TCA does not use this statement in its formal argument for the relevant 
market) because it suffers from the same flaw as Epley's comment: it simply does not define what the economic limits for 
transportation are. Defendants' witness also states that ""the rail network in Texas provides easy rail access to many powerplant 
sites"" and that ""offsite lignite has been consumed by powerplants in Texas and Louisiana."" (Defendants' Exhibit L, at 14)."
581,6," In deciding this issue, the Court has assumed, without deciding, that the relevant product market is lignite. Defendants 
vigorously argue that this product market should be expanded to include alternative fuels such as gas and other forms of coal. 
Nevertheless, TCA has presented ample evidence indicating that plants are designed to burn a specific kind of fuel and that "
582,," conversion from one form to another can impose significant costs. The Court is mindful that the Fifth Circuit has defined the 
relevant product market as being ""composed of products that have reasonable interchangability for the purposes for which they 
were produced"" and that ""the outer boundaries of the product market are drawn in terms of the presence of substitutes to which 
consumers will turn in response to price changes (cross-elasticity of demand), [sic] and the ability of other existing producers or 
new entrants to expand output from their present facilities or to build new capacity (elasticity of supply)."" Hornsby Oil Co., Inc. v. 
Champion Spark Plug Co., 714 F.2d 1384, 1393 (5th Cir. 1983). If, in fact, conversion from lignite to alternative fuels is 
economically prohibitive, the Court doubts that significant cross-elasticity of demand exists within the geographic market 
Defendants describe. Nevertheless, the Court need not decide the relevant product market. The ""relevant market"" for antitrust purposes includes both 
the geographic and product markets, and having found that Plaintiff has failed to bear its burden on the former issue, the Court 
concludes that TCA has failed to demonstrate the ""relevant market"" as a whole. See, Southern Business Communications, Inc. 
v. Matsushita Elec. Corp. of America, 806 F. Supp. 950 (N.D. Ga. 1992) (stating that the relevant market for a restraint of trade 
action must include both the relevant geographic and the relevant product market)."
582,7," The Rule of Reason was originally formulated by Justice Brandeis: HN9[
] The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby 
promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question [sic] 
the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and 
after the restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the 
evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all 
relevant facts. This is not because a good intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation, or the reverse; but 
because knowledge of intent may help the court to interpret facts and to predict consequences. Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 38 S. Ct. 242, 244, 62 L. Ed. 683 (1918)."
582,8," In a sense, TCA itself admits this: In order to operate efficiently, and profitably, that is to say to benefit both ratepayers and investors, electric generating 
utilities relying on fossil fuels as an energy source must have secure fuel supplies and supply sources to insure continuous 
production capacity . . . . In turn, the more secure the fossil fuel supply--the more efficient the generating plant. (Plaintiff's Amended Complaint, at 4). "
583,9, HL&P has also agreed to accept a corporate guarantee from TCA's mining contractor if the contractor is of sufficient size. Id.
583,10," Cf. Phillip A. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law s. 736.2b, at 864 (Supp. 1993): A successful ""essential facilities"" plaintiff must prove that denial of access has caused it a severe handicap. . . . As the word 
""essential"" indicates, a plaintiff must show more than inconvenience, or even some economic loss; he must show that an 
alternative to the facility is not feasible. "
584,11," The Court notes with a mixture of regret and amusement in this tortured case that the parties actually present arguments to 
this Court over whether or not Mr. Francis' dog ate all, part, or none of his notes on this issue. (See Defendants' Motion, at 25 
n.18). The Court hardly believes it to be necessary to inform the parties that the conduct of an affiant's pet has no relevance to 
the Court's determination of the legal issues in this case. "

designation. "
618,1," A more detailed account of the facts leading up to the trial of this case appears in this court's opinion reversing the trial court's 
grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant oil companies. See City of Long Beach v. Standard Oil Co., 872 F.2d 1401 
(9th Cir.), modified, 886 F.2d 246 (9th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1076 (1990)."
618,2," Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits ""every contract, combination. . .or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce. . . ."" 15 
U.S.C. § 1."
618,3, The other defendant oil companies all settled with plaintiffs before trail. 
619,4," Instruction 12 reads as follows: You are not limited in your consideration of the evidence to the bare words of the witnesses. You are authorized to draw such 
inferences as are justified in the light of your experience as reasonable persons. An inference is a deduction or conclusion which 
reason and common sense lead one to draw from proved facts. However, the law limits the range of permissible inferences you 
may draw from ambiguous evidence in an antitrust case such as this, and I shall instruct you further on such limitations."
619,5, But see infra pp.1309-10.
619,6, The Manual of Model Jury Instructions for the Ninth Circuit (1985) directs the user to the ABA's instructions. 
620,7," Instruction 38 reads as follows: In order to show the existence of a conspiracy, plaintiffs must present direct or circumstantial evidence that reasonably tends to 
prove a conscious commitment to a common scheme designed to achieve an unlawful objective. It is often difficult to show direct 
evidence of a combination or conspiracy. For this reason, concerted action may be inferred from circumstantial evidence of 
defendant's conduct and course of dealings. However, when relying solely on circumstantial evidence, the evidence must demonstrate that an inference of conspiracy is 
more probable than an inference of independent action. Conduct as consistent with permissible competition as with illegal 
conspiracy does not, standing alone, support an inference of antitrust conspiracy."
620,8," Instruction 58 reads as follows: You have heard evidence concerning three-cut exchanges. Plaintiffs do not assert in this action that three-cut exchanges in and 
of themselves constituted a violation of the antitrust laws. Plaintiffs contend that three-cut exchanges are circumstantial evidence 
of the existence of an unlawful conspiracy to fix, maintain, or stabilize prices of California crude oil and of a conspiracy to 
monopolize. Plaintiffs also contend that Exxon's use of three-cut exchanges is circumstantial evidence of Exxon's joinder in an 
illegal conspiracy. You may consider three-cut exchanges in light of the instructions on circumstantial evidence, but not as an independent violation 
of the antitrust laws. It is the conspiracy, not the three-cut exchanges in and of themselves, which plaintiffs claim caused injury in 
this case. "
621,9," Instruction 31 reads as follows: Plaintiffs in this case seek damages for injury to their business or property, claimed to have been suffered or sustained as a 
result of alleged violations of the antitrust laws of the United States and California by defendant Exxon Corporation and other 
former defendants. As I instructed you at the beginning of this trial, this lawsuit has been disposed of as against ARCO, Union, 
Chevron, Mobil, Shell and Texaco. You should not speculate as to what those dispositions were or the reasons therefor. You 
should not concern yourself with those dispositions. You must decide the case with respect to Exxon solely on the evidence that 
has been introduced at the trial. In this case, plaintiffs claim: First: That Exxon combined and conspired with others to fix, maintain or stabilize artificially low prices for plaintiffs' crude oil, in 
violation of the federal antitrust law, known as Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Second: That Exxon combined and conspired with others to fix, maintain or stabilize artificially low prices for plaintiffs' crude oil, 
in violation of the California antitrust law, known as the Cartwright Act. Third: Plaintiff City of Long Beach, both in its proprietary capacity and as trustee for the State of California, also claims that 
Exxon joined a conspiracy to monopolize trade and commerce in order to control prices and exclude competition in the purchase 
of crude oil produced in California in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The State of California, as a proprietor, 
and the class represented by the State do not make a Section 2 conspiracy to monopolize claim. Fourth: That each of these alleged violations of the federal and state antitrust laws by Exxon was a material cause of damage to 
the plaintiffs' business or property. "
622,10," As additional support for their position, Exxon contends that the plaintiffs argued that GPD's were evidence of the conspiracy 
during their opening and closing statements, and that it could have refuted the plaintiffs' separate GPD claim, but chose not to 
do so."
622,11," The plaintiffs also contend that the remand from this court requires that they prove the defendant conspired to fix the GPD.  
City of Long Beach, 872 F.2d at 1405. The language relied upon by the plaintiffs is that ""the city must convince the trier of fact 
that the companies conspired, or at least acted in conscious parallel, to fix and post artificially high gravity price differentials 
resulting in the plaintiffs receiving artificially low prices for its crude."" City of Long Beach, 872 F.2d at 1405-06. Contrary to the 
plaintiffs' position, this language merely indicates what the jury has to be convinced of in order to find for the plaintiffs, i.e., the 
conspiracy to set artificially high GPD's was evidence that the defendants entered into a conspiracy to fix or maintain low crude 
prices. "
623,12," They also argue that this court's prior opinion ruled on the admissibility of this evidence. Contrary to the plaintiffs' position, 
however, this court's opinion merely recited the evidence the plaintiffs asserted - it did not rule on its admissibility.  872 F.2d at 
1405. "
640,1," Plaintiff asserts that defendants are precluded from challenging plaintiff's market definition because defendants asserted a 
similar definition in a counterclaim. This contention is without merit. Plaintiff has the burden of proof on this issue, and 
defendant's counterclaim allegations do not relieve plaintiff of this burden. Further, defendant's answer denied plaintiff's 
allegations on this subject, which put the matter in issue. Plaintiff also argues that defendants may not now rely on expert 
testimony to disprove plaintiff's definition of the relevant market. This argument is premised on the notion that the relevant 
market is not a fact in issue because of defendants' counterclaim allegations. For the reasons already stated, the Court has 
determined that relevant market is very much in issue, and as such, it is an appropriate subject for expert testimony. "

666,12," RPM also contends that any unauthorized copying of the MLS database constituted ""fair use."" HN6[
] This doctrine allows 
the use of copyrighted materials if the use satisfies a four-part test. The Court must consider (1) the purpose and character of 
the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; (2) the nature of the 
copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the 
effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. 17 U.S.C. § 107. Because RPM only offered 
evidence on the fourth factor, RPM has failed to carry its evidentiary burden. The Court shall therefore reject RPM's ""fair use"" 
argument. "

continued to sell to Klor's, a small competitor. Some of the suppliers capitulated, thereby depriving Klor's of inventory to sell."

] To prove a concerted refusal to deal, RPM must offer proof that no legitimate business purpose existed for MCAR's 
refusal to sell RPM the database. Laurel Sand & Gravel, Inc. v. CSX Transp., Inc., 924 F.2d 539, 542 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 502

L. Ed. 2d 538, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986) (""Conduct as consistent with permissible competition as with illegal conspiracy does not, 
standing alone, support an inference of antitrust conspiracy."") To do this, RPM must first establish that MCAR had a conscious 
commitment to a common scheme designed to achieve an unlawful objective. Laurel, 924 F.2d at 543. Second, RPM ""must 
bring forward evidence that excludes the possibility that the alleged coconspirators acted . . . based upon a legitimate business 
purpose."" Ibid. RPM's failure to offer evidence to support its claim also condemns its group boycott claim."
672,24," Limits upon the uses of a copyright exist. For example, a tying arrangement would violate the antitrust laws regardless of the 
existence of a copyright. The Court, however, has rejected RPM's previous tying claim, see MCAR, 783 F. Supp. at 959-963,

679,4,"  First, a court should determine whether the plaintiff suffered 'antitrust injury'; second, the court should determine whether 
the plaintiff is an efficient enforcer of the antitrust laws, which requires some analysis of the directness or remoteness of the 
plaintiff's injury. Todorov v. DCH Healthcare Authority, 921 F.2d 1438, 1449 (11th Cir. 1991). "
680,5," Although the Sixth Circuit has not so delineated the elements, its test for standing incorporates element three (antitrust injury) 
and element four (standing). Province v. Cleveland Press Pub. Co., 787 F.2d 1047, 1050-51 (6th Cir. 1986) (listing five factors, 
factors one-three addressing antitrust injury and factors four-five addressing whether plaintiff is the best enforcer to redress the 
injury) Since the Seventh Circuit's enunciation does not conflict with any Sixth Circuit standard, the court believes it is free to employ it."
680,6," Although the Seventh Circuit places this question under antitrust injury, in the court's mind, this question is better placed under 
standing because proximate cause implicitly requires a finding of cause-in-fact. If this court were to rewrite the test, it would 
include cause-in-fact under the standing (proximate cause) inquiry."
680,7," Plaintiffs cite Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489, n. 14, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701, 97 S. Ct. 690 (1977). 
This case is inapposite since it concerns a section 7 unlawful merger claim where an effect which ""may"" or ""tend to"" lessen 
competition is sufficient. Id. There is no section 7 claim in the instant case. Furthermore, the Supreme Court has made clear that in section 1 claims, ""the antitrust injury requirement ensures that a plaintiff 
can recover only if the loss stems from a competition-reducing aspect of effect of the defendant's behavior,"" regardless of "
681,," whether the inquiry is a per se or rule of reason analysis. Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U.S. 328, 344, 109 L. 
Ed. 2d 333, 350, 110 S. Ct. 1884 (1990) (emphasis in original)."
681,8," If plaintiffs were able to assert a conspiracy, the relevant market would be radiologists, not radiologic services.  Collins v. 
Associated Pathologists, Ltd., 844 F.2d 473, 478 (7th Cir. 1988). That market would likely be different from the market in which 
the services performed by the instant radiologists are offered.  Id. at 479 (finding the market for pathologists to be nationwide 
and thus that plaintiff had not established the existence of a material fact to support a finding of effect upon competition in the 
relevant market)."
681,9," Morgan, Strand, Wheeler & Biggs v. Radiology, Ltd., 924 F.2d 1484, 1488 (9th Cir. 1991) (granting summary judgment in favor 
of defendant where defendant was radiology group who was awarded exclusive contract with local hospital and plaintiff failed to 
show relevant product and geographic markets). As noted below, the structure of the market has not changed: one exclusive 
radiologic group was replaced with another."
681,10," The court notes that, at oral argument, defense counsel appeared to say that if the market were defined, antitrust injury had 
been alleged. The court believes defense counsel to have meant that although plaintiffs had alleged the type of injury protected 
by the antitrust laws (price and competition), the instant market had not changed."
681,11," The instant plaintiffs assert injury only the market with respect to consumers seeking radiologic services. Complaint, P 10(a). 
Thus, analysis of the market for providers of radiologic services need not be analyzed. However, even if the plaintiffs had 
asserted injury to the market of competitors (i.e., radiologists), the result would be the same. The court's conclusion in Balaklaw 
also applied to the market in which anesthesiologists compete for jobs, which it too found to be unchanged. Balaklaw, 14 F.3d at 
799, 802. "
682,12," The court in Balaklaw considered antitrust injury subsumed within standing, finding ""therefore [that plaintiff] lacks standing to 
prosecute his antitrust claims."" Id."
682,13," The court in Balaklaw was not deterred by the United States Supreme Court decision in Summit Health, supra. Although 
plaintiff in Balaklaw alleged that he was stigmatized by the actions of the hospital in its peer review process, plaintiff had not 
been subjected to a ""sham"" peer review proceeding, as had the plaintiff in Summit Health. Here, and in Balaklaw, plaintiff was 
not subjected to a peer review process but was merely denied practice at the hospital during the duration of the exclusive 
contract with another group of anesthetists. Balaklaw, 14 F.3d at 801. Thus, Summit Health's analysis of group boycott with 
respect to peer review actions is distinguishable from the instant facts as it was in Balaklaw. Balaklaw, 14 F.3d at 801, n. 15-16."
682,14," Bewilderingly, at oral argument, plaintiffs' counsel stated that plaintiffs are not challenging the exclusive contract. Instead, they 
challenge post-contractual actions admonishing plaintiffs not to compete. However, the ability of the plaintiffs to challenge 
actions taken to enforce a contract perforce depends upon the validity of the contract sought to be enforced. Since counsel's 
statement would defeat his clients' cause, the court will ignore it. "

687,4," In fact, at oral argument, when asked to state specifically what evidence supported their case, counsel for the plaintiffs pointed 
only to the affidavits of their experts."
687,5," The plaintiffs argue on appeal that, although the plaintiffs retained ownership of the mineral estate, the petroleum companies 
""locked up"" their properties by acquiring exclusive ingress and egress easements to the mineral estates as part of the buyout 
program. In the district court, the plaintiffs advanced the proposition (via their expert in his affidavit) that the purchase of any 
interest in real property effectively ""locked up"" the hydrocarbon storage facility development rights, and that forcing conveyance 
of the ingress and egress rights to the mineral estate merely solidified that control."
687,6," The plaintiffs supplied this product definition, and the defendants stipulated to this definition in their motion for summary 
judgment."
687,7," The plaintiffs also argue that the program's requirement that the plaintiffs convey an exclusive easement of access to the 
mineral estate enabled the companies to ""lock up"" the properties for hydrocarbon storage facility development, further depriving 
them of a competitive market in which to sell their product. "
688,8," Areeda and Turner, for instance, comment that distinguishing among antitrust injury, causation, and standing ""is often 
pointless,"" and note that the Supreme Court ""often uses one term to include another."" ¶ 334.3 (1993 supp.)."
688,9," The terms ""monopsony"" and ""oligopsony"" refer to the reverse of the more familiar terms ""monopoly"" and ""oligopoly. In the usual 
antitrust case, buyers complain about oppression from one or a few sellers using their market power to reduce ""bout monopsony 
or oligopsony situation, sellers complain about oppression from one or a few buyers. Whether the oppressive conduct comes at 
the hands of the sellers [*15]  or buyers, the effect is the same: a diversion of resources from their highest and best uses, to the 
detriment of society. See Richard A. Posner and Fran Easterbrook, Antitrust 148-150 (1981); Roger D. Blair an y L. Harrison, 
Antitrust Policy and Monopsony, 76 Cornell L. Rev. 297 (1991). Posner and Easterbrook explain that ""[t]he ability monopsonize 
depends on the existence of resources having substantially greater value in some uses than others,"" and conjecture that, 
because most resources have more than one use, the probability that a monopsony or oligopsony can wield substantial power is 
remote. Id. at 150. Because the plaintiffs theory posits that their real estate has only one use, this case could present, in theory, 
the exceptional situation in which a monopsony or oligopsony quite possibly could wield substantial power. However, as 
developed below, we find no evidence that the companies did so."
688,10," Although they are analytically distinct, the plaintiffs' § 1 and § 2 claims depend on the same acts. Accordingly, if we determine 
that the plaintiffs have failed to produce evidence of antitrust injury to support its § 1 claim--the buying cartel or oligopsony claim- "
689,," -it follows that they lack standing to assert § 2 claims--the monopsony claim--as well. See J.T. Gibbons, Inc. v. Crawford Fitting 
Co., 704 F.2d 787, 797 (5th Cir. 1983)."
689,11," The plaintiffs also argue that the district court's analysis did not properly consider the relevant market. (The companies 
stipulated in their motion for summary judgment to the plaintiffs' definition of the relevant market, i.e., real property on the salt 
dome that is suitable for the development of hydrocarbon storage facilities.) We agree that the district court's references to the 
relevant market could have been clearer, but we find the record sufficiently clear that, on plenary review and in the light of our 
determination that the plaintiffs produced no evidence of an antitrust injury, the district court committed no reversible error in this 
respect."
689,12," As explained in footnotes 5 and 7, the plaintiffs argue that the fact that the buyout program required them to convey 
easements giving the defendant companies exclusive access to the mineral estates means that the defendant companies, 
through the buyout program, ""locked up"" the properties for development [*20]  in the indefinite future. It is clear to us that the 
required conveyance of easements does not help to establish an antitrust injury. To the extent that obtaining the easements might otherwise allow an inference that the companies have some interest in future 
development, we find such an inference m this case to b improbable and in any event of no significant weight in the light of 
competing inferences that might be drawn from the context. Cf. Matsushita, 475 U.S at 587, 106 S.Ct. at 1356. conveyances of 
real property include an easement of access to the mineral estate when, as in these conveyances, the seller retains the right to 
the mineral estate. By obtaining the easements access, the defendant companies have acted reasonably to ensure that, if the 
plaintiffs decide to convey or otherwise to expliot their respective mineral estates, the use of the surface estate will not be at the 
mercy of the mineral estate owners. Thus, the fact remains that the plaintiffs have pointed to no evidence suggesting that the defendant companies have or will have 
any desire, demand, or economic motive to develop additional hydrocarbon storage facilities. On these facts, then, and without "
690,," ""more persuasive evidence,"" id., we decline to infer any [*21]  anticompetitive intent or effect from the conveyance of the 
easements of access."
690,13," ""All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and 
enforce contracts . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens."" § 1981(a). That right extends to ""the making, performance, 
modification, [*22]  and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms and conditions of the 
contractual relationship."" § 1981(b)."
690,14," Section 1982 provides that ""all citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every state and territory, as is 
enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property."""
690,15," Claude Hamilton, the plaintiffs' acknowledged spokesman, explained on direct examination that the all-or-nothing requirement 
prompted the residents of Pablo Street to accept the buyout offer: Q. Did the requirement that all the people sell or nobody sell, did that cause conflict within the community? A. I don't know whether it caused conflict, but I know it was a decision that we had to make among ourselves, and rather 
one to go against the other, we would accept most anything. Q. So because some of the people were truly frightened and wanted to get out of there, the rest of the people didn't want to 
hold up the deal? A. Right. Q. And did that make people feel like they they were being forced to accept something they didn't want? A. Yes. Without a choice. "
691,16," On direct examination, Hamilton testified: I went up to the meeting and they had the meeting telling the people on the hill [the residents within the designated area of 
the main buyout program] that they were going to buy them out. * * * I thought we [Pablo Street residents] were left out, but when they closed with their meeting, the same man that got me up, 
which was [*27]  Art Spencer, had carried me up to the room, he got up and made the statement that they would be buying 
out the Warren Addition or Pablo Street."
691,17," Hamilton testified that he met with representatives of Chevron and Warren after the main meeting. In relevant part, the 
testimony was as follows: Q. Did you express a concern about the all-or-nothing aspect of the buyout that everybody had to sell or they wouldn't buy 
anybody? A. Yes. Q. And what was their response to that? A. This was the stipulation of the buyout for the Pablo Street, that it would be one hundred percent, two miles away, or lose 
your ten percent, or do not -- or they wouldn't buy nobody out. "
692,18," BOH Q. Did you complain to Art Spencer that the two mile restriction, the all or nothing restriction was different than the program 
that was being offered to the white people on the top of the hill? A. Yes, I did. Q. Did he have any explanation as to why they were treating people on the top of the hill differently than the people on 
Pablo Street? A. No more than this was the plan that Warren had accepted or leave it. Q. ""That's just the way it is, and you're going to have to accept it""; is that correct? A. Yes."
692,19," The plaintiffs characterize Hamilton's use of ""discrimination"" as a synonym for unfairness, and assert that he was complaining 
about the general unfairness of the terms offered by Warren, but not indicating awareness of a civil rights violation. At trial, 
Hamilton was not cross-examined as to the meaning of his statement to the reporter. When asked, however, to explain the basis 
of his feeling that Warren Petroleum had discriminated against the Pablo Street community, Hamilton responded I really think [Warren] felt like they [*30]  had done such a good job on us the first time [referring to the move in 1958] that 
they would try it again. And this was a group of people--and I use this term loosely--was not a fighting bunch of people. I 
don't know how anybody could present this kind of thing to them, racially. This is the only thing I say, because there was no 
other place for us to go. In the light of this subsequent explanation at trial, Hamilton's statement to the newspaper reporter is naturally read to reflect a 
view that racial animus existed on the part of Warren. It is, however, neither probative of nor responsive to the question of his 
knowledge that the terms of the respective buyouts were different."
692,20," The residents argue that they did not become aware of the alleged discrimination, and their causes of action did not accrue, 
until they saw white people moving into areas within two miles of Pablo Street (areas off-limits to them by the terms of their 
buyout) some time after April 2, 1987. In addition to being inconsistent with the evidence, this argument, we think, is incomplete: 
although it might explain the means by which the plaintiffs became aware that the distance requirement was in fact "
693,," discriminatory, [*31]  it fails to explain when the plaintiffs became aware of the allegedly discriminatory all-or-nothing 
requirement."
693,21," The residents rely on Suthoff v. Yazoo County Indus. Dev. Corp., 722 F.2d 133 (5th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1206, 
104 S. Ct. 2389, 81 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1984) . We do not read Suthoff to require a departure from the principle that the cause of 
action accrues when the plaintiffs first know or have reason to know of the injury that forms the basis of their claims. In Suthoff, a 
cause of action under § 1983 for civil conspiracy involving the transfer of real estate accrued upon closing. The facts in Suthoff, 
however, showed that the closing date was the date the plaintiffs knew or had reason to know of the injury that was the basis of 
the claim. 722 F.2d at 138. Instead of standing for the wooden proposition that a claim for discrimination in the transfer of 
property claim accrues upon closing, then, we read Suthoff [*33]  to reflect the principle we apply here. "

720,38," The behavior of Mrs. Casassas ended the friendship between the Joneses and the Casassas. In the spring/early summer of 
1985 Mrs. Casassa and a friend traveled from Florida to Caledonia, New York, to satisfy Mrs. Casassa's curiosity about Bob 
Jones's marital status. Representing themselves as reporters for the St. Petersburg Times, they located Bob Jones's residence 
and took photographs. Upon confronting Mr. Jones they demanded that he get Shirley Jones out of town. When they returned to 
Florida Mrs. Casassa told her husband and gossiped to her friends about Bob Jones. Mr. Jones voiced his objections over 
Loraine Casassa's invasion of his privacy and her subsequent rumor-mongering to Mr. Casassa. The friendship between the 
couples ended. As a result Mr. Jones ""threatened"" the Casassas. His alleged ""threat"" was in reference to the Casassas' interference with his 
personal life. It had nothing to do with their business dealings. Plaintiffs argue the ""threat"" pertained to business dealings 
between Jones and the Casassas' firm, Chemicals, Inc. Chemicals, Inc. is not a defendant in the instant case. It only bid in the 
Florida panhandle area. Any relationship between Bob Jones of Jones Chemicals and the Casassas of Chemicals, Inc. has no 
probative value as to whether there was a conspiracy in Alabama. Furthermore, the Casassas seemed to understand that the 
""threat"" involved their meddling in the personal relationship between Bob and Shirley Jones. Moreover, any threat made by Mr. "
721,," Jones to the Casassas is inadmissible against the defendants for the following reasons: 1) The evidence does not establish a 
conspiracy; 2) Mr. Jones's statements could not have furthered the alleged conspiracy; and 3) The alleged statements do not 
identify any defendant as a conspirator."

particularly resale price maintenance, would make it easier to police a cartel of manufacturers, but that seems a pretty thin basis

] Economic arrangements between competitors performing similar functions in the production or sale of comparable 
goods or services are characterized as ""horizontal."" Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 334, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 1529, 
8 L.Ed. 2d 510, 541 (1962). In this case Ideal does not allege that defendants agreed to fix a minimum or maximum price 
applicable to all customers or engaged in some other concerted action that could be characterized as a horizontal market 
restraint. Rather, the claim was that defendants agreed to charge preferential prices to Ideal's customers in order to damage 
Ideal. This generally comes under the rubric of ""price discrimination"" or ""primary line injury"" and is prohibited under federal law 
as a violation of the Robinson-Patman Act. E.g. Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209,    , 113 
S. Ct. 2578, 2586, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168, 184 (1993); Ashkanazy v. I. Rokeach & Sons, Inc., 757 F. Supp. 1527, 1556 (N.D.Ill.1991). 
In Brooke Group, the Supreme Court acknowledged that primary-line competitive injury under the Robinson-Pactman Act is of "
763,," the ""same general character as the injury inflicted by predatory pricing schemes actionable under § 2 of the Sherman Act"" 
(prohibiting conspiracies to monopolize) and may also be analyzed as a § 2 claim. Ideal did not plead or pursue a Sherman Act 
§ 2 violation. "
767,3," Although Farmland generally denies there was a conspiracy, it does not argue this point at length in its brief. However, Ideal's 
deficiency of proof on this issue is both noteworthy and significant since ""[u]nilateral action, no matter what its motivation, cannot 
violate [section] 1"" of the Sherman Act. Edward J. Sweeney & Sons, Inc. v. Texaco, Inc., 637 F.2d 105, 110 (3d Cir.1980). We question whether there was sufficient evidence from which to infer that Farmland and the co-defendant distributors 
agreed to enter into a conspiracy the intent of which was to restrain competition. The judge relied upon the fact that ""no one 
ultimately complained about Ferrante signing their names"" to DDI-11 change forms. Evidence of specific acts may provide 
a basis from which to infer agreement among alleged conspirators. Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States, 306 U.S. 208, 
226-27, 59 S. Ct. 467, 473-74, 83 L. Ed. 610 620 (1939); State v. New Jersey Trade Waste Ass'n, 96 N.J. 8, 19, 472 A.2d 
1050 (1984). However, the evidence here is tenuous at best. The fact that there was a joint solicitation effort among entities selling a common product, and that the co-defendant 
distributors acquiesced in Farmland's acquisition of customers on their behalf, does not necessarily imply that the 
distributors acquiesced in a predatory pricing scheme. Neither does the evidence necessarily imply that they knowingly 
entered into an agreement to restrain competition, or intended that their actions would have that effect. In light of the 
evidence that the distributors were themselves often the object of solicitation campaigns by competing dairies, the 
distributors agreement to ""join forces"" with Farmland for solicitation purposes appears more reasonably motivated by a 
desire to compete effectively for new business. "
773,4," Conduct evincing such malice included: 1) making threats to damage Ideal; 2) failing to counter-offer after Ideal met Farmland's 
offers to its customers; 3) offering prices which were lower than necessary to close the sale; and 4) signing dealers' names on 
change notices. The judge believed that this evidence established that Farmland's true motive was not to engage in ""real"" 
competition, but solely to damage Ideal. Whether intending to take away Ideal's customers, or to damage Ideal, Farmland was 
attempting to gain a competitive edge. The only issue was whether the competitive means chosen by Farmland were prohibited 
by the doctrine of tortious interference. "

most Tennessee courts of general sessions in civil cases. T.C.A. § 16-15-501(d)(1)."
784,2," It makes no difference to the outcome of this case whether the defendants assert federal-question jurisdiction of the subject 
matter under the general statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1331, or under 28 U.S.C. § 1337(a), which applies more specifically to claims 
""arising under any Act of Congress regulating commerce or protecting trade and commerce against restraints and monopolies."" "
785,3," It is noteworthy that in In re Wiring Device Antitrust Litigation, supra, the district court found diversity jurisdiction to exist,

appeals applied the middle burden of proof to a civil action for violation of the administrative regulations relating to Wisconsin's 
Unfair Trade Practices Act; sec. 100.20 declares violations of regulations punishable as crimes. The question of the appropriate

criminal conduct.  State ex rel. Flowers v. H&SS Dept., 81 Wis. 2d 376, 387-88, 260 N.W.2d 727 (1978). For discussions of the higher standard of proof in civil cases, see Note, Appellate Review in the Federal Courts of Findings

damages.  Peissig v. Wis. Gas Co., 155 Wis. 2d 686, 696, 456 N.W.2d 348 (1990). Furthermore, in a punitive damage case the 
middle burden is applicable only to determine punitive damages, not compensatory damages.  Wangen v. Ford Motor Co., 97

797,30," Aside from the higher material prices, there was evidence of the plaintiff's profits and losses for various years but the amount 
of loss of profits caused by Lampert Yards was not shown in any detail except for the increased cost of materials."
797,31," The plaintiff's expert, Professor J.R. Nevin, calculated the overcharge based upon the depositions, the plaintiff's financial 
statements, interviews with plaintiff's principals and accountant, and market data regarding the construction industry in Door 
county. He estimated the percentages of purchases made by the plaintiff from Lampert Yards and then assumed and assigned 
different percentages of overcharges to the plaintiff compared to charges to Portside Properties and DCMS. In addition he added 
an ""inflation adjustment factor which increased each year's overcharge figure to a present day value."" Using the calculation of a 
15% overcharge to the plaintiff compared to the charges to the other defendants, professor Nevin concluded that the overcharge 
was $ 354,200; using a 10% calculation of overcharge resulted in damages of $ 236,134; and using a 5% calculation of 
overcharge resulted in damages of a total of $ 118,067. Professor Nevin's calculations did not include damages for specific lost 
sales to Portside Properties or damages for lost profits or lost reputation. "
798,32," Indeed the jury was instructed that ""the determination of damages cannot in many instances, such as in the loss of profits, be 
made exactly or with mathematical precision. You should award damages which will fairly compensate the named party for its 
injuries. The amount to be inserted by you in answer to the damage question is for you to determine from the evidence. . . . 
Examine the evidence carefully and dispassionately and determine your answer from the evidence in the case."""
798,33," For example, the plaintiff asserts that the jury could have determined the price differential was 15% but could have accepted 
various aspects of the defendants' evidence that the plaintiff would not have realized the full 15%."
798,34," HN11[
] Three kinds of ""jury compromises"" on damages are described in the cases and should be distinguished: A ""jury 
compromise"" on damages in a case of unliquidated damages; a ""jury compromise"" on damages in a case in which the damages 
are liquidated or the defendant does not contest the damages; and a ""compromise verdict."" "
799,," In a case where damages are unliquidated and there is conflicting evidence, a jury may reach a figure that lies somewhere 
between the parties' claims. Such a verdict, if supported by the evidence, can stand.  National Fire Ins. Co. v. Great Lakes 
Warehouse Corp., 261 F.2d 35, 37-38 (7th Cir. 1958). In a case where damages are liquidated, that is, mathematically calculable with certainty, or uncontested by the opposing party, 
a jury verdict of one-half what the injured party claims (or some other figure substantially less than what that party asserts) 
shows that the jury did not consider the evidence and that the jury compromised between the right of recovery and the amount of 
recovery. Such a verdict cannot stand.  National Fire Ins. Co. v. Great Lakes Warehouse Corp., 261 F.2d 35, 37-38 (7th Cir. 
1958). A ""compromise verdict"" occurs when the jury, unable to agree on liability, compromises that disagreement and enters a grossly 
low award of damages. This compromise verdict between liability and recovery cannot stand.  Yarbrough v. Sturm, Ruger & Co., 
964 F.2d 376, 378-79 (5th Cir. 1992); Pagan v. Shoney's Inc., 931 F.2d 334, 339 (5th Cir. 1991); National R.R. Passenger Corp 
v. Koch Industries, 701 F.2d 108, 110 (10th Cir. 1983). "
807,1," By order dated January 23, 1995, Hitachi America, Ltd. was dismissed from this action. "
808,2," Prior to 1989, Hitachi Data was known as National Advanced Systems (""NAS"")."
808,3," In 1984, Hitachi began distributing 7380 series DASDs. In 1989, model 7390 replaced model 7380. The 7600 series has since 
replaced the 7390 models. "
809,4," BABSS defines the ""Market"" as the maintenance servicing of Hitachi DASDs in the United States. Hitachi disputes BABSS' 
market definition. However, Hitachi assumes for purposes of this motion only, that BABSS' market definition is accurate."
809,5," The supply contracts are attached as Exhibits A, B and C to the Reply declaration of Yoshihiro Koshimizu filed in support of 
Hitachi's Motion for Summary Judgment. "
810,6," Section 1 of the Sherman Act states in relevant part: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or 
conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. 
§ 1"
810,7," Section 2 of the Sherman Act states: ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire 
with any other person or person, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign 
nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding one million

Hitachi owns all other copyrights protecting CUDG in the United States, as well as all copyrights governing other versions of 
INLINE (and rights to version E04 outside of the United States). Hitachi also owns all copyrights protecting Hitachi's

810,9," Maintenance manuals were shipped with the equipment while Hitachi Data was under the name NAS. Hart Decl., Exh.'s 3, 4."
810,10," NAS left maintenance manuals at customer sites and did not remove manuals after the customer discontinued maintenance 
with NAS. Hart Decl., Exh.'s 3, 4. "
811,11," Copies of diagnostic software were shipped with the equipment while the company was NAS. Hart Decl., Exh.'s 3, 4. Until 
1990, diagnostic diskettes were not consistently labeled with copyright notices or proprietary labels. Id., Exh.'s 7, 18. "
813,12," The Court notes also that Service & Training rejected the Ninth Circuit's holding in Image Technical Service, Inc. v. Eastman

828,1," Leopold has filed a brief in support of each of its motions and a succinct reply brief. Roberts Filter has filed a single, one 
hundred and ten (110) page brief in opposition to Leopold's motions. After oral argument, Leopold filed an Outline of Leopold's

Reply to Matters Raised by Leopold for the First Time at Oral Argument, a Supplemental Memorandum in Opposition to 
Leopold's Motion for Summary Judgment on Anti-trust Counterclaims, and a Reply Outline in Opposition to Summary Judgment 
on Anti-trust Claims."
828,2," The second patent at issue is also a patent for ""Cap for Underdrains in Gravity Filters."" This patent is numbered 5,232,592 and 
is referred to by the parties as the ""592 patent."" (See Volume II of Roberts Filter's Exhibits, Exhibit 115)"
828,3," IMS (Integral Media Support System) ""consists of a molded high molecular weight, high density polyethelen [sic] cap designed

831,4," This section provides: HN9[
] One who is required by law to publish defamatory matter is absolutely privileged to publish it. Restatement (Second) of Torts § 592A (1977). "
832,5," In support of the public concern argument, Leopold directs the Court to the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 598. This section 
provides: HN11[
] An occasion makes a publication conditionally privileged if the circumstances induce a correct or reasonable 
belief that (a) there is information that affects a sufficiently important public interest, and (b) the public interest requires the communication of the defamatory matter to a public officer or a private citizen who is 
authorized or privileged to take action if the defamatory matter is true. Restatement of Torts (Second) § 598 (1977). "
834,6," McIlvaine stated during his deposition: Q: Does this document help refresh your recollection that Leopold's [sic] specifically was attempting to make the 592 Patent 
cover Roberts' design? … A: I would agree to the extent that both myself and Leopold were conscious at the time of the fact that the claims which we 
were pursuing would, in addition to the 427 Patent, cover the Roberts' design. Deposition of John McIlvaine, August 20, 1993, p. 314, Volume II of Roberts Filter's Exhibits, Exhibit 111. "
836,7," This disposition does not preclude Roberts Filter from pursuing Count II of its Counterclaim under section 43 (a) of the Lanham 
Act."
836,8," Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery and Chemical Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 86 S. Ct. 347, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1965). "
837,9, McIlvaine is also counsel of record in this case. 
844,10," HN33[
] If all of the prerequisites to a section 2 claim are shown, then a patent owner can be liable for enforcement of a patent known to be procured by fraud. Walker Process Equip. Inc. v. Food Mach. & Chem. Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 174, 15 L. Ed. 
2d 247, 86 S. Ct. 347 (1965). Since we have determined that Roberts Filter has failed to allege facts sufficient to withstand 
summary judgment on the section 2 claim, the Walker Process claim must necessarily be dismissed."
844,11," The Universal Underdrain was originally patented in 1977. The patent expired in December, 1994. "
852,1," Some businesses, such as plaintiffs Porterfield Towing Service, Inc., and Rials Muffler and Auto, engaged in both towing and 
storage. Other businesses, such as Shreveport Salvage Pool, did not have their own tow trucks but provided storage for those 
towing companies that did not have their own storage facilities. "
856,2," Having concluded that plaintiffs have not been deprived of a protected property or liberty interest, the court has no occasion to 
consider what procedural protections would have been required in the event that such an interest was present. However, it 
should be noted that no plaintiff contends that it was deprived of an opportunity to bid for the central storage facility, and 
everyone agrees that a public hearing on the proposed 1994 amendments was held before the city council in October, 1994. A 
number of the plaintiffs attended the hearing and objected to the proposed central storage facility, while others present argued in 
favor of the proposed change. "
858,3," Plaintiffs argue that the is no Louisiana statute which codifies the rule of reason. The court observes that neither is there a 
federal statute which codifies this rule. Read literally, both the Sherman Act and the state statutes prohibit every combination in 
restraint of trade. However, the recognized purpose of antitrust laws is to prohibit only unreasonable and harmful anticompetitive 
practices. The notion that Louisiana antitrust law should be totally divorced from any type of reasonableness inquiry is 
untenable. In the words of Chief Justice White, the absence of a reasonableness limitation could require the conclusion that the 
Sherman Act forbids virtually ""every conceivable contract or combination…anywhere in the whole field of human activity."" 
Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States, 221 U.S. 1, 60, 31 S. Ct. 502, 516, 55 L. Ed. 619 (1911). The court is unwilling 
to attribute such an intention to the Louisiana Legislature. "
860,4," In connection with their First Amendment claims, plaintiffs make other arguments that the statute is being applied in a manner 
that is constitutionally overbroad. Those arguments are addressed below in the portion of the report and recommendation which 
considers plaintiffs' First Amendment claims. "
861,5," Plaintiff has provided the Court with a copy of an unreported district court decision from Civil District Court for the Parish of 
Orleans, Rudy Smith Service, Inc. v. City of New Orleans, No. 90-13280, in which the district judge enjoined the enforcement of 
a New Orleans towing ordinance on a number of grounds, including state law preemption. The basis of the preemption holding 
was that licensing fees charged under the city ordinance were in excess of the licensing fees which may be charged by the 
LPSC under R.S. 45:180.1. This decision was issued in 1992, and apparently was not appealed. The present case does not 
involve a dispute over licensing fees. Also, the district court did not have the benefit of the state supreme court's 1994 decision in 
City of New Orleans v. Board of Com'rs, a ruling which conceivably could have impacted its preemption analysis. "
863,6," For the same reason, the court is unpersuaded by plaintiffs' argument that the no solicitation provision is overbroad because it 
could be interpreted as preventing a private ""good samaritan"" from offering towing assistance to the operator of a disabled 
vehicle. As reasonably interpreted, the term ""solicitation"" refers to solicitation for hire, and not an act of charitable assistance."
863,7," The only matter before the court is plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction. While plaintiffs' claims for declaratory and 
permanent injunctive relief, if pursued, may involve much of the same evidence and identical legal issues, disposition of those 
claims will require additional proceedings. "
876,1," Even though the Court has granted summary judgment as to all federal antitrust claims, for the purposes of judicial economy 
the Court will exercise its discretion to address all pendent state claims. See United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 
715, 726, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218, 86 S. Ct. 1130 (1966)."
876,2," Gale Levine is President, Chief Operating Officer, and owner of Marina Shores. David Levine has assigned his litigation rights 
in this case to his wife and is not a party to this action."
876,3," The lease included a provision increasing the base rent to $ 6,666.66 per month after August 30, 1991. "
877,4," McLeskey also agreed to provide Cohn-Phillips with a line of credit up to $ 150,000 secured by a deed of trust on Norman 
Cohn's home."
877,5," McLeskey claims the rent was late because it was based on a percentage of net sales and substantial calculations had to be 
made in order to determine the amount of rent actually due."
877,6," See VA. CODE ANN. §§ 18.2-499 and 500 (Michie 1994). Plaintiffs allege that McLeskey violated these same laws in the 
instant suit. "
878,7," This lis pendens was filed in conjunction with the lawsuit Cohn-Phillips, Ltd. v. David I. Levine and Gale M. Levine, Chancery 
No. CH92-2467. Defendant's counsel claims this action was filed because some of the counts contained in the identically styled 
law action ""would be more properly considered on the equity side of court."" (Isbrandtsen Aff. at P 11, Ex. 13 in Vol. VI of Ex. in 
Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J.)"
878,8," Isbrandtsen later moved to dismiss the chancery suit and release the second lis pendens. The reinstated first lis pendens was 
eventually quashed on November 30, 1992."
878,9," The parties had escrowed rent in a joint account through May 1992. After that month, Cohn-Phillips claimed an offset due to the 
jury's financial verdict in their favor. (Pls.' Br. in Resp. to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 166.)"
878,10," See Marina Shores, Ltd. v. Cohn-Phillips, Ltd., 246 Va. 222, 435 S.E.2d 136 (1993). "
879,11," For example, plaintiffs claim that: As the controlling shareholder of Cohn-Phillips, McLeskey encouraged the operation of Hoppers in a manner designed to 
interfere with the operations of Marina Shores. . . . McLeskey's unlawful actions had an anticompetitive effect. By destroying Marina Shore's business and it ability to borrow 
money, McLeskey prevented Marina Shores from providing all the amenities which Marina Shores was designed to offer, 
such as a compatible restaurant (albeit without a raucous, bawdy atmosphere). (Pls.' Br. in Resp. to Def's Mot. for Summ. J. at 176.) "
880,12," For this reason the Court declines to apply the doctrine of res judicata (claim preclusion) to this case. HN5[
] Under this 
doctrine ""[a] valid, personal judgment on the merits in favor of the defendant bars relitigation of the Same cause of action, or any 
part thereof which could have been litigated between the same parties and their privies."" Bates, 202 S.E.2d at 920 (emphasis 
added)."
880,13, (Ex. 14. in Vol. 1 of Ex. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J.) 
881,14," Nor could they, according to the Court's understanding of Virginia law. Generally, a court's judgment is invalid only when it 
should not have decided the case. See, e.g., In re Dwyer, 18 Va. App. 437, 445 S.E.2d 157, 158 (1994) (stating that: ""No court 
can 'render a valid judgment when necessary parties to a proceeding are not before the court.'"")(citation omitted); Patterson v. 
Anderson, 194 Va. 557, 74 S.E.2d 195, 202 (1953) (stating: ""A valid judgment cannot be predicated upon a complaint which 
does not state a cause of action."")."
881,15," Virginia courts have sometimes also required HN7[
] mutuality of estoppel, meaning that ""one cannot assert collateral 
estoppel unless he would have been similarly precluded had the prior litigation of the issue reached the opposite result."" Bates, 
202 S.E.2d at 921. The court finds that mutuality of estoppel also exists in this case."
881,16," Since the Court has determined that the litigation was not a sham, there is no need to determine whether McLeskey 
authorized the lawsuits in question. "
882,17," The relevant part of Virginia Code § 55-225 states: If any tenant or lessee of premises in a city or town . . . being in default in the payment of rent, shall so continue for five 
days after notice, in writing, requiring the possession of the premises or the payment of rent, such tenant or lessee shall 
thereby forfeit his right to the possession. In such case the possession of the defendant may, at the option of the landlord or 
lessor, be deemed unlawful, and he may proceed to recover [possession]. VA. CODE ANN. § 55-255 (Michie 1994). "
883,18," Recall that the parties had escrowed rent in a joint account through May 1992. After that month, Cohn-Phillips claimed an 
offset due to the jury's financial verdict in their favor. (Pls.' Br. in Resp. to Def's Mot. for Summ. J. at 166.)"
883,19," The United States Supreme Court went on to state ""The notion of probable cause . . . requires the plaintiff to prove that the 
defendant lacked probable cause to institute an unsuccessful civil lawsuit and that the defendant pressed the action for an 
improper, malicious purpose."" Id. However, Cohn-Phillips has stayed the litigation pending the resolution of the instant case. 
(See Pls.' Br. in Resp. to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 164; Br. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. on Pl.'s Antitrust Claims at 80.)"
883,20," The Court notes that the Virginia Beach Circuit Court granted Cohn-Phillips' demurrer, overruled Marina Shores' demurrer, 
and dismissed the detinue action. "
884,21," Likewise, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, in Oksanen v. Page Memorial Hospital, 945 F.2d 696, 702 (4th Cir. 1991), 
stated: To prove a violation of section one of the Sherman Act . . . a plaintiff must show the existence of an agreement in the form 
of a contract, combination, or conspiracy that imposes and unreasonable restraint on trade. . . . Proof of concerted action 
requires evidence of a relationship between at least two legally distinct persons or entities."
884,22," Anticompetitive acts which have been deemed illegal per se include ""horizontal price-fixing, division of markets, resale price 
maintenance, tying arrangements and group boycotts."" KINTNER, § 9.20 at 57-58. Plaintiffs have not alleged any activities "
885,," which the Court deems are illegal per se, and therefore, the Court proceeds under the Rule of Reason. See Board of Trade v. 
United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 62 L. Ed. 683, 38 S. Ct. 242 (1918) (explaining the Rule of Reason)."
885,23," The Court notes that the Westchester court, citing Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 483-84, 73 L. Ed. 2d 
149, 102 S. Ct. 2540 (1982), held that ""an antitrust plaintiff need not be either a competitor or a consumer in the relevant market 
in order to have antitrust standing. However, based on the language of Associated General Contractors, 459 U.S. at 539, this 
Court declines to adopt the Westchester court's maxim."
885,24," As the Fourth Circuit stated in Wilder Enterprises v. Allied Artists Pictures, 632 F.2d 1135 (4th Cir. 1980): ""The necessary 
elements for recovery under § 1 of the Act are: (1) an agreement, conspiracy, or combination among the defendants in restraint 
of trade; (2) injury to the plaintiff's business and property as a direct result; (3) damages that are capable of reasonable 
ascertainment and are not speculative or conjectural."" Id. at 1139 (emphasis added). "
886,25," Since Lynnhaven Marine only has dry slip capacity, the Court need not examine the figures for wet slips or total slips. "
887,26," Although Virginia has a defamation statute, Va. Code § 8.01-45, which states that ""all words shall be actionable which from 
their usual construction and common acceptance are construed as insults and tend to violence and breach of the peace,"" 
plaintiffs do not sue under this statute. Instead, they rely on the common law tort of defamation. "
888,27," The Court recognizes that in early January, less than one month before this case was scheduled for trial, the Magistrate Judge 
granted plaintiff leave to take the deposition of Jay Archbell. To date, the deposition has not been taken. The Court must base its 
ruling on the record before it."
888,28," As stated above, only Levine can seek relief on this claim of defamation. "
890,29," The Court notes that this is not a case of republication, as can happen in a claim for defamation. In this slander of property 
claim, the issue in this case, the lis pendens, is the original publication that allegedly damaged the property."
890,30," A claim of malicious prosecution based upon the first lis pendens is barred by the statute of limitations. The catch-all statute of 
limitations in Virginia is Va. Code § 8.01-248, which establishes a one year statute of limitations for actions not otherwise 
covered by a statute of limitations, such as malicious prosecution actions. Since the first lis pendens was finally quashed by 
order entered November 30, 1992, and plaintiffs brought this action on May 20, 1994, the statute of limitations had run. A claim 
of malicious prosecution based upon the second lis pendens is not barred, since it was not released until November 3, 1993. "
891,31," The Court notes that plaintiffs are suing McLeskey in his personal capacity for prosecutions for which he was not a party. 
Cohn-Phillips was the party involved in bringing the counterclaims, the claim for piercing the corporate veil, and the claim and lis 
pendens regarding the land Marina Shores sits upon. Plaintiffs are alleging that the actions were ""procured by the cooperation 
of"" McLeskey. Pallas v. Zaharopoulos, 219 Va. 751, 754, 250 S.E.2d 357, 359 (1979). Plaintiffs would have to show McLeskey 
had some control over the litigation or some significant involvement in the litigation at issue in order to be liable personally for 
malicious prosecution of an action brought by Cohn-Phillips. To fairly hold him accountable, McLeskey would need to be the 
""alter ego"" of Cohn-Phillips. See, Freezer v. Miller, 163 Va. 180, 200, 176 S.E. 159, 166 (1934). As discussed previously, there 
is sufficient evidence that McLeskey in fact controlled Cohn-Phillips. "
892,32," A lis pendens does not qualify. Bray v. Landergren, 161 Va. 699, 713, 172 S.E. 252 (1934)."
892,33," Note that in Ely v. Whitlock, 238 Va. 670, 385 S.E.2d 893 (1989), a case of malicious prosecution based upon disciplinary 
proceedings against a lawyer, the Supreme Court of Virginia held that anxiety, great mental anguish, and unusual and 
unnecessary stress that threatened the plaintiff's physical well being are injuries that would normally stem from a disciplinary 
complaint ""Anyone whose livelihood is threatened by such a proceeding would necessarily feel some degree of mental anguish. 
Therefore, they do not sufficiently allege special injury."" Id. at 674. "
893,34," McLeskey also alleges that this claim is barred by the statute of limitations. The Court disagrees, because the claim is for an 
ongoing injury caused by continued exposure to McLeskey's alleged conduct. "
895,35," McLeskey claims that the breach occurred regarding the May rent, due June 1, 1991, and that the evidence supports only the 
conclusion that it took a couple of extra days to calculate their percentage rent. However, the Supreme Court of Virginia ruled on 
this issue in Marina Shores, Ltd. v. Cohn-Phillips, Ltd., 246 Va. 222, 435 S.E.2d 136 (1993). It found that, as plaintiffs contend, 
Cohn-Phillips failed to pay rent on both the April rent due May 1 and the May rent due June 1, 1991. Id. at 225. McLeskey has 
produced no evidence to contradict the Virginia Supreme Court's statement of fact, and this Court will follow the findings of the 
Virginia Supreme Court. In addition, the Supreme Court of Virginia found that Cohn-Phillips had in fact breached the lease by the 
failure to pay rent. Id."
895,36," This evidence includes McLeskey's 50% interest, the amount of money Cohn owed him, the testimony of Ms. Sehring that 
Cohn would take no money from her for a party because of all he owed McLeskey, and Levine's testimony regarding statements 
Cohn made to her. "
897,37," The other company was ITT Real Estate Services. Levine's claim focuses solely on GE Capital; she does not discuss ITT Real 
Estate Services. "
900,*," The Honorable David A. Ezra, United States District Judge for the District of Hawaii, sitting by designation. "
912,1," A first-year player is a player who, in a previous year, attended an NFL training camp but played in fewer than three regular 
season games."
912,2," The other players representing the plaintiff class were James Bishop, John Buddenberg, Gary Couch, Craig Davis, Ricky 
Andrews, Thom Kaumeyer, Wesley Pritchett, and John Simpson. "
913,3," Meanwhile, the NFLMC and the NFLPA finally agreed to a new seven-year collective bargaining agreement on January 6, 
1993. "
915,4," Appellees also rely heavily on the Eighth Circuit's discussion of the nonstatutory labor exemption in Mackey v. NFL, 543 F.2d 
606 (8th Cir. 1976), cert. dismissed, 434 U.S. 801 (1977), which, they contend, ""repeatedly expressed the understanding that the 
Supreme Court decisions precondition the exemption on an agreement."" Brief of Appellees at 29. However, they overlook the 
Eighth Circuit's subsequent statement in Powell, 930 F.2d at 1301, that HN8[
] ""[a] collective bargaining agreement is not 
always essential to a finding that challenged employment terms fall within the labor exemption."" We also note, as did the Powell 
court, id., that other decisions of the courts of appeals have applied the nonstatutory exemption to actions not embodied in 
collective bargaining agreements. See, e.g., Amalgamated Meat Cutters v. Wetterau Foods, Inc., 597 F.2d 133, 136 (8th Cir. 
1979) (holding that employer's agreement with supplier to replace striking workers was protected by nonstatutory labor 
exemption); Prepmore Apparel, Inc. v. Amalgamated Clothing Workers, 431 F.2d 1004, 1006-07 (5th Cir. 1970) (holding that 
employer's refusal to deal with union was exempt from Sherman Act), cert. dismissed, 404 U.S. 801 (1971)."
915,5," In this regard, we note that even one commentator who favors imposing a union consent requirement for application of the 
nonstatutory labor exemption acknowledges that a ""precedent-oriented"" approach to this issue is ""problematic … because in no 
Supreme Court case has union consent been contested."" Note, Releasing Superstars From Peonage: Union Consent and the 
Nonstatutory Labor Exemption, 104 HARV. L. REV. 874, 881-82 (1991) [hereinafter Releasing Superstars]. "
918,6," We also note that each of these alternatives has its own set of problems. In particular, those that require a court to determine 
when it is reasonable to believe a restraint on competition will be incorporated into a future collective bargaining agreement pose 
severe problems of administrability. Further, they are likely to prompt the negotiating parties to distort their positions through 
posturing designed solely to influence this determination."
918,7," The employers' duty to maintain the status quo even after expiration of a collective bargaining agreement fosters the bargaining 
process by protecting the union's position as the representative of the employees on subjects of mandatory bargaining, and by 
maintaining a stable environment for negotiations. See Katz, 369 U.S. at 747; Insurance Agents' Int'l Union, 361 U.S. at 485. We 
cannot fathom how subjecting actions taken pursuant to this duty to the threat of antitrust liability could possibly further the goals 
of the NLRA. Employers faced with such a threat might well hesitate to agree with unions on important terms when they know 
the union may immediately challenge the terms under the antitrust laws once their agreement expires. "
921,8," Counsel acknowledged that the restraint on competition at issue in this case had no impact on the quality of professional 
football competition, and, thus, professional football's ability to compete with other entertainment products. Specifically, counsel 
stated: What we are talking about here are the salaries that were paid to players who didn't even suit up, much less play. For them 
to say that somehow or other the competitive contests were improved and they could compete better with ballet is like a 
bootstrap leap into wonderland. There is just no relationship. Tr. of Oral Argument at 33. As the quoted statement suggests, the clubs and the NFL contend that the fixed salary does impact the market for professional 
football contests, but they argue that it has the entirely procompetitive effect of improving the overall quality of NFL competition. 
Specifically, they assert that the fixed salary provides a disincentive for the most talented rookie and first-year players to agree to 
being ""stashed"" on the Developmental Squads of top NFL teams, and thereby makes such players available to less successful 
teams that need their services immediately. See Brief of Appellants at 8-9, 39-40. Significantly, neither party ever has argued 
that the fixed salary for Developmental Squad players has any anticompetitive impact on the market for the NFL's product--the 
only market involved in this case with which the Sherman Act is concerned. "
923,1," The majority characterizes the players' position as an ill- begotten effort to ""import"" and ""inject"" antitrust principles into collective 
bargaining. Majority opinion (""Maj. op."") at 15, 18. This of course turns the question inside-out. Historically and logically, antitrust 
comes first; the antitrust statutes antedate our labor laws and are of general applicability, applying to labor markets unless some "
924,," statutory or judge-made exemption creates an exception. The question before us then, is whether we should now extend a 
judicially-created exemption from antitrust coverage for collective bargaining agreements into the previously uncharted territory 
of post-collective bargaining imposition of the employers' terms. Thus we might better ask to what extent we must ""import"" and 
""inject"" labor law practices beyond the collective bargaining context into antitrust laws that would otherwise apply."
924,2," Ironically, athletes have sought to achieve employer competition through the same collective bargaining processes that other 
employees use to restrain labor market competition. Players' unions typically bargain for such mobility-enhancing and 
competition-maximizing measures as ""free agency"" and the elimination of reserve clauses, salary caps and player drafts. 
Simultaneously, however, players' unions have embraced more traditional union demands such as league-wide minimum 
salaries and standardized pension plans. See Ethan Lock, The Scope of the Labor Exemption in Professional Sports, 1989 
DUKE L.J. 339, 341 n.12."
924,3," I express no opinion as to whether these labor market restraints actually violate the antitrust laws. In most cases, a rule of 
reason analysis will decide, see Smith v. Pro Football Inc., 193 U.S. App. D.C. 19, 593 F.2d 1173, 1182-83 (D.C. Cir. 1978), 
requiring a fact-specific judgment as to whether the procompetitive benefits, if any, of the labor market restraint outweigh its 
anticompetitive costs. In the present case, appellants colorably argued below that the wage restraint imposed on rookie and first-
year nonroster players was necessary to enhance on-field ""competitive balance"" among teams, thereby making NFL football a 
more attractive and economically competitive entertainment product. Cf.  NCAA v. Board of Regents, 468 U.S. 85, 82 L. Ed. 2d 
70, 104 S. Ct. 2948 (1984). The district court may have erred in ruling such alleged procompetitive benefits ""irrelevant"" and 
granting summary judgment to the players on the question of antitrust liability. Although the majority does not reach the question, 
I would be inclined to remand for further proceedings on the question of antitrust liability under rule of reason analysis. "
926,4," Baseball is an exception for historical reasons. See Flood v. Kuhn, 407 U.S. 258, 32 L. Ed. 2d 728, 92 S. Ct. 2099 (1972). "
928,5," The applicability of antitrust law to unilaterally-imposed terms of employment was not a settled question prior to today's 
decision. But since antitrust coverage presumptively applies to labor markets absent a special exemption, and no exemption 
clearly applied before today, it is fair to say that until now employers at least had to contemplate the risk of antitrust liability if 
they unilaterally imposed industry-wide terms of employment."
928,6," A related concern is that some employers may be emboldened to go beyond hard bargaining and engage in ""surface 
bargaining,"" merely ""going through the motions of negotiating,"" K-Mart Corp. v. NLRB, 626 F.2d 704, 706 (9th Cir. 1980), in 
order to position themselves to unilaterally impose industry-wide labor market restraints when the bargaining fails. Surface 
bargaining is a form of bad-faith bargaining which ""is often difficult to detect,"" Seattle-First Nat. Bank v. NLRB, 638 F.2d 1221, 
1227 n.9 (9th Cir. 1981), because, as we noted in NLRB v. Cauthorne, 223 U.S. App. D.C. 390, 691 F.2d 1023, 1026 n.5 (D.C. 
Cir. 1982), the duty to bargain in good faith does not prohibit an ""employer's adamant insistence on pro-management terms,"" 
and ""neither side is required to agree to a proposal or make concessions."" Thus it will often be difficult to distinguish bad faith 
from mere good-faith ""adamant insistence"" on favorable terms. But whether or not some employers bargain in bad faith, the 
majority's rule clearly shifts the terms of employers' calculations: entering bargaining confident of their ability to circumvent the 
constraints of the antitrust laws either through employees' capitulation or through post-impasse unilateral imposition of terms 
may not be bad faith, but merely a reasonable calculation as to the likely outcome of the negotiation process. "
931,7," Although the question is not directly at issue in this case, I share the majority's view that if the collective bargaining process is 
to work without undue interference from antitrust law, multiemployer ""bargaining tactics"" must fall within the scope of the 
nonstatutory labor exemption. See Maj. op. at 25-26. Although multiemployer bargaining is not expressly authorized by the 
National Labor Relations Act, neither is it prohibited, and the fact that multiemployer bargaining predates the Act strongly 
suggests that it was contemplated as part of the collective bargaining process. NLRB v. Truck Drivers Union Local 449, 353 U.S. 
87, 94-95, 1 L. Ed. 2d 676, 77 S. Ct. 643 (1957) (""Buffalo Linen""); see also Williams, ___ F.3d at ___. Multiemployer bargaining 
strengthens the bargaining process not only by facilitating bargaining on the employers' side, Buffalo Linen, 353 U.S. at 94-95, 
and allowing employers to counter ""whipsaw"" tactics by unions, Charles D. Bonanno Linen Service, Inc. v. NLRB, 454 U.S. 404, 
409-10 & n.3, 70 L. Ed. 2d 656, 102 S. Ct. 720 (1982), but it also makes available joint benefit programs and frees unions from 
the burden of negotiating separately with many small employers. Id. Thus the statutory scheme of the NLRA may well require 
that employers be exempt from antitrust liability for basic bargaining tactics such as joining multiemployer bargaining units; 
developing joint bargaining positions; jointly proposing and negotiating for those positions; and for joint actions, such as lockouts, 
aimed at pressuring the union in hopes of securing an agreement. Cf.  Jewel Tea, 381 U.S. at 713 (Opinion of Goldberg, J.) 
(suggesting multiemployer bargaining must be exempt from antitrust laws); Volkswagenwerk v. Federal Maritime Comm'n, 
390 U.S. 261, 287 n.5, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1090, 88 S. Ct. 929 (1968) (Harlan, J., concurring) (it is ""obvious that the employers are not 
violating the antitrust laws either when they confer about wage policy preparatory to bargaining or when they sign an 
agreement""). See also Goldman, supra, at 674-76 (urging nonstatutory labor exemption for multiemployer bargaining tactics, but 
not for unilaterally-imposed terms). Indeed, there is broad precedent holding multiemployer tactical actions directed at the union 
within a collective bargaining framework exempt from antitrust scrutiny. See, e.g., Amalgamated Meat Cutters & Butchers 
Workmen, Local No. 576 v. Wetterau Foods, Inc., 597 F.2d 133 (8th Cir. 1979) (agreement to supply temporary replacement 
workers to struck employer); Prepmore Apparel, Inc. v. Amalgamated Clothing Workers of Amer., 431 F.2d 1004, 1007 (5th 
Cir. 1970) (alleged conspiracy to refuse to deal with union), cert. dismissed, 404 U.S. 801 (1971); Newspaper Drivers & 
Handlers' Local No. 372 v. NLRB, 404 F.2d 1159 (6th Cir. 1978) (mutual lockout agreement), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 923, 23 L. 
Ed. 2d 240, 89 S. Ct. 1775 (1969); Kennedy v. Long Island R. Co., 319 F.2d 366, 372-73 (2d Cir.) (multiemployer strike 
insurance pact), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 830, 11 L. Ed. 2d 61, 84 S. Ct. 75 (1963). "
932,8," Fort Halifax thus contradicts the majority's contention, Maj. op. at 22, that this case is controlled by dicta in American Ship 
Building, 380 U.S. at 316, naming unilateral imposition of terms among the employers' ""tools of economic self-help."" Even if we 
are bound by the American Ship Building dicta, Fort Halifax--decided later--rejects the implication the majority would draw, that 
any independent statutory limitation on the terms an employer may impose at impasse impermissibly interferes with the 
employer's exercise of self-help tools. "
933,9," In that sense, this case is distinguishable from Williams, where employees mounted an antitrust challenge to employers' 
maintenance of the status quo after expiration of a collective bargaining agreement. There, the employers' labor law duty to 
maintain the status quo squarely conflicted with their alleged antitrust duty not to maintain the status quo. Rather than deciding 
the case on that narrow issue, however, the Williams court announced a broad ouster of antitrust law, similar to the majority's 
here."
933,10," In reaching this conclusion, I do not find it necessary to reach some closely-related questions that have arisen in other cases. 
The most important of these is when, if at all, the nonstatutory labor exemption attaching to a collective bargaining agreement 
ends--at expiration of the collective bargaining agreement, at impasse, or at some other post-impasse point. Since the 
employees never agreed to the labor market restraints at issue here in the first place, no such questions arise in this case. "
942,1," Leave to add Giant as a co-plaintiff with Wharton was granted because Giant had been a participant in the case all along, 
although unnamed. Giant has funded the litigation, according to Wharton's counsel, it has supplied witnesses for depositions, 
and has furnished numerous discovery documents. The formal amendment follows an informal understanding among the parties 
regarding Giant's status and its agreement to be bound by the results of the litigation to the same extent as if it were a party 
allied with Wharton. "
943,2," ""Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue 
therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without 
respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a 
reasonable attorney's fee."" 15 U.S.C. § 15(a)."
943,3," ""Any person, firm, corporation or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of the United 
States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws . . . ."" 15 U.S.C. 
§ 26. "
944,4," Wharton contends that it seeks injunctive relief pursuant to Section 16 of the Clayton Act, and thus, we must use a more liberal 
standard to determine its standing. Wharton's attempt to distinguish the line of standing cases under Section 4, does not work. 
Though the precise standing inquiries are different depending upon whether injunctive relief or treble damages is sought, at 
minimum, the litigant must demonstrate an antitrust injury. See Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 113, 93 L. 
Ed. 2d 427, 107 S. Ct. 484 (1986). "
945,5," Although we dismiss Wharton's antitrust claims, we retain jurisdiction over Wharton's state common law claims pursuant to 28 
U.S.C. § 1367(a). First, Wharton can not satisfy the requirements of 28 U.S.C. § 1332, because, as New Jersey Corporations, 
Wharton and Jarnap are not diverse. However, we may properly exercise supplemental jurisdiction in this case because we 
have original jurisdiction over Giant's antitrust claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1337, and Wharton's claims are so related to Giant's 
claims ""that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States."" 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). We 
further note that interests of judicial economy and fairness to the litigants warrant retention of supplemental jurisdiction over 
Wharton's state law claims. See United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218, 86 S. Ct. 1130 (1966); 
Growth Horizons, Inc. v. Delaware County, 983 F.2d 1277, 1284 (3d Cir. 1993)."
945,6," Because New Jersey's antitrust statutes are construed in harmony with the federal antitrust statutes, we will not separately 
address the validity of those claims here. See 15 N.J.S.A. § 59:9-18; Regency Oldsmobile, Inc. v. General Motors Corp., 723 F. 
Supp. 250, 270 (D.N.J. 1989)."
945,7," The plaintiffs repeatedly cite the Third Circuit decision in Harold Friedman Inc. v. Thorofare Markets Inc., 587 F.2d 127 (3d Cir. 
1978) for the proposition that the validity of antitrust claims cannot be determined on summary judgment. The plaintiffs have 
clearly misinterpreted this decision. Earlier in the opinion the court recognized that ""the Supreme Court has instructed that 'summary procedures should be used 
sparingly in antitrust cases.'"" Id. at 141 (quoting Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 368 U.S. 464, 7 L. Ed. 2d 458, 82 
S. Ct. 486 (1962)). The court then held that ""the unreasonableness of the conduct under attack cannot be determined on a 
motion for summary judgment."" Id. at 142. Plaintiff chops up this latter quote, removes it from its contextual moorings, and 
concludes that the Third Circuit announced an absolute prohibition against summary judgments in Section 1 cases. Plaintiffs' 
interpretation of Harold Friedman overstates the Third Circuit's holding. At most, Harold Friedman emphasizes caution. It does 
not prohibit the award of summary judgment in an appropriate Section 1 case. "
947,8," In fact, Acme's expert stated: ""I cannot identify with precision the outer bounds of the geographic market."" See Declaration of 
William B. Burnett at 29 n.34. "
948,9," Similarly, we also hold that summary judgment is inappropriate on plaintiffs claims under New Jersey Antitrust Act, 15 N.J.S.A. 
§ 56:9-3. "
949,10," We likewise grant summary judgment with respect to plaintiffs' attempted monopolization claims brought pursuant to 15 
N.J.S.A. § 56:9-4."
949,11," The parties do not specifically address whether the covenant interfered with antitrust laws or public policy at the time the 
covenant was created. However, at trial the parties are not precluded from contesting the extent to which the covenant 
restrained trade in 1957, under the restraint of trade, public policy, or changed circumstances factors discussed infra. "
951,12," By this holding we do not express any opinion as to the reasonableness of the scope of the covenant in light of changed 
circumstances. This issue remains for trial in light of our holding that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether 
alternative sites exist for supermarket development."
951,13," The court in Davidson recommended that trial courts borrow analogous authority from cases determining the validity of 
employee noncompetition covenants for use in analyzing the reasonableness of real covenants. Davidson, 121 N.J. at 212, 579 
A.2d at 296."
951,14," Whether conditions have changed to render the covenant unreasonable as to duration is not decided here, but is addressed 
infra in terms of changed circumstances. "
952,15," We cannot reconcile Acme's position with the decision in Davidson. Though the Davidson court cited with approval the case of 
Welitoff v. Kohl, 105 N.J. Eq. 181, 147 A. 390 (1929), the clear focus of the Davidson changed circumstances analysis is not so 
one sided. Welitoff stands for the proposition that the owner of the dominant estate will not be heard in equity for the 
enforcement of a covenant from which he no longer derives benefit. 105 N.J. Eq. at 186-87, 147 A. at 392-93. However, 
Davidson does not indicate that the only covenants which can be found unreasonable because of changed circumstances are 
those from which the dominant estate no longer benefits. Rather, retained benefit to the dominant estate is an important 
consideration in the analysis though not the sole inquiry. "
968,1," The Court notes that defendants' market share in the primary care market in some areas exceeds defendants' market share in 
the HMO services market. However, this issue is resolved by the damages award because plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Beyer, 
calculated Compcare's exclusion damages only in those areas in which defendants had market power for HMOs, smaller areas 
than the primary care markets. "

Antitrust Laws & Trade Regulation § 23.01 (1994). However, Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act are applicable as well. Id. at § 
23.01[1],[2]. This motion, however, is not the proper time or place for delineating the substantive differences that may exist, or 
not, under the different sections. "
1004,1," ""PTO"" refers to the Joint Pre-trial Order. ""B-8"" refers to paragraph 8 of section B, which contains the undisputed facts. "
1006,2," After trial, Cortapasso submitted to the Court copies of various financial documents, presumably in an effort to explain his cash 
flow. Although he did not make a motion to re-open the trial record, we treat it as such and we find that the standard to reopen 
the record has not been met. See, e.g., John v. Sotheby's, Inc., 858 F. Supp. 1283, 1288 (S.D.N.Y. 1994). Even if the standard 
had been met, we find that the submissions do not shed sufficient light on Cortapasso's unexplained cash flow to warrant a 
different result in this case. They establish, at most, that $ 6,000 was withdrawn in July 1986 from a custodial account for benefit 
of Cortapasso's daughter and that the Cortapassos received $ 25,371 from a refinancing in September 1983. "
1007,3," This is the date of the first substantial, unexplained cash deposit to Cortapasso's account."
1007,4, The invoices and other documents by which Capolino sought payment and the Bureau's checks typically were mailed. 
1008,5," The common law fraud claim requires proof by clear and convincing evidence, see Simcuski v. Saeli, 44 N.Y.2d 442, 452, 406 
N.Y.S.2d 259, 265, 377 N.E.2d 713 (1978), rather than the preponderance necessary on all other claims, and has a restricted 
measure of damages in that only out-of-pocket losses are recoverable under New York law, see Reno v. Bull, 226 N.Y. 546, 
553, 124 N.E. 144 (1919). The claim for commercial bribery raises the issue whether violation of N.Y. Penal L. § 180.05 
(McKinney 1988), gives rise to a private cause of action, which the Superintendent has not briefed apart from citing Shemin v. 
A. Black & Co., 19 A.D.2d 596, 240 N.Y.S.2d 622 (1st Dep't 1963). Shemin assumes the point at issue and predates such 
cases as CPC Int'l, Inc. v. McKesson Corp., 70 N.Y.2d 268, 519 N.Y.S.2d 804, 514 N.E.2d 116 (1987), which cast doubt on its 
vitality. As there are no elements of damage available on these claims that are not recoverable on the RICO or breach of 
fiduciary duty claims, we see no need to address them. "
1010,6," As noted below, the Superintendent claims that Cortapasso was at least as responsible for this procurement as DePrima. "
1012,7," We recognize that this statute does not apply to Cortapasso, who was not employed by any of the sorts of political entities 
referred to in the statute. "
1030,1," Patel argues that the personal nature of the individual Defendants' motives is ""wholly irrelevant"" to their ability to participate in a 
conspiracy, citing Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145, 88 S. Ct. 869, 19 L. Ed. 2d 998 (1968). While this may be true, it is 
equally true that the nature of the motivation is wholly relevant to the application of the personal stake exception. Albrecht 
supports both propositions. In Albrecht, the United States Supreme Court found that a conspiracy in violation of § 1 could exist 
between a newspaper publisher, an independent newspaper distributor, and a separate company retained by the publisher for 
the purpose of diverting the plaintiff's customers to the distributor. The Albrecht court held that a conspiracy could exist even 
though one of the defendants received no benefit from the conspiracy and acted only because of coercion. Id. at 149-50, 88 S. 
Ct. at 871-72. However, each of the three defendants was a separate company, and, therefore, Albrecht is not relevant to the 
present discussion of the personal stake exception. In the case at bar, it is Patel's burden to allege that the individual 
Defendants were motivated economically to participate in the alleged conspiracy, and she has chosen to allege that they were 
motivated solely by personal concerns. Albrecht in no way controls application of the personal stake exception to the 
circumstances at bar. "
1032,2," The court also notes that Patel has failed to allege the markets affected by the alleged conspiracy. Where an anesthesiologist 
is prohibited from practicing in a certain hospital, the relevant markets affected are (1) the consumers of anesthesiology 
services, and (2) the providers of anesthesiology services. Balaklaw, 14 F.3d at 793. Patel's Amended Complaint contains no 
allegations regarding the effect of her being prohibited from using CRNAs on these markets."
1032,3," Patel argues that Summit Health, Ltd. v. Pinhas, 500 U.S. 322, 111 S. Ct. 1842, 114 L. Ed. 2d 366 (1991), supports the position 
that exclusion of one practitioner from a hospital is sufficient to allege anticompetitive effect. Pinhas, however, holds only that the 
jurisdictional requirement of showing that the agreement at issue affects interstate commerce is met by alleging that a hospital, 
its owners, and its staff conspired to exclude the plaintiff doctor from practicing at the hospital.  Id., 111 S. Ct. at 1848-49. In fact, 
the lower court in Pinhas found that the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged antitrust injury because the complaint alleged that the 
plaintiff provided services at a lower price than his competitors by performing operations at a faster rate than that of his 
competitors. Pinhas v. Summit Health, Ltd., 894 F.2d 1024, 1032 (9th Cir. 1989), aff'd, 500 U.S. 322, 111 S. Ct. 1842, 114 L. Ed. 
2d 366 (1991). In the case at bar, Patel has made no allegations regarding the effect of her preclusion from using SMH's CRNAs 
on the price of anesthesiology services offered at the hospital or on competition among anesthesiology service providers."
1032,4," Patel argues that Defendants have failed to set forth any pro-competitive justifications for their actions. However, this argument 
is without merit because such justifications are required only where the plaintiff has carried its own initial burden under the rule of 
reason of showing a restraint on competition.  Capital Imaging, 996 F.2d at 547. Patel has failed to make any allegations which 
could support a finding that Defendants' actions were anticompetitive in the sense of harming ""the competitive process"" rather 
than merely harming any one competitor. See Interface Group, 816 F.2d at 10. Patel's allegations have focused solely on the 
effect of Defendants' actions on her. "
1042,1," CBVT was formed by two general partners, Cetus Generic Corporation (""CGC"") and Ben Venue Generic Corporation 
(""BVGC""). CGC, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in California, was a subsidiary of Cetus Corporation, 
which also was a Delaware corporation based in California. BVGC, an Ohio corporation, is a subsidiary of Ben Venue 
Laboratories, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation with its principal place of business in Ohio. In 1992, Cetus Corporation changed 
its name to Cetus Oncology Corporation following its acquisition by merger with Chiron Corporation. CGC remains a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Cetus Oncology Corporation. "
1043,2," Although Sicor alleges that the two parties also orally agreed that CBVT would pursue its antitrust and unfair competition claims 
against the Farmitalia Group in consideration for Alco's payment of one-half of the associated litigation costs, the parties dispute 
the existence and enforceability of any such agreement. See infra."
1043,3," Not to be confused with Alco and CBVT's Second Amendment, also of that date. See supra. "
1044,4, The parties dispute whether these negotiations gave rise to a contract. See infra.
1044,5," ""CBVT"" is here meant to include the Cetus Corporation, Cetus Generic Corporation, Ben Venue Laboratories, Inc., and Ben 
Venue Generic Corporation, as well as Cetus-Ben Venue Therapeutics. See note 1, supra."
1044,6," While summary judgment has historically been disfavored in antitrust cases, see High Tech. Careers v. San Jose Mercury 
News, 996 F.2d 987, 989 (9th Cir. 1993) (citing Christofferson Dairy, Inc. v. MMM Sales, Inc., 849 F.2d 1168, 1171 (9th Cir. 
1988)), this may no longer be so. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 588, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, 
106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986); Bhan v. NME Hosps., Inc., 929 F.2d 1404, 1409 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 994, 116 L. Ed. 2d 
639, 112 S. Ct. 617 (1991). Regardless of whether or not summary judgment is still disfavored in antitrust cases, we conclude 
for the reasons set forth in Part I.B. that summary judgment was appropriate on the appellants' antitrust claims. "
1045,7," The appellants' initial contention is that the district court failed to distinguish properly between ""specific facts"" and ""substantial 
evidence,"" and thereby applied an incorrect legal standard for summary judgment in an antitrust case. See T.W. Elec. Serv. v. 
Pacific Elec. Contrs. Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 632 (9th Cir. 1987). Because the district court's grant of summary judgment was 
premised on its holding that there was no proof of any injury to competition, any error - if such it was - involving a confusion of 
""substantial evidence"" with ""specific facts"" was clearly harmless. "
1046,8," While it is true as a general proposition that the existence of valid business reasons motivating a monopolist's conduct is 
ordinarily a question of fact, see High Tech. Careers v. San Jose Mercury News, 996 F.2d 987, 990 (9th Cir. 1993), the absence 
of evidence to the contrary in the instant case is dispositive of this issue. See also Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 588 (""conduct as 
consistent with permissible competition as with illegal conspiracy does not, standing alone, support an inference of antitrust 
conspiracy"")."
1046,9," Sicor's allegation that no other finisher-distributor would have been readily available to contract with Sicor or other potential 
foreign entrants into the American market at the supply level is arguably beside the point, for elimination of Sicor as a competitor 
would still leave the market essentially where it was before Sicor's entry, viz., with two producers and three finisher-distributors."
1046,10," Because of our holding on this point, we need not reach the merits of the appellants' contention that the district court erred by 
ruling that Sicor, as a mere middleman, lacked standing to assert a claim under federal antitrust law. But see Hanover Shoe, 
Inc. v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 488-89, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231, 88 S. Ct. 2224 (1968) (rejecting defense in Clayton 
Act case that middleman, in being able to pass overcharge on to consumers, was not truly injured and thus lacked antitrust 
standing); Yellow Pages Cost Consultants, Inc. v. GTE Directories Corp., 951 F.2d 1158, 1161 (9th Cir. 1991) (reversing denial "
1047,," of standing to advertising consultants earning commissions by serving as intermediary between advertisers and publishers), 
cert. denied, 504 U.S. 913, 112 S. Ct. 1947, 118 L. Ed. 2d 552 (1992). With this said, however, we note that the district court did 
not base its holding on this conclusion, ruling instead that ""the Court need not decide this issue because the Court GRANTS 
Erbamont's motion for partial summary judgment on the basis that there has been no proof of injury to competition."""
1047,11," A Section 2 claim of attempted monopolization, on the other hand, requires proof of four elements: ""(1) specific intent to 
control prices or destroy competition; (2) predatory or anti-competitive conduct directed toward accomplishing that purpose; (3) a 
dangerous probability of success; and (4) causal antitrust injury."" McGlinchy v. Shell Chem. Co., 845 F.2d 802, 811 (9th Cir. 
1988). As there was no showing of attempted monopolization on the part of the appellees, we will not further discuss this aspect 
of Section 2."
1047,12, It is undisputed that California law governs the parties' claims. 
1048,13," We recognize, as did the district court, that section 5(a)(ii) of the Second Supply Agreement warrants in plain language that all 
compound sold under the agreement shall be ""manufactured by Sicor S.p.A. in accordance with applicable manufacturing 
practice requirements."" Further, we agree with the district court's conclusion that the warranty provisions in section 5(c) do not 
clearly support Sicor's interpretation of the contract. In that section Sicor warrants that ""any COMPOUND which comes into its 
possession or control prior to delivery to CBVT shall not become in violation of the warranties and representations made in (a) 
and (b) at any time prior to the COMPOUND leaving its possession and control."" The district court reasonably concluded that 
section 5(c) is inapplicable to shortfalls of the sort at issue here involving the quantity, as opposed to quality, of Sicor's deliveries. While section 5(c) can be read to apply where a nonconforming shipment triggers Sicor's obligation under section 6(c) to use its 
best efforts to secure ""Compound manufactured by an alternative manufacturer,"" sections 5(c) and 6(c) do not preclude Sicor 
from selling doxorubicin manufactured by a third party in other events, including production halts or shortfalls of the sort at issue 
here. "
1049,14," Prior to this letter, the only communication from CBVT arguably resembling a notice of termination was a letter dated 
December 6, 1990, from Cetus Corporation to Alco, stating that ""we will continue, independently of your efforts, to seek and 
qualify alternative sources of bulk."" Under California law, ""while a notice of termination or cancellation of a contract for breach 
need not be formal and explicit, it should clearly indicate to the defaulting party that the injured party considers the contract 
terminated."" Whitney Invest. Co. v. Westview Dev. Co., 78 Cal. Rptr. 302, 308, 273 Cal. App. 2d 594, 603 (1969). The 
December 6, 1990 letter did not indicate with the requisite degree of clarity that CBVT intended to terminate the Second Supply 
Agreement."
1049,15," Section 2711 provides in relevant part that, ""Where the seller fails to make delivery . . . the buyer may cancel,"" in addition to 
recovering damages for nondelivery and seeking specific performance or replevy. Cal. Com. Code § 2711(1)(b), (2)(b)."
1049,16," A similar triable issue arises as to whether the parties settled on a ""course of action"" pursuant to section 7 by virtue of 
negotiations held between Mercian and Sicor in 1990 and 1991 with the knowledge, if not participation, of CBVT; a 
memorandum, dated February 22, 1991, circulated between the parties regarding various ""marketing scenarios"" and launch 
dates for CBVT's finishing and sale of Mercian-manufactured doxorubicin; and contemporaneous assurances from CBVT that 
Mercian would be an acceptable alternate manufacturer. Sicor contends that ""not only did Cetus representatives participate in these discussions [with Mercian], they agreed in principle to 
an arrangement under which Sicor would supply a minimum of 18 kgs of Mercian-manufactured doxorubicin over a three year 
period."" This contention was disputed in the pleadings but was sufficiently founded on declarations submitted by Sicor. 
Accordingly, a material and unresolved issue persists regarding whether Sicor and CBVT met one month or more after the force 
majeure arose in accordance with sections 7 and 8(c) and, within two months thereof, settled upon a course of action from which 
CBVT unilaterally deviated in breach of section 8(c). "
1052,17," Sicor's failure to carry its burden of coming forth with some evidence to support its claim under Count 6 was not the basis for 
the district court's grant of summary judgment. Nevertheless, we may affirm a summary judgment on any ground finding support 
in the record, whether or not relied upon by the trial court.  Jewel Cos. v. Pay Less Drug Stores N.W., Inc., 741 F.2d 1555, 1564-
65 (9th Cir. 1984). "
1070,*," Local Rule 47.5 provides ""The publication of opinions that have no precedential value and merely decide particular cases on

referred to herein as ""Uniforce"") named as defendants only NCCI, the predecessor unincorporated business entity, the Pool, and 
""John Does (1), (2) and (3)."" After the pending motion had been fully briefed, Uniforce served a First Amended Complaint, 
substituting Liberty, Travelers, and INA for the ""John Doe"" defendants. Liberty, Travelers and INA have joined in the motion for 
summary judgment, and the parties have stipulated that the motion may be deemed addressed to the First Amended Complaint."

1078,5," Plaintiffs urge in their opposing memorandum (""Pl. Mem."" at p. 7) that summary judgment should not be granted at this time 
because they have not had ""adequate time for discovery."" Because the instant motion is addressed solely to the legal sufficiency 
of Uniforce's claims, and because ""plaintiffs identify no other possibly discoverable fact that would be material to the legal issues 
before us,"" this contention is without merit. Sandy River Nursing Care v. Aetna Casualty, 985 F.2d 1138, 1141 (1st Cir.), cert.

states which relate to the regulation or taxation of such business. Sec. 2(b) No Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the 
purpose of regulating the business of insurance, or which imposes a fee or tax upon such business, unless such Act specifically 
relates to the business of insurance: Provided, That after June 30, 1948, the Act of July 2, 1890, as amended, known as the 
Sherman Act, and the Act of October 15, 1914, as amended, known as the Clayton Act, and the Act of September 26, 1914, 
known as the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, shall be applicable to the business of insurance to the extent that 
such business is not regulated by State law. Sec. 3(b) Nothing contained in this Chapter shall render the said Sherman Act inapplicable to any agreement to boycott, coerce, 
or intimidate, or act of boycott, coercion, or intimidation."

1080,7," F.T.C. v. Ticor Ins. Co., 504 U.S. 621, 112 S. Ct. 2169, 2171, 119 L. Ed. 2d 410 (1992), cited by Uniforce on the subject of 
McCarran-Ferguson state regulation, actually involved an entirely different issue, the ""active supervision"" prong of the state 
action doctrine first enunciated in Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 87 L. Ed. 315, 63 S. Ct. 307 (1943). Even as to state action, it 
is doubtful whether Uniforce's allegations as to the supposedly poor quality of the state regulation would be sufficient as a matter 
of law. See Ticor,  112 S. Ct. at 2177 (purpose of active supervision inquiry under the state action doctrine ""is not to determine 
whether the State has met some normative standard, such as efficiency, in its regulatory practices""). Indeed, plaintiffs 
acknowledge (Pl. Mem. at p. 4) that in an earlier antitrust action NCCI obtained summary judgment on state action grounds.  
Gulf Marine Repair Corp. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1685 (M.D. Fla. 1994), aff'd., 46 F.3d 70 (11th Cir. 
1995). However, since the instant motion is not based on the state action doctrine, it is unnecessary to resolve this issue."
1080,8," Indeed, plaintiffs conceded during oral argument that each respective state regulator would have the authority to address each 
of these practices had plaintiffs first raised their concerns in that forum rather than in this Court. "
1081,9," Once it is determined that the allegations of the complaint do not amount to a ""boycott"" within the meaning of McCarran-
Ferguson, it follows that the same alleged actions ""do not constitute 'coercion' or 'intimidation' within the meaning of the statute."" 
Hartford, 113 S. Ct. at 2915, n.6. "
1082,10," As has been recognized by the Eleventh Circuit, the filed rate doctrine is applicable in cases concerning state rates as well as 
is in those concerning federal rates. See Taffet v. Southern Co., 967 F.2d 1483, 1494 (11th Cir.)(en banc), cert. denied sub. 
nom. 113 S. Ct. 657 (1992) (the rationale underlying the filed rate doctrine applies ""whether the rate at issue has been set by a 
state rate-making authority or a federal one"")."
1082,11," Plaintiffs imply that the filed rate doctrine is inapplicable if the unlawful activity of the defendants is not presented to the 
regulator setting the rates. It is well-settled, however, that there is no fraud exception to the filed rate doctrine. See Taffet, 967 
F.2d at 1494-95. Moreover, the cases relied upon by plaintiffs are inapposite. Brown v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 982 F.2d 386, 394 
(9th Cir. 1992), involved a unique situation in which the state did not ""meaningfully review"" the rates in question; plaintiffs do not 
suggest that such is the case for any of the subject states here. City of Kirkwood v. Union Elec. Co., 671 F.2d 1173 (8th Cir. 
1982), cert. denied sub. nom., 459 U.S. 1170 (1982) concerned defendant's alleged anticompetitive combination of rates and 
thus did not present the same type of direct challenge to the level of rates raised by plaintiffs in the instant action. "
1083,12," Uniforce also states (Compl. P 69) that it has suffered discrimination with respect to its insurance premiums ""contrary to 15 
U.S.C. § 13 [Section 2 of the Clayton Act; Section 1 of the Robinson-Patman Act] if such act applied to services, and not just 
commodities,"" but apparently does not seek to assert a claim under that statute. In any event, the Robinson-Patman Act is 
limited by its express terms to ""commodities,"" and has consistently been held not to apply to services or other intangibles. See, 
e.g., Ball Memorial Hosp., Inc. v. Mutual Hosp. Ins., Inc., 784 F.2d 1325, 1340 (7th Cir.), reh'g denied, 788 F.2d 1223 (7th Cir. 
1986); TV Signal Co. v. AT&T, 462 F.2d 1256 (8th Cir. 1972). Insurance services have specifically been held not to constitute 
""commodities"" under the Act. Freeman v. Chicago Title & Trust Co., 505 F.2d 527 (7th Cir. 1974). "
1084,13," The present discussion assumes, without deciding, the truth of Uniforce's assertion (Compl. P 82) that defendants were ""state 
actors"" and that their alleged actions were performed under color of state law. Otherwise, of course, no Constitutional issue 
would be presented, since the Fourteenth Amendment has no application to the actions of private parties. Rendell-Baker v. 
Kohn, 457 U.S. 830, 837-38, 73 L. Ed. 2d 418, 102 S. Ct. 2764 (1982). "

1109,2," In Kaiser Aluminum the Court found that a counterclaim alleging an illegal tying arrangement was barred by the statute of 
limitations. The contract made the basis of the counterclaim was signed more than four years prior to the claim being alleged. 
The Court found that, because damages, although not definite in amount, were not speculative or unprovable at the time the 
contract was signed, summary judgment was appropriate."
1109,3," Revival occurs when the damages are speculative or unprovable at the time of the antitrust violation. Kaiser, 677 F.2d at 1052. "
1127,1," Marginal cost is the cost that a firm incurs in the production of one additional unit of output. Herbert Hovenkamp, Economics 
and Federal Antitrust Law 10 (1985). Rebel measured ARCO's marginal cost based upon an agreement that ARCO signed with 
Tosco Corp. to purchase incremental supplies of gasoline. Rebel claims that ARCO bought the additional supplies of gasoline 
from Tosco because it was expanding output but was unable to obtain the additional output from its own refineries. The cost of 
this ""last barrel"" of gasoline represents ARCO's marginal cost for gasoline. "
1129,2," Sherman Act § 2 states: HN4[
] ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any person or persons, to monopolize . . . trade shall be guilty"" of an antitrust violation.  15 U.S.C. § 2 (1994)."
1129,3," ""Losses during a price war will be proportionally higher for the predator because he faces the necessity of expanding his output 
at ever higher costs, while the victim not only will not expand output but has the option of reducing it and so decreasing his 
costs."" Robert H. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 148 (1979). "
1130,4," Social welfare is maximized when the price of a good equals its marginal cost - the cost of producing the last unit of output. 
When a firm with market power cuts output to increase prices, price exceeds marginal cost. This causes a loss to society of all 
that additional output which the firm could produce by lowering its price to marginal cost.  Janich Bros., Inc. v. American Distilling 
Co., 570 F.2d 848, 857 n.9 (9th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 829, 58 L. Ed. 2d 122, 99 S. Ct. 103 (1978). "
1131,5," The price-correlation data purportedly showed that the prices of self-serve, cash-only gasoline and full-serve gasoline tend to 
move together, i.e., when one goes up, the other goes up, and vice versa. The expert noted that under the ""Stigler"" method of 
proving supply elasticity, high price correlation indicates that consumers view the products as substitutes for each other. See 
George J. Stigler & Robert A. Sherwin, The Extent of the Market, 28 J.L. & Econ. 555, 572-73 (1985). Self-serve sellers could 
not increase price and still expect to serve the same number of customers (and, hence, sell the same quantity of gasoline) as 
they did at the lower price. "
1132,6," If we accepted Rebel's argument, we would be assuming the existence of ARCO's market power before defining the relevant 
market, a method of analysis that defies logic. Moreover, the purpose of defining the relevant market in an attempt-to-
monopolize claim is to determine whether ARCO has sufficient market power to pose a threat of monopoly. The fact that the 
market is an oligopoly is of no concern, as an oligopoly is not per se illegal under Sherman Act § 2. See Indiana Grocery, Inc. v. 
Super Valu Stores, Inc., 864 F.2d 1409, 1415-16 (7th Cir. 1989). "
1133,7," As proof of conspiracy, Rebel submitted an article in a trade publication in which Ed Herbst, vice president of the family-owned 
business, was quoted as saying: ""ARCO opened stores in Las Vegas and was selling 5 to 7 cents a gallon below what we paid 
wholesale. My dad said, 'If you can't beat them, join them.' So we joined them."""
1133,8," To prove a conspiracy to monopolize, Rebel must show that the independent dealers had the specific intent to conspire to 
monopolize; it is not enough to show that the dealers merely agreed to go along with ARCO's pricing. See Belfiore v. New York 
Times Co., 826 F.2d 177, 183 (2d Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1067, 98 L. Ed. 2d 994, 108 S. Ct. 1030 (1988)."
1133,9," While the issue of collusion is a matter disputed by ARCO, the district court limited discovery strictly to the issue of market 
power. No discovery was allowed on collusion. Given that fact, all inferences on the issue of collusion must be drawn in Rebel's 
favor to properly determine the summary judgment motion. See Fludd v. United States Secret Serv., 771 F.2d 549, 554 (D.C. 
Cir. 1985) (per curiam). "
1134,10," The Fourth Circuit has stated that claims involving shares between 30 and 50 percent ""should usually be rejected, except 
when conduct is very likely to achieve monopoly or when conduct is invidious, but not so much so as to make the defendant per 
se liable."" M & M Medical Supplies, 981 F.2d at 168 (citing Areeda & Turner Par. 835c, at 350). This standard, initially proposed 
by Professors Areeda and Turner, would include predatory conduct in the ""invidious"" category. In addition, a separate standard 
would presume market power if the market share is greater than 50 percent, if the other substantive elements of an attempt to 
monopolize claim are satisfied.  Id. at 168. We are reluctant to apply such bright-line rules regarding market share in deciding whether a defendant has market power to 
restrict output or raise prices. Courts should be ""wary of the numbers game of market percentage"" when considering attempt-to-
monopolize claims.  Dimmitt Agri Industries, 679 F.2d at 533. As Professors Areeda and Turner admit, their refined rules may be 
""illusory"" guides to deciding market power. Areeda & Turner Par. 835c, at 350. The far wiser approach, which this circuit has 
observed if not explicitly adopted, is illustrated by Ball Memorial Hosp., 784 F.2d at 1335 (7th Cir.) and Ryko Mfg., 823 F.2d at 
1232 (8th Cir.), where HN22[
] the issue of market power was decided by carefully analyzing certain telltale factors in the 
relevant market: market share, entry barriers and the capacity of existing competitors to expand output. We see no reason to 
depart from this mode of analysis."
1134,11," ""It is well known that some of the most insuperable barriers in the great race of competition are the result of government 
regulation."" United States v. Syufy Enterprises, 903 F.2d 659, 673 (9th Cir. 1990). "
1135,12," A refiner is barred if it meets three conditions: (1) produced more than 30 percent of the domestic and imported crude oil 
supplied to its refinery; (2) refines gasoline from crude oil; and (3) has a total refinery capacity of more than 175,000. 15 Nev. 
Rev. Stat. § 598.677. "
1136,13," According to Rebel's own expert, these marketers included Domino's, Desert Bait, Green Valley, King 8 and Express. "
1139,14," Section 1 states: HN35[
] ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce . . . is declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1 (1994)."
1139,15," To put it another way, pricing below marginal cost is socially wasteful because the seller produces goods at a cost which is 
greater than their value to consumers. Janich Bros., 570 F.2d at 857-58; Hovenkamp, Economics and Federal Antitrust Law, at 
46. As we have noted previously, allocative efficiency is synonymous with consumer welfare, Chesapeake and Ohio R.R. Co. v. 
United States, 704 F.2d 373, 376 (7th Cir. 1983), and is the central goal of the Sherman Act. Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. United 
States, 356 U.S. 1, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545, 78 S. Ct. 514 (1958) (the Sherman Act ""rests on the premise that the unrestrained 
interaction of competitive forces will yield the best allocation of our economic resources."") "
1140,16," The Supreme Court implicitly overruled Utah Pie Co. v. Continental Baking Co., 386 U.S. 685, 18 L. Ed. 2d 406, 87 S. Ct. 
1326 (1967), a controversial case which set forth different standards for primary-line injury. The court explained that Utah Pie 
was merely an ""early judicial inquiry."" Brooke Group, 113 S. Ct. at 2587. "
1141,17," The Robinson-Patman Act ""attaches to competitive relations between a given seller and his several customers. It concerns 
discrimination between customers of the same seller. It has nothing to do with . . . requiring the maintenance of any relationship 
in prices charged by a competing seller."" H.R. Report No. 2287, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1936)."
1141,18," Enacted in 1936, the Robinson-Patman Act amendments were an outgrowth of dissatisfaction with the original Clayton Act's 
inability to prevent large retail chains from obtaining ""quantity discounts"" from big suppliers, at the disadvantage of small retailers 
who competed with the chains. H.R. Report No. 2287, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. 3-4 (1936); S. Rep. No. 1502, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. 
4 (1936); FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. 37, 43, 92 L. Ed. 1196, 68 S. Ct. 822 (1948). The new law broadened the scope of the Clayton Act's provisions. While the Clayton Act only proscribed conduct that may 
""substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly[,]"" the new law added the following crucial passage: ""or to injure, 
destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or 
with customers of either of them."" The purpose of this passage was to relieve secondary-line plaintiffs - small retailers who are 
disfavored by discriminating suppliers - from having to prove harm to competition marketwide, allowing them instead to impose 
liability simply by proving effects to individual competitors. H.R. Report No. 2287, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1936). As the House 
Report stated: The existing law has in practice been too restrictive in requiring a showing of general injury to competitive conditions in the line 
of commerce concerned, whereas the more immediately important concern is in injury to the competitor victimized by the 
discrimination. The Senate Report stated that the amendments aimed to prevent competitor injury as a means of preventing general market 
injury - ""to catch the weed in the seed will keep it from coming to flower."" S. Rep. No. 1502, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. 4 (1936). As 
the Supreme Court long ago stated: ""Congress intended to protect a merchant from competitive injury attributable to 
discriminatory prices . . ."" Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. at 49; Greater Rockford Energy, 998 F.2d at 399-400 n.11. "
1143,19," ARCO argues that Rebel's continued presence in the Las Vegas Market undercuts Rebel's claim of antitrust injury. ARCO 
contends that, while oligopoly pricing hurts consumer welfare, Rebel, as a competitor in the market, stood to benefit from any 
oligopoly pricing. See Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 574. It is undisputed that during the peak of the alleged oligopoly pricing, when the 
cost of a gallon of gasoline was more than 19 cents higher in Las Vegas than in Los Angeles, Rebel's prices were within a penny 
of ARCO's prices. Rebel may have received gains during this period offsetting some of the lost profits it suffered during the 
period of ARCO's alleged below-cost pricing. Even if this is true, however, the argument goes to the measure of damages, rather 
than the existence of antitrust injury. If Rebel is ultimately able to prove injury resulting from anticompetitive conduct on the part 
of ARCO, it should not be precluded from recovery simply because it was not driven completely from the market."
1143,20," We, of course, express no opinion on the ultimate merits of the claim. At trial, Rebel may fail to establish a ""reasonable 
prospect"" of recoupment by ARCO, or ARCO may be able to prove facts sufficient to establish a defense to Rebel's claim. "
1148,1," By his Counterclaims, Chess asserts that Harcourt breached its contractual obligations to him by failing to provide him with 
severance pay and with a bonus for courses sold to students for the 1995-1977 bar review courses, that Harcourt constructively 
discharged him, that Harcourt has libeled him, and that Harcourt has wrongfully interfered with his prospective business 
advantage with West. "
1149,2," Both Chess and Levine have represented to the Court that Conviser and they had repeatedly examined the possibility of 
creating their own bar review business since 1978 and, most recently, in 1994. Conviser has not contested this representation, 
nor has he denied knowledge of a prior interest on the part of Chess, Levine and others, to leave Harcourt if they were 
unsuccessful in securing favorable employment terms at Harcourt. Rather, Conviser has attested to the following: West's effort to question the New York Action on the ground that [Harcourt] either knew or should have known of the 
possibility that Chess and Levine would leave to form a competing business is fanciful. To the contrary, Chess and Levine 
continued to hold themselves out as loyal and faithful employees, officers and directors of the Company until the day they 
resigned, and they gave me the impression that they supported all aspects of the Company's business. * * * Chess and 
Levine led me to believe that these discussions [toward their successor employment agreements] were in good faith, an 
impression that was false. Moreover, even if Chess and Levine had been unhappy with the status of these negotiations, 
nothing they did or said in any way suggested to me that they would engage in misconduct of the scope and severity 
described herein and alleged in the New York Action. Notably, Chess and Levine have not contradicted Conviser's disavowal of any knowledge or notice of their actions in January of 
1995, nor have they explained their need to ""shroud their efforts in secrecy"" -- as Conviser has expressed it -- other than to 
indicate that such stealth was a requisite for any continued negotiations with West."
1149,3," Technically, as related in their Affidavits to the Court, Fine and Cohen are identified as Vice Presidents of ""Bar/Bri,"" which is the 
trade name under which Harcourt's bar examination review courses are marketed. Since, undeniably, Fine, Cohen and Rubin 
are ""key"" employees in the marketing of Harcourt's bar review materials, we conveniently refer to them as Vice Presidents of 
Harcourt, even though the offices they have held may have been with a subdivision of Harcourt. "
1150,4," The Record before us also contains the conflicting averments of Levine and Michael Sims, who is Harcourt's Southeast 
Regional Director. On the one hand, Levine has related that Sims pursued him with a request to be involved in any planned 
departure from Harcourt and that, consistent with Sims' expressed interest, Levine had kept him advised of West's developing 
involvement in the formation of a competitor to Harcourt. Although Levine has denied any effort on his part to pressure Sims into 
leaving Harcourt, Sims has averred to the following: In a further effort to cause me to resign from the Company, Levine assured me that the entire executive staff of the New 
York office would be leaving to join the new venture. He further indicated that he was contacting numerous Company 
employees, faculty and instructors throughout the Company's business, and soliciting their resignations to assure their 
participation in the new venture as well. Both agree that Sims met with Levine at Levine's residence in Washington, D.C., and that a letter of resignation was prepared by 
Sims on a computer that was located in the home of one of Levine's neighbors. According to Sims, however, ""on Sunday, 
January 22, Levine took me to his neighbor's house and stood by while I typed a letter of resignation on the neighbor's 
computer."" In turn, Levine has countered that ""Sims expressed his own desire to leave Harcourt, and, on Sunday afternoon, 
Sims used my neighbor's computer to draft his letter of resignation from Harcourt, printing three copies and signing each one."" 
Both agree that Sims did not resign from Harcourt."
1150,5," Harcourt pinpoints and underscores an exhibit, that was filed with the Court, and that purports to be an advertisement that 
Chess had posted at Syracuse Law School on January 24, 1994 -- one day after his resignation from Harcourt. The 
advertisement advises of two job openings at ""West Bar Review, a subsidiary of the West Publishing Company,"" and lists the 
contact individual as: ""Stanley D. Chess, President, West Bar Review."" According to the same advertisement, ""West Bar Review 
will run its first New York course for the July 1996 bar exam."" We are able to draw little of substance from this advertisement for the exhibit is not self-authenticating and is, in all essential 
respects, rank hearsay. We ascribe to the view that Motions for Summary Judgment are not well-served by materials which are "
1151,," inadmissible at trial and, in view of the countering hearsay evidence that has been proffered by the Plaintiffs, the substantive 
showings of both parties have been adversely affected by their advancement of evidence which, in part, is patently incompetent. 
Financial Timing Publications v. Compugraphic Corp., 893 F.2d 936, 942 (8th Cir. 1990). "
1152,6," Apart from the purportedly ""sham"" Complaint that Harcourt filed in the New York Courts, in its fullest explication of Harcourt's 
other purportedly anticompetitive conduct, WestPEG has asserted the following in its original Complaint: On information and belief, Harcourt's actions are in furtherance of a concerted plan and pattern of behavior by Harcourt to 
engage in predatory conduct against competitors and potential competitors in order to discourage entry into the national 
and state bar review course markets by competitors and thereby cause injury to competition in those markets. The 
predatory plan includes the actions which have been the subject of previous antitrust cases brought against Harcourt by its 
competitors. No other conduct by Harcourt, which purportedly has violated any of the antitrust laws of the Federal Government or of the State 
of Minnesota, was alleged in WestPEG's initial Complaint. "
1153,7," At the time of the Hearing, the Court questioned the propriety of WestPEG's attempt to amend its initial Complaint through the 
submission of Affidavits. Apparently, counsel for WestPEG were of the view that Harcourt's Motion to Dismiss was a ""responsive 
pleading,"" as that terminology is employed by Rule 15(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and that, therefore, leave to amend 
WestPEG's Complaint would be required. Of course, such a construction of Rule 15(a) is wholly without merit. See, generally, 6 
Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d § 1483 at pages 544-86 (1990), and cases cited therein. 
Notably, up to that point in its argument, WestPEG's counsel had been characterizing its initial Complaint as having been 
""carefully crafted."" In contrast, during its argument, Harcourt encouraged the Court to reject any inclination to allow WestPEG an 
opportunity to amend its Complaint, citing the futility of such an exercise. See, Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 9 L. Ed. 2d 
222, 83 S. Ct. 227 (1962); see also, Thompson-El v. Jones, 876 F.2d 66, 67 (8th Cir. 1989). Of course, Harcourt's entreaty has 
now been mooted and, following WestPEG's filing of an Amended Complaint, Harcourt has urged a dismissal, pursuant to Rule 
12(b)(6), for reasons which are identical to those which had undergirded its earlier futility argument. "
1154,8," Acknowledging that it has no authority for the proposition, WestPEG would have us infer that Conviser's knowledge of -- or, for 
that matter, his past involvement in -- a conceptual scheme by Chess and Levine to compete against Harcourt, at some future 
date, should deprive Harcourt of any claim it might have against Chess and Levine, as their employer, for duplicity during the 
period in which they are alleged to have acted in clear conflict with Harcourt's business interests. We think the absence of any 
such authority amply belies WestPEG's theorization that Harcourt's claim is either frivolous or meritless. "
1155,9," Here, for example, WestPEG argues that, having pleaded that the New York action was a sham, a dismissal is precluded 
since, under the rubric of Rule 12(b)(6), WestPEG's allegations must be accepted as true. We need not, and do not, reach that 
issue here, however, for the parties have provided materials, which emanate from beyond the boundaries of the pleadings, for 
our consideration and, accordingly, WestPEG may not rest upon the bare allegations of its Complaint. Rule 56(e), Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure. Accordingly, we have no occasion to consider the applicability of the Court's holding in Skinder-Strauss v. Mass. Continuing 
Legal Educ., 870 F. Supp. 8, 10 (D. Mass. 1994), where the Court denied a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal on the ground, among 
others, that a pleading, which asserts that the underlying lawsuit was ""objectively baseless,"" has adequately stated a cause of 
action. We would merely note that, there, the Court was not considering materials outside of the pleadings, was not confronted 
by a Motion for Summary Judgment and, ultimately, the Court severed and stayed the Noerr-Pennington issues until the 
underlying action could be resolved. Given the Court's express recognition, that no further proceedings on the Noerr-Pennington 
issues would be necessary if the Court concluded that the underlying ""suit was not objectively meritless,"" we read Skinder-
Strauss as one means by which a Court may defer a ruling on Noerr-Pennington issues without subjecting the parties to the 
needless expense of pretrial processing and discovery. If applicable here, then the holding in Skinder-Strauss would counsel the 
staying of these proceedings until the New York action was finally resolved -- a result that neither party here endorses."
1155,10," WestPEG seems to suggest that the status of Chess and Levine, as employees-at-will, insulates them from the breaches of 
duty and from the claims of fraud, that Harcourt has advanced in the State Court. Unfortunately, WestPEG offers no authority to 
that effect. Rather, WestPEG relies upon several cases for the following proposition: HN8[
] In the absence of a breach of fiduciary duty, a covenant not to compete, or fraud, an at will employee is free to 
compete with his former employer. * * * Indeed, absent the use of plaintiff's time or facilities, and absent diversion of 
plaintiff's business, the defendants could have lawfully incorporated a competing business while still employed by plaintiff. Headquarters Buick-Nissan, Inc. v. Michael Oldsmobile, 149 A.D.2d 302, 303, 539 N.Y.S.2d 355, 356 (N.Y. App. Div. 1989). Of course, this is the precise authority upon which Harcourt has premised its action against Chess and Levine. Moreover, we 
have closely reviewed the other New York authorities that WestPEG has cited and we find them to be readily distinguishable 
from the circumstances presented by Harcourt's State claims and, therefore, to be inapposite. "
1156,11," In this respect, we adhere to the following counsel of the Supreme Court in Professional Real Estate: Where, as here, there is no dispute over the predicate facts of the underlying legal proceeding, a court may decide 
probable cause as a matter of law. Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Industries, supra at 1930. Based on the Record before us, we conclude that Harcourt had probable cause to sue Chess and Levine, as a matter of law. 
Stated otherwise, given the absence of a contested Record on the objective prong of the sham exception, we hold that ""an 
objective litigant could conclude that [Harcourt's] suit [was] reasonably calculated to elicit a favorable outcome."" Id. at 1928."
1156,12," We think this fact is corroborated by the absence of any dispositive Motion, in the underlying State Court proceeding, that is 
premised upon its purportedly sham or frivolous nature. While a ""sham"" lawsuit need not equate with one in which Judgment 
may be entered as a matter of law, we seriously doubt that any litigant will permit a wholly baseless, frivolous claim to be 
prosecuted without earnestly obtaining relief from the Court at the earliest possible moment. Indeed, we think the effort of 
Levine, to excuse himself from the jurisdiction of the New York Court, on the mixed factual and legal issue of in personam 
jurisdiction, attests to the objectively legal bases for Harcourt's substantive claims, since no similar Motion to Dismiss, on 
grounds of frivolousness, has been filed by either Levine or Chess."
1156,13," Our holding in this respect is entirely consistent with what we understand to be the prevailing weight of authority. See, Fischer 
Sand and Aggregate v. City of Lakeville, 874 F. Supp. 957, 960 (D. Minn. 1994); Supervalu, Inc. f/k/a Super Valu Stores, Inc. v. 
Donald L. Stowe and W. Douglas Cable, Civ. No. 3-93-55, Slip Op. at 14 (D. Minn. May 6, 1994); see also, Carroll Touch, Inc. v. 
Electro Mechanical Systems, Inc., 15 F.3d 1573, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1993); Liberty Lake Investments, Inc. v. Magnuson, 12 F.3d 
155, 159 (9th Cir. 1993); Music Center v. Prestini Musical Instruments Corp., 874 F. Supp. 543, 549 (E.D.N.Y. 1995); Harris 
Custom Builders, Inc. v. Hoffmeyer, 834 F. Supp. 256, 261-62 (N.D. Ill. 1993); cf., Clorox Co. v. Inland Empire Wholesale 
Grocers, Inc., 874 F. Supp. 1065, 1068-69 (C.D. Cal. 1994); Edmondson and Gallagher v. Alban Towers Tenants, 829 F. Supp. 
420, 427 (D.C.C. 1993), rev'd on other grounds, 48 F.3d 1260, 1995 WL 96621 (D.C.Cir. 1995). Indeed, in a decision cited by WestPEG in a post-Hearing submission, the Court flatly asserted that ""whether a claim is baseless 
is a question of law."" El Cajon Cinemas v. American Multi-Cinema, 832 F. Supp. 1395, 1398 (S.D. Cal. 1993). We need not 
accede to that observation here, for under the more exacting analysis of Rule 56, we find that, as a matter of law, Harcourt's 
claim is not objectively baseless. "
1157,14," As the Supreme Court has expressly recognized, if subjective considerations controlled the determination of the sham 
exception, then the Noerr-Pennington immunity would be undermined, if not vitiated. The result that WestPEG urges, which 
would require a trial of every case in which the motivations of a litigant may be properly questioned, clearly would effectuate the 
result that the Supreme Court rejected -- unequivocally -- in Professional Real Estate. Professional Real Estate Investors v. 
Columbia Pictures, supra at 1931; see also, Music Center v. Prestini Musical Instruments Corp., supra at 549."
1157,15," Although not addressed by the parties, we further conclude that Noerr-Pennington immunity extends to WestPEG's action 
under the Minnesota Antitrust Law of 1971, Minnesota Statutes Section 325D.49 et seq., and to the acts of Harcourt which 
were incidental to the commencement of the New York action, such as the correspondence which it transmitted to Chess, Levine 
and West. See, Minnesota Statutes Section 325D.55, Subdivision 2(a); Computer Associates Intern. v. American Fundware, 831 
F. Supp. 1516, 1521-23 (D. Colo. 1993); Supervalu, Inc. f/k/a Super Valu Stores, Inc. v. Donald L. Stowe and W. Douglas Cable, 
supra at 6; Johnson v. Con-Vey/Keystone, Inc., 856 F. Supp. 1443, 1448 (D. Or. 1994). "
1158,16," As the Court further noted in Associated General Contractors v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 528 n. 
17, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 103 S. Ct. 897 (1983): Certainly in [an antitrust] case of this magnitude, a district court must retain the power to insist upon some specificity in 
pleading before allowing a potentially massive factual controversy to proceed. "
1165,1," Section 1 of Title 15, U.S.C., states, in pertinent part: HN1[
] Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce 
among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. Section 2 states, in pertinent part: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of 
a felony. . . ."

1165,3, LSA-R.S. 51:1401 et seq.
1165,4," Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides, in pertinent part: HN2[
] ""Any person who shall be injured by his business or property 
by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefore . . . ."" Successful plaintiffs can recover triple damages. Id. Section 16 provides states, in pertinent part: ""Any person, firm or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief 
. . . against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws. . . ."" Successful plaintiffs suing under this provision 
can also recover attorneys' fees. "
1166,5," The subscribers are not typically patients but, for example, employers supplying health care coverage for their employees."
1166,6," As noted, East Jefferson also moves for summary judgment on the basis of immunity from state and federal antitrust claims. 
The Court addresses this motion in Section VI, infra. "
1168,7," Horizontal combinations occur among traders at one level with a purpose to exclude direct competitors from the market. Id. 
Vertical combinations involve parties at different levels of the market, designed to exclude direct competitors of some of the 
members of the vertical combination. Id. "
1170,8," In Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 50, n. 16, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 2557, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977), the 
Supreme Court stated: ""Per se rules thus require the Court to make broad generalizations about the social utility of particular 
commercial practices. The probability that anticompetitive consequences will result from a practice and the severity of those 
consequences must be balanced against its procompetitive consequences."""
1170,9," The Court notes that Construction Aggregate relied not only on Klor's and other Supreme Court cases for this proposition but 
also on various Fifth Circuit cases, including Abadir & Co. v. First Mississippi Corp., 651 F.2d 422, 426-28 (5th Cir. 1981) and 
Red Diamond Supply, Inc. v. Liquid Carbonic Corp., 637 F.2d 1001, 1004-07 (5th Cir.) cert. denied, 454 U.S. 827, 102 S. Ct. 
119, 70 L. Ed. 2d 102 (1981). Thus, the Court comfortably relies on Seagood Trading and Construction Aggregate as consistent 
with Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit law on this issue. "
1171,10," The court of appeals recognized that one of the alternatives to an HMO was a preferred provider organization, such as in the 
present case. Id. "
1172,11," This finding does not conflict with the Court's earlier ruling on a motion in limine on the same issue. The Court denied the 
defendant's motion in limine to prevent plaintiff from introducing evidence on this issue, finding the evidence potentially relevant. 
Obviously, at trial the Court would have required plaintiff to lay the proper foundation for the introduction of this evidence. On a 
motion for summary judgment, however, the non-mover has the burden of coming forward with proof in the form of depositions, 
affidavits, pleadings, etc., that supports its contentions. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); Liquid Air Corporation, supra. "
1174,12," Both the ""participating hospital"" contract and the ""member hospital"" contract."
1174,13," Two plaintiffs were dismissed on summary judgment as lacking standing and a third was found by the jury to have suffered no 
antitrust injury, leaving Wesley's contentions at issue on appeal. Id. at 956, nn. 2 and 3."
1174,14," These injuries included having to advertise to reassure patients that Blue Cross subscribers were still welcome at Wesley, 
reducing prices to retain market share, and sustaining a loss in patients. Id. at 962. "
1175,15," To the extent that plaintiff argues in its opposition memorandum that the 10% increase in prices as set forth in the Louviere-
Betts memorandum is also evidence of anticompetitve effects, this argument also fails because it is factually limited only to the 
SMA market, not the market on the east bank of Jefferson. "
1188,1," While this action resulted from consolidation of two actions, one brought by each of the parties, I shall refer to the franchisees 
as plaintiffs throughout this Report. "
1189,2," There is a dispute as to the scope of the required logoed products that Little Caesar franchisees must provide. Plaintiffs assert 
that the packaging on many of the foodstuffs as well as paper products are also logoed. Defendants assert that the only logoed 
products are the paper products and packaged condiments used in distributing their food to customers. Defendants have 
recently filed a motion for summary judgment over the scope of logoed products. "
1192,3," Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d at § 1781, notes: In this connection it uniformly has been held that HN11[
] differences among the members as to the amount of damages 
incurred does not mean that a class action would be inappropriate. Rather, the question of damages can be severed from 
that of liability and tried on an individual basis. Allowing split proceedings furthers the Rule 23 purpose of promoting judicial 
economy . . . . (Footnote omitted.) "
1193,4," See, e.g., Story Parchment v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co., 282 U.S. 555, 562, 75 L. Ed. 544, 51 S. Ct. 248 (1931): The rule which precludes recovery of uncertain damages applies to such as are not the certain result of the wrong, not to 
those damages which are definitely attributable to the wrong and only uncertain in respect of their amount. Id. at 92-92 n.8. "
1196,5," While defendants argue that demonstration of coercion by proofs extrinsic to the contract should preclude class treatment 
under Rule 23(b)(8), it is clear the Bogosian's proof of the practical economic effects would require such extrinsic proofs, 
probably by an economic expert, as to the practical market effects and limitations a gas station operator faced in light of the 
various contract terms."
1196,6," Bogosian noted that several cases involving coercion in a tie-in setting dealt with a pattern of making a request or suggestion 
that the buyer acquire the tied product from the seller ""coupled with pressure, intimidation, in short . . . coercion."" 561 F.2d at 
451. It is clear in a case in which the tie is to be established by a request or a suggestion followed by pressure, intimidation, or 
traditional types of coercion, that individual proofs would generally predominate and a class action would be inappropriate."
1196,7," Other courts have explained why coercion is implied where a contract explicitly requires the tie because a contract ""is backed 
by the force of law."" Halverson v. Convenient Food Mart, Inc., 69 F.R.D. 331, 335 (N.D. Ill. 1974); McCoy v. Convenient Food 
Mart, Inc., 69 F.R.D. 337, 340 (N.D. Ill. 1975). Coercion remains a necessary element of an unlawful tying arrangement but it is 
inferred on a class-wide basis; a contractual provision is coercive in and of itself because it is backed by the force of law. See 
also, 7- Eleven Franchise Antitrust Litigation, 1972 Trade Cases P 74,156 (N.D.Cal. 1972). "
1198,8," Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp., 561 F.2d 434 (3d Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1086, 55 L. Ed. 2d 791, 98 S. Ct. 1280 (1978), 
noted that the rule against ties seeks to deter the act of the seller conditioning sale of one product on the purchase of another."" 
561 F.2d at 450 (emphasis in the original). ""The issue is whether the seller acted in a certain way, not what the buyer's state of 
mind would have been absent the seller's action."" Id."
1198,9," Defendants here argue that this requires an inquiry into whether Little Caesar franchisees felt coercion to buy from Blue Line. 
Yet, for reasons stated below, the actual and anticompetitive effects in the marketplace can occur without proof that the 
individual franchisees knew of them or of the reasons for them. Antitrust laws are intended to protect the weak, the ignorant, the 
gullible, and the foolish consumer as well as the perceptive, informed, and prudent, although the decisions of the latter type of 
consumer are critical to efficient operation of the market."
1198,10," While some tying cases also involve removing the buyer's freedom not to buy the tied product at all, that aspect of tying was 
not involved in Bogosian nor is it involved in the present case because the buyers need the tied product from some source in 
order to carry on their business."
1198,11," This is the distinction the Third Circuit notes in Ungar between ""coercion"" and ""individual coercion."" 531 F.2d at 1219. As the 
Ungar court notes, ""coercion"" is the relevant term for substantive tying law, but in a class action case the court must also 
address whether coercion (or tying) is to be proved by evidence of ""individual coercion"" or in some other manner. "
1199,12," The district court in Bogosian (Remand) quotes several portions of the Jefferson Parish opinion in support of the position that 
Jefferson Parish's analysis is closer to the focus on the buyer's state of mind in Ungar v. Dunkin' Donuts of America, Inc., 531 
F.2d 1211 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 823, 50 L. Ed. 2d 84, 97 S. Ct. 74 (1976), than to the Third Circuit's analysis of the 
seller's actions in Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp., 561 F.2d 434 (3d Cir. 1977). Ungar required plaintiffs to prove coercion as an 
element of a tying claim. The Third Circuit in Bogosian limited the requirement of ""proof of actual coercion"" to cases where the 
tie-in is ""not reflected in the agreement or in the operation of its terms."" Bogosian at 450-51. Yet, notwithstanding the similar 
focus on the buyer in Jefferson Parish and Ungar, the Bogosian district court did not decertify the class because it reasoned that 
even if coercion was a separate element of a tying claim after Jefferson Parish, this did not mean ""that it must be established on 
an individual basis."" Bogosian (Remand), 596 F. Supp. at 76 (quoting Ungar, 531 F.2d at 1219). The district court felt that 
Ungar's need for individual proofs of coercion was limited to its facts where the plaintiff placed no reliance on express contractual tie-ins. In Bogosian, the [Third Circuit] noted that plaintiffs may be 
able to prove reliance on the lease agreements themselves, thus rendering the ""individual coercion doctrine"" of Ungar 
inapposite."""
1199,596, F. Supp. at 76.
1199,13, See n.5 above as to the proof extrinsic to the contract that must have been needed in Bogosian.
1199,14," The Consumers Power Company Securities Litigation case, cited above, with which 1 had years of familiarity, was an 
exceedingly complicated fraud case alleging a litany of alleged misstatements, half-truths, and overly optimistic forecasts over 
an extended number of years on the building of the aborted Midland nuclear power plant Multiple subclasses invested in multiple 
time frames involving a variety of disclosures and non-disclosures at the respective times of investment. Yet, these inordinately 
complicated facts were common to some or all subclasses. "
1200,15," If the issue of whether defendants would have purchased from Blue Line at higher costs (even if they had a choice) was 
relevant, then individual proofs of each franchisee would predominate."
1200,16," As noted below, whether any other distributors would have entered the regional markets to compete with Blue Line if the 
alleged tie-in was ended is relevant to whether the alleged tying behavior had an impact on the plaintiffs. Whether the 
franchisees would have bought from an alternate distributor would be relevant to their willingness to enter the market and 
compete. "
1201,17," An affidavit provided by plaintiffs' economic experts, Stephen Siwek and Dr. Philip Nelson, shows how these loyal infra-
marginal consumers are hurt by a tying arrangement just like the marginal consumer who would switch sellers if better service, 
quality, or price is offered by a competitor."
1201,18," As noted in Halverson v. Convenient Food Mart, Inc., 69 F.R.D. 331, 336 (N.D. Ill. 1974), regarding class certification: ""It may 
well be that no antitrust violations are involved. Yet that possible result does not defeat a class action at this juncture of the suit."" 
In a second class action ruling in a companion case, the same judge warned against ""the merits. . . being tried under the guise 
of a motion for class-certification."" McCoy v. Convenient Food Mart, Inc., 69 F.R.D. 337, 341 (N.D. Ill. 1975). "
1202,19," Martino v. McDonald's System, Inc., 81 F.R.D. 81 (N.D. Ill. 1979), (prior to the express tie-in in 1964, from 1961-1964 
McDonald's had a uniform policy of tying a lease from a subsidiary of the defendant to McDonald's franchisees.)"
1202,20," Hill v. A-T-O, Inc., 535 F.2d 1349, 1354 (2d Cir. 1976) (The sale of a vacuum cleaner was tied to the sale of membership in a 
buying club. The sale of these items was done by door-to-door salespersons, and it was undisputed that the only way one could 
buy a membership in the buying club was to also purchase a compact vacuum cleaner.)"
1202,21," In Image Technical Services v. Eastman Kodak Co., 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12652, 1994 W.L. 508737 (N.D.Calif. 1994), 
Kodak was selling replacement parts for its copiers only to buyers who agreed not to buy service for the machines from 
independent service organizations. In certifying a class action, the district court addressed the 23(b)(3) issue of predominance 
by noting that plaintiffs sought to prove coercion under Ninth Circuit case law that permits coercion to be implied from proof that 
""an appreciable number of buyers have accepted burdensome terms, such as a tie-in, and there exists sufficient economic 
power in tying market."" Moore v. Jas. H. Matthews and Co., 550 F.2d 1207, 1217 (9th Cir. 1977). See also, Krehl v. Baskin-
Robbins Ice Cream Co., 78 F.R.D. 108, 118-19 (C.D. Cal. 1978)."
1202,22," While the Ninth Circuit accepts such proofs as adequate proofs of coercion, the Third Circuit in Ungar v. Dunkin' Donuts, 531 
F.2d 1211, 1225 (3d Cir. 1976), held that such proofs constitute some evidence of coercion,"" but the Third Circuit could not 
""accept the proposition that such proof, alone, would suffice to establish, prima facie the coercion element of an illegal tie-in 
claim."""
1202,23," Krehl v. Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream Co., 78 F.R.D. 108, 118-19 (C.D. Cal. 1978). The defendant had admitted to the Federal 
Trade Commission that its subsidiary was the prime lessor on all of its stores, and that all stores were fully equipped and ready 
for operation when turned over to a franchisee. Id. at 118. The court noted that in the absence of an admission of the universal 
acceptance of the lease and initial equipment package, the court would not certify for class treatment of the alleged tie between 
the franchise and equipment replacements which it deemed would require individual proof of coercion. Id. at 119. While the court 
found that the coercion element was amenable to common proof on the tie between the franchise and the lease and equipment 
package, these claims were not certified for class treatment because common proofs did not exist on the fact of damage with 
respect to these alleged ties. "
1203,24," Halverson v. Convenient Food Mart, Inc., 69 F.R.D. 331, 335 (N.D. Ill. 1974), specifically notes the two types of proof of an 
illegal tie being an (1) express contractual obligation, and (2) a course of dealings ""extrinsic to any express agreement."" It adds 
that ""prevailing authorities indicate that these modes of proof also provide a reasonable test for determining the propriety of a 
class action."" For reasons noted elsewhere in this Report, I believe these pre-Bogosian authorities are less determinative today."
1203,25," Plaintiffs do point to certain individual instances of pressure, threat, and intimidation related to a different claim concerning 
whether individual franchisees could sell items at a price above that stated in the national price-point advertisements. "
1204,26," Even for the earlier contracts requiring defendant's approval, class certification was denied because plaintiffs failed to show 
their number was so large that joinder would be impracticable. 74 F.R.D. at 88. "
1205,27," The Halverson case did involve a franchise term that was in use prior to December 1972 and that required purchases from 
designated suppliers which did involve common proof concerning ""the legality of a standard clause."" Halverson, 69 F.R.D. at 
336. Yet, given potential antagonism among franchisees, the court did not consider a class action to be the superior method for 
determining that issue and did not certify a class. Id. at 337. "
1207,28, See n. 1 above regarding defendants' motion for summary judgment over scope of logoed products.
1207,29," AmeriServ is a large food distribution operation that services fast food restaurants at nearly 6,000 locations in 19 states and 
includes franchisees of Kentucky Fried Chicken, Burger King, Dairy Queen, Wendy's, and Applebee's."
1207,30," Defendants contest that AmeriServ distributed to the other national chain customers it serves in all states where it does 
business or from all of its warehouses. "
1208,31," PYA Monarch used to service, west coast outlets until shortly after Blue Line opened a distributorship in Anaheim, California, 
in October 1987. On July 29, 1993, franchisee Bobbie Moore sought to have PYA serve as a distributor from its South Carolina 
warehouse. This application was recently approved."
1208,32," Plaintiffs have supplied an affidavit from William Burgess, who used to work for Blue Line and now works for AmeriServ, who 
stated that AmeriServ needed access to the logoed products to compete because, while these items were a small percentage of 
the entire package sold to distributors, they were the items in which the mark-up profit margins were the highest. (See also, 
Burgess Dep. at 155-56.) Separate submissions on AmeriServ pricing mark-ups on Little Caesar supplies show the percentage 
mark-up on paper products were over three times the average for eight food product categories. In their Second Supplemental 
Brief, defendants note that the three recently approved alternate suppliers, PYA in Greenfield, South Carolina, Schloss & Kahn 
in Montgomery, Alabama, and Gordon's in Oklahoma, were provided access to all items, including logoed paper items (Deal 
Nov. 30, 1994, Dep. at 75, 77, 110). Defendants also note that in the past PYA was willing to compete with Blue Line without 
access to logoed products."
1208,33," In a January 1989 memo, Deal noted that it remained to be seen whether PYA could remain competitive once they were 
denied access to purchasing from suppliers under Blue Line's national contracts, and also when PYA was denied access to 
""proprietary/trademark products."""
1208,34," They assert that their proofs rely far more heavily on proof that through adoption and misuse of the Licensing Agreement and similar conduct, 
defendants improperly leveraged their control over logoed products and made it impossible for potential competition to 
become actual competition. Plaintiffs' Supp. Brief at 3. They assert that by September 1988 plaintiffs' prior practice of merely disapproving distributors needed supplementation, Blue Line's head, David Deal, masterminded the 
plan to continue to control distribution by improperly controlling logoed and proprietary products. Plaintiffs' Supp. Brief at 5, referring to Deal 12/2/94 Dep. Exh. 273. "
1209,35, Defendants contest the use of facts occurring before the statutory limitations period in this suit.
1209,36," Little Caesar asserts that at this time these two distributors were not distributors in compliance with LCE's confidentiality 
agreement at the time, and for this reason were not listed. They were subsequently listed when they agreed to comply with this 
provision. "
1210,37," This, like many issues, is disputed. Plaintiffs' experts assert that AmeriServ, which served multiple restaurant chains, operated 
larger warehouses than Blue Line and realized greater economies of scale."
1210,38," Defendants assert that they know of no case in which a class has been certified or a tie-in claim has been sustained where the 
class plaintiffs were not aware that they had lost their freedom to purchase the items from a source other than the defendant."
1210,39," All franchisees must also buy Pan! Pan! dough mix and a special LCE spice blend from Blue Line, but plaintiffs do not appear 
to be challenging defendants' rights to be the exclusive source of these ""super proprietary"" items. "
1211,40," At the initial oral argument on this motion, counsel for defendants argued that if the Court was going to certify a class, it should 
be no broader that these franchisees who were expressly precluded from seeking an alternate source of logoed goods."
1211,41," LCE notes that during this period there were only six requests, including plaintiff Gary Smith's May 1992 request for AmeriServ 
to service him and other franchisees in the southeastern United States. Of these six only two were denied. Four were withdrawn."
1211,42," Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F.2d 891, 901 (9th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 816, 50 L. Ed. 2d 75, 97 S. Ct. 57 (1976), stated: Neither the possibility that a plaintiff will be unable to prove his allegations, nor the possibility that the later course of the suit 
might unforeseeably prove the original decision to certify a class wrong, is a basis for declining to certify a class which 
apparently satisfies the Rule."
1211,500," F.2d 86, 92."
1211,43," Defendants choose to characterize these as ""highly unorthodox"" instead of ""novel."" Defendants' Supplemental Brief at 17. "
1212,44," As noted above, a summary judgment motion is pending on this issue."
1212,45," Compare Siegel v. Chicken Delight, 448 F.2d 43 (9th Cir. 1971), with Krehl v. Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream Co., 664 F.2d 1348 
(9th Cir. 1982)."
1212,46," Questions (16)-(19) would require that some threshold number of franchisees would switch to these potential alternate 
distributors' which means these distributors would have to offer sufficient price/service advantages over Blue Line to counter its 
asserted market advantages, including its satisfied and its LCE owned (""captive"") customer base. AmeriServ's rejected proposal 
anticipated servicing 100 franchise units. "
1213,47," Plaintiffs' experts' opinion on the impact of higher prices is presently based on a market analysis of AmeriServ in Gary Smith's 
region only. While plaintiffs would like this Court to presume impact by way of higher prices by analogy to price-fixing law, it is by 
no means clear that this analogy holds in the absence of proof that an able and willing alternate distributor could have entered 
each region and offered better services and lower prices than Blue Line."
1213,48, This is not to deny that there are also common proofs relevant to all franchisees. 
1214,49," While plaintiffs' experts proffer several formula for actual measure of individual damages, this is not essential for class 
certification because class efficiencies exist even if individual damages need be tried separately. Yet, if a formula for 
approximating individual damages is ultimately approved in this case, it also will need to consider the mark-ups and profit 
margins of the particular alternate distributor in the particular region of the plaintiff being awarded damages."
1214,50," When later events demonstrated that common or generalized proofs are not in fact available, partial or complete 
decertification of a class is appropriate. See, e.g., Nichols v. Mobile Bd. of Realtors, Inc., 675 F.2d 671 (5th Cir. 1982)."
1214,51," 500 national franchisees divided by 16 regions would yield an average of 31 franchisees per region. Whether these three 
regions involve a greater number than this or fewer can be addressed later. "
1215,52," These plaintiffs may have a far simpler case to prove, or an enhanced chance for settlement, if they are not held ""captive"" by 
the franchisees who were contractually entitled to request an alternate distributor of logoed products. If this is the case, lawyers 
representing them may have a conflict under the Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 1.7(a) and/or 1.7(b), which rules are 
made applicable to attorneys practicing before this Court. L.R. 111.1(d)(2)."
1215,53," Defendants note that in this action LCE has also commenced a declaratory judgment action against Plaintiff Smith to 
determine that LCE has not breached the franchise agreements by refusing to approve an alternative distributor to Blue Line. 
Plaintiffs assert that since both sides are seeking declaratory relief on this issue, the matter should be certified under Rule 
23(b)(2) to prevent relitigation of this common issue by other potential plaintiffs. "
1226,1," The actual patent numbers are 4,862,794; 5,184,538; and 5,120,265. The Court notes that, by Order dated March 21, 1995, 
the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted Laitram's Petition for Mandamus and, among other things, 
ordered that the declaratory judgment action be dismissed in regard to the '538 and '265 patents. (R.Doc. 238.)"
1226,2," Laitram brought a motion to dismiss the counterclaim previously but supported it with matters outside the pleadings. The former 
judge to whom this matter had been assigned construed the motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment and denied it 
without prejudice. (Document 90, Order and Reasons, entered April 29, 1994.) "
1227,3," In its opposition, Skrmetta also contends that the alleged conspiracy claim falls within a recognized exception to the principle 
set forth in Copperweld, i.e., because the employees of Laitram received certain financial rewards, they had independent 
financial interests in the success of the conspiracy under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. See H&B Equipment Co., Inc. v. 
International Harvester, 577 F.2d 239, 244 (5th Cir. 1978). This argument fails for two reasons. First, although Skrmetta argues that one employee, Brent Ledet, received $ 100,000 and 
other defendants have been likewise rewarded, Skrmetta offers no deposition testimony, answers to interrogatories or otherwise 
to support these allegations. Thus, the argument falls short under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Moreover, the exception in H&B Equipment is not as broad as Skrmetta contends. The Fifth Circuit defined the exception as ""the 
rare instance in which employees have an independent personal stake in achieving the object of the conspiracy."" Id. In rejecting 
the applicability of the exception in H&B Equipment, the court of appeals distinguished several cases relied on by the exception's 
proponent. ""In the cited cases, HN4[
] the employees had interests in economic entities separate from the principal defendant. 
. . . Without such an organization legally distinct from the principal defendant, it would be impossible for an employee to have an 
interest that was truly 'independent.'"" Id. "
1228,," Therefore, the mere fact that the employees of Laitram received financial awards is insufficient for the exception to apply in this 
case."
1228,4, Again Skrmetta does not address this point in its opposition to summary judgment.
1228,5," Nevertheless, as will be shown in the next section, Laitram is entitled to summary judgment on the claims involving Point 
Adams and the lessening of competition because there was no predatory pricing. "
1230,6," In Eastman Kodak the Supreme Court found that Kodak's control of nearly 100% of the parts market and 80% to 95% of the 
service market, ""with no readily available substitutes, [was], however, sufficient to survive summary judgment under the more "
1231,," stringent monopoly standard of Section 2."" Id. at    , 112 S. Ct. at 2090. Further, one brand of product can constitute a separate 
market. Id. at    , 112 S. Ct. at 2090. "
1232,7," Again, Skrmetta does not offer any argument in opposition to this issue. "
1234,8," Even so, the Court finds that on the record before it, genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether the Skrmetta cooker is 
a copy of the '646 patent. Laitram relies on documents produced at the deposition testimony of Raphael Skrmetta to the effect 
that the Skrmetta machine ""looks and works like"" the Laitram machine (Exh. N, Laitram's memorandum in support, R.Doc. 221) 
and is identical in length to the Laitram machine. (Exh. O, R.Doc. 221.) However, Exh. N also lists two differences, the first being 
in the number of steam boxes below and above the cooking shrimp (three in the Skrmetta machine versus two in the Laitram 
machine) and access for cleaning of the machine. Similarly, Exh. O talks about differences between the machines. This 
establishes genuine issues of material fact as to whether the Skrmetta machine is different from the Laitram machine. Additionally, Skrmetta's answer to Laitram's Interrogatory No. 14 specifically lists differences in the machines. (Exh. F to 
Skrmetta's memorandum in opposition, R.Doc. 229.) This rebuts the deposition testimony in the form of tables in Laitram's."
1234,9," HN28[
] This claim is made under the Court's supplemental jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. § 3667."
1234,10," Both parties argue whether Laitram had an ulterior purpose in bringing this suit and whether this constituted abuse of process. 
However, the case cited by Laitram involving motive, Wilcon, Inc. v. The Travelers Indemnity Co., 654 F.2d 976, 983 (5th Cir. 
1981), is inapposite for it concerns an abuse of process claim under Mississippi law, not under Louisiana law. "
1236,**," The panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument. Fed. R. App. P. 34(a) and Ninth Circuit Rule 
34-4. "
1238,*," This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 
Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3. "
1241,1," The Drachs rely heavily on Hatley v. American Quarter Horse Ass'n, 552 F.2d 646 (5th Cir. 1977) to support their theory that a 
due process right exists under Arizona law. Hatley, however, construes a right created by the Texas state constitution. We reject 
any argument for such a right under Arizona law which relies on Hatley. "
1245,1," The district court has not certified a class. Our examination of jurisdiction reflects the allegation of the plaintiffs and their 
invocation of jurisdiction -- a putative class."

1247,4," 28 U.S.C. § 1367 provides in relevant part as follows: HN6[
] (a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as expressly provided otherwise by Federal statute, in any civil 
action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all 
other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case 
or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution. Such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that 
involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties. (b) In any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section 1332 of this title, the 
district courts shall not have supplemental jurisdiction under subsection (a) over claims by plaintiffs against persons made 
parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or over claims by persons proposed to be 
joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19 of such rules, or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under Rule 24 of such rules, when 
exercising supplemental jurisdiction over such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section 
1332. (c) The district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim under subsection (a) if -- (1) the claim raises a novel or complex issue of State law, (2) the claim substantially predominates over the claim or claims over which the district court has original jurisdiction, (3) the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction, or (4) in exceptional circumstances, there are other compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction.

1248,7," This circuit has twice broached the question, but never answered it. In More v. Intelcom Support Servs., Inc., we noted that § 
1367 might affect the Zahn rule, but declined to decide that because the action at issue had been filed before § 1367 took effect. 
See 960 F.2d 466, 473 (5th Cir. 1992). Later, in Watson v. Shell Oil Co., we reasoned that the Zahn rule would demand 
dismissal of class members' claims below the jurisdictional threshold. See 979 F.2d 1014, 1021 (5th Cir. 1992). However, that 
case had been filed before § 1367 took effect, and the opinion makes no mention of that statute. See id. at 1021 & n.27. In any 
event, Watson has been vacated. When this court ordered the case reheard en banc, see 990 F.2d 805 (5th Cir. 1993), the 
panel opinion in Watson was vacated, see 5th Cir. R. 35 (Internal Operating Procedure), and the en banc rehearing never 
occurred because the parties settled and the appeal was dismissed. The Third Circuit is the only other circuit to have considered the question. In Packard v. Provident Nat'l Bank, the court noted the 
conflict among authorities on our question, but declined to resolve it. See 994 F.2d 1039, 1045-46 n.9 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 114 
S. Ct. 440 (1993)."

1249,9," The impressive array of Professors Burbank, Mengler, and Rowe has observed that ""it would have been better had the statute 
dealt explicitly with this problem, and the legislative history was an attempt to correct the oversight."" Rowe et al., supra, 40 
Emory L.J. at 960 n.90. The have noted that the supplemental jurisdiction statute is ""not a perfect effort."" Thomas D. Rowe, Jr., 
et al., A Coda on Supplemental Jurisdiction, 40 Emory L.J. 993, 993 (1991). Some disagree and with inexplicably sharp language, given the reality that most mistakes become ""clear"" once they are 
identified. See, e.g., 1 Moore et al., supra, § 0.97[5], at 928 (blaming ""Congressional sloth in drafting the supplemental 
jurisdiction statute"" for confusion over whether Zahn survives § 1367); Richard D. Freer, Compounding Confusion and

Work: What Happens When Congress Doesn't Do Its Job, 40 Emory L.J. 1007, 1007 (1991) (calling § 1367(b) a ""nightmare of 
draftsmanship""). "
1305,1," The PGA is a national, nonprofit organization of golf professionals. It is geographically divided into six divisions, each of which 
is further divided into several sections, such as the MAPGA."
1305,2," The district court granted summary judgment to Appellees on two counts (Eight and Thirteen). Seabury does not appeal this 
ruling. "
1306,3," Maryland law specifies that the interpretation of the federal antitrust statutes controls the interpretation of the Maryland Antitrust 
Act. See Md. Com. Law II Code Ann. § 11-202(a)(2) (Michie 1990). Accordingly, we need discuss only federal law. "
1307,4," Seabury also claimed that the PGA conspired with the Golf Manufacturers and Distributors Association (GMDA), a trade 
association of vendors of golf equipment and apparel. We agree with the district court that Seabury failed to produce any 
evidence of an agreement between the PGA and the GMDA and conclude that Seabury's appeal as to this issue is without merit. 
See Seabury Management, Inc., 1994 WL 772873, at * 5-6. "
1308,5," At trial, Seabury presented evidence that the decline in revenues for the 1991 Show was due to a severe storm that struck the 
Atlantic City area during the week of the Show, making travel to and from Atlantic City difficult."
1308,6," The dissent asserts that our rejection of Rey's direct profits calculation is necessarily a rejection of the comparability of the 
West Coast Show and the East Coast Show. See post at 15-16. This is not the case, however. The lost profits calculation is 
based on two premises: first, that the 1991 East Coast Show earned direct profits of $ 158,000; and second, that a reasonable 
jury could find the growth rates of the East Coast Show and the West Coast Show to be comparable. We reject only the former 
premise. "
1309,7," The parties apparently do not contest that it was appropriate to apply the multipliers to projected values for the 1992 East Coast 
Show."
1309,8," Even if application of a multiplier derived from the direct profits of the West Coast Show to the direct profits of the East Coast 
Show was inappropriate--which we do not believe to be the case given that Rey was comparing corresponding numbers for both 
shows--at the very least, application of the gross revenue multiplier produced a range of values of $ 1.8 to 2.3 million."
1309,9," We leave it to the district court to determine in the first instance the most appropriate manner of resolving the issue of 
compensatory damages on remand."
1309,10," The punitive damages award was premised on the tortious interference claims (Counts Two and Three). Because the PGA 
stipulated that it would be liable for any damages resulting from the MAPGA's breach of its contract with Seabury, the district 
court did not submit these claims to the jury; instead, the instructions related to Counts Two and Three were subsumed in the 
instructions on punitive damages. "

(plurality opinion) (""Our national government is one of delegated powers alone. Under our federal system the administration of 
criminal justice rests with the States except as Congress, acting within the scope of those delegated powers, has created 
offenses against the United States""). When Congress criminalizes conduct already denounced as criminal by the States, it 
effects a ""'change in the sensitive relation between federal and state criminal jurisdiction.'"" United States v. Enmons, 410 U.S. 
396, 411-412, 35 L. Ed. 2d 379, 93 S. Ct. 1007 (1973) (quoting United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 349, 30 L. Ed. 2d 488, 92 
S. Ct. 515 (1971)). The Government acknowledges that § 922(q) ""displace[s] state policy choices in . . . that its prohibitions apply 
even in States that have chosen not to outlaw the conduct in question."" Brief for United States 29, n. 18; see also Statement of 
President George Bush on Signing the Crime Control Act of 1990, 26 Weekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 1944, 1945 (Nov. 29, 1990) 
(""Most egregiously, section [922(q)] inappropriately overrides legitimate State firearms laws with a new and unnecessary Federal 
law. The policies reflected in these provisions could legitimately be adopted by the States, but they should not be imposed upon 
the States by the Congress""). "
1327,4," We note that on September 13, 1994, President Clinton signed into law the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 
1994, Pub. L. 103-322, 108 Stat. 1796. Section 320904 of that Act, id., at 2125, amends § 922(q) to include congressional 
findings regarding the effects of firearm possession in and around schools upon interstate and foreign commerce. The 
Government does not rely upon these subsequent findings as a substitute for the absence of findings in the first instance. Tr. of 
Oral Arg. 25 (""We're not relying on them in the strict sense of the word, but we think that at a very minimum they indicate that 
reasons can be identified for why Congress wanted to regulate this particular activity""). "
1337,1, All references to The Federalist are to the Jacob E. Cooke 1961 edition.
1337,2," Even to speak of ""the Commerce Clause"" perhaps obscures the actual scope of that Clause. As an original matter, Congress 
did not have authority to regulate all commerce; Congress could only ""regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the 
several States, and with the Indian Tribes."" U.S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 3. Although the precise line between interstate/foreign "
1338,," commerce and purely intrastate commerce was hard to draw, the Court attempted to adhere to such a line for the first 150 years 
of our Nation. See infra, at 593-599."
1338,3," There are other powers granted to Congress outside of Art. I, § 8, that may become wholly superfluous as well due to our 
distortion of the Commerce Clause. For instance, Congress has plenary power over the District of Columbia and the territories. 
See U.S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 17, and Art. IV, § 3, cl. 2. The grant of comprehensive legislative power over certain areas of the 
Nation, when read in conjunction with the rest of the Constitution, further confirms that Congress was not ceded plenary 
authority over the whole Nation. "
1339,4," Cf. 3 Debates 40 (E. Pendleton at the Virginia convention) (The proposed Federal Government ""does not intermeddle with the 
local, particular affairs of the states. Can Congress legislate for the state of Virginia? Can [it] make a law altering the form of 
transferring property, or the rule of descents, in Virginia?""); id., at 553 (J. Marshall at the Virginia convention) (denying that 
Congress could make ""laws affecting the mode of transferring property, or contracts, or claims, between citizens of the same 
state""); The Federalist No. 33, at 206 (A. Hamilton) (denying that Congress could change laws of descent or could pre-empt a 
land tax); A Native of Virginia: Observations upon the Proposed Plan of Federal Government, Apr. 2, 1788, in 9 Documentary 
History 692 (States have sole authority over ""rules of property""). "
1341,5," None of the other Commerce Clause opinions during Chief Justice Marshall's tenure, which concerned the ""dormant"" 
Commerce Clause, even suggested that Congress had authority over all matters substantially affecting commerce. See Brown v. 
Maryland, 25 U.S. 419, 12 Wheat. 419, 6 L. Ed. 678 (1827); Willson v. Black Bird Creek Marsh Co., 2 Pet. 245 (1829). "
1342,6," It is worth noting that Congress, in the first federal criminal Act, did not establish nationwide prohibitions against murder and the 
like. See Act of Apr. 30, 1790, ch. 9, 1 Stat. 112. To be sure, Congress outlawed murder, manslaughter, maiming, and larceny, 
but only when those acts were either committed on United States territory not part of a State or on the high seas. Ibid. See U.S. 
Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 10 (authorizing Congress to outlaw piracy and felonies on high seas); Art. IV, § 3, cl. 2 (plenary authority 
over United States territory and property). When Congress did enact nationwide criminal laws, it acted pursuant to direct grants 
of authority found in the Constitution. Compare Act of Apr. 30, 1790, supra, §§ 1 and 14 (prohibitions against treason and the 
counterfeiting of U.S. securities), with U.S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 6 (counterfeiting); Art. III, § 3, cl. 2 (treason). Notwithstanding 
any substantial effects that murder, kidnaping, or gun possession might have had on interstate commerce, Congress understood 
that it could not establish nationwide prohibitions. Likewise, there were no laws in the early Congresses that regulated manufacturing and agriculture. Nor was there any statute 
that purported to regulate activities with ""substantial effects"" on interstate commerce. "
1343,7," To be sure, congressional power pursuant to the Commerce Clause was alternatively described less narrowly or more narrowly 
during this 150-year period. Compare United States v. Coombs, 12 Pet. 72, 78 (1838) (commerce power ""extends to such acts, 
done on land, which interfere with, obstruct, or prevent the due exercise of the power to regulate [interstate and international] 
commerce"" such as stealing goods from a beached ship), with United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U.S. 1, 13, 39 L. Ed. 325, 
15 S. Ct. 249 (1895) (""Contracts to buy, sell, or exchange goods to be transported among the several States, the transportation 
and its instrumentalities . . . may be regulated, but this is because they form part of interstate trade or commerce""). During this 
period, however, this Court never held that Congress could regulate everything that substantially affects commerce. "
1344,8," Although I might be willing to return to the original understanding, I recognize that many believe that it is too late in the day to 
undertake a fundamental reexamination of the past 60 years. Consideration of stare decisis and reliance interests may convince 
us that we cannot wipe the slate clean."
1344,9," Nor can the majority's opinion fairly be compared to Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 49 L. Ed. 937, 25 S. Ct. 539 (1905). 
See post, at 604-609 (SOUTER, J., dissenting). Unlike Lochner and our more recent ""substantive due process"" cases, to-day's 
decision enforces only the Constitution and not ""judicial policy judgments."" See post, at 607. Notwithstanding JUSTICE 
SOUTER's discussion, ""'commercial' character"" is not only a natural but an inevitable ""ground of Commerce Clause distinction."" 
See post, at 608 (emphasis added). Our invalidation of the Gun-Free School Zones Act therefore falls comfortably within our 
proper role in reviewing federal legislation to determine if it exceeds congressional authority as defined by the Constitution itself. 
As John Marshall put it: ""If [Congress] were to make a law not warranted by any of the powers enumerated, it would be 
considered by the judges as an infringement of the Constitution which they are to guard . . . . They would declare it void."" 3 
Debates 553 (before the Virginia ratifying convention); see also The Federalist No. 44, at 305 (J. Madison) (asserting that if 
Congress exercises powers ""not warranted by [the Constitution's] true meaning"" the judiciary will defend the Constitution); id., 
No. 78, at 526 (A. Hamilton) (asserting that the ""courts of justice are to be considered as the bulwarks of a limited constitution 
against legislative encroachments""). Where, as here, there is a case or controversy, there can be no ""misstep,"" post, at 614, in 
enforcing the Constitution. "
1345,*," Indeed, there is evidence that firearm manufacturers -- aided by a federal grant -- are specifically targeting schoolchildren as 
consumers by distributing, at schools, hunting-related videos styled ""educational materials for grades four through 12,"" Herbert, 
Reading, Writing, Reloading, N. Y. Times, Dec. 14, 1994, p. A23, col. 1."
1345,1," In this case, no question has been raised about means and ends; the only issue is about the effect of school zone guns on 
commerce. "
1349,2," Unlike the Court, (perhaps), I would see no reason not to consider Congress's findings, insofar as they might be helpful in 
reviewing the challenge to this statute, even though adopted in later legislation. See the Violent Crime Control and Law 
Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-322, § 320904, 108 Stat. 2125 (""The occurrence of violent crime in school zones has 
resulted in a decline in the quality of education in our country; . . . this decline . . . has an adverse impact on interstate commerce 
and the foreign commerce of the United States; . . . Congress has power, under the interstate commerce clause and other 
provisions of the Constitution, to enact measures to ensure the integrity and safety of the Nation's schools by enactment of this 
subsection""). The findings, however, go no further than expressing what is obviously implicit in the substantive legislation, at 
such a conclusory level of generality as to add virtually nothing to the record. The Solicitor General certainly exercised sound 
judgment in placing no significant reliance on these particular afterthoughts. Tr. of Oral Arg. 24-25. "
1371,1," Paragraph 25 of the complaint alleges: Defendant Red Top, pursuant to the District of Columbia Taxicab Commission's Office Administrative Order No. 4, is not 
licensed to pick up any passenger in the District of Columbia except under the following conditions: a) in response to a 
radio call to a ""Virginia dispatcher, transmitted to the Virginia cab - to pick up in the District of Columbia with a direct 
destination in [Arlington County];"" or b) in ""response to a prearranged trip for a party to go from the District of Columbia to a 
direct destination in [Arlington County];"" or c) in the event that ""immediately following the termination of a trip into the 
District of Columbia from Virginia, the Virginia taxicab may pickup [sic] a passenger bound for the Virginia county of 
licensure [Arlington County] provided the pick-up is at the exact location that the original Virginia passenger was 
discharged."" D.C. Taxicab Commission Office Administrative Order No. 4 (August 13, 1987) at 1-2. Paragraph 32 is identical to paragraph 25, except that the allegations in that paragraph relate to Barwood and reference 
Maryland and Montgomery County."
1371,2," If the complaint fails to state a claim under the Sherman Antitrust Act, it also fails to state a claim under the District of Columbia 
Unfair Trade Practices Act, D.C. Code § 28-4508. See Mazanderan v. Independent Taxi Owners' Ass'n, Inc., 700 F. Supp. 588, 
591 & n.9 (D.D.C. 1988). "
1381,1," Rule 5.6 provides A lawyer shall not participate in offering or making: (a) a partnership or employment agreement that restricts the rights of a lawyer to practice after termination of the 
relationship, except an agreement concerning benefits upon retirement; or (b) an agreement in which a restriction on the lawyer's right to practice is part of the settlement of a controversy between 
private parties. "
1395,1," We note that, pursuant to the Stipulated Protective Order entered by the court on June 8, 1994, the parties have filed most of 
their briefs and exhibits regarding this motion under seal. In accordance with the strong presumption of public access to judicial 
records described in Pansy v. Borough of Stroudsburg, 23 F.3d 772 (3d Cir. 1994) and Leucadia, Inc. v. Applied Extrusion 
Technologies, Inc., 998 F.2d 157, 161-64 (3d Cir. 1993), we find that there is nothing in this opinion which would warrant 
denying full public access to its text. "
1400,2," 1. We assume that Pennsylvania law applies to these Pennsylvania parties, in this federal question action involving 
Pennsylvania corporations and agents. "
1402,3," We note that a ""professional review action"" may itself include some element of fact-finding or investigation, as for example, 
where a hearing is held which results in a change in a physician's privileges. See Fobbs v. Holy Cross Health Sys. Corp., 789 F. 
Supp. at 1065 (""The professional review action/decision is borne of the investigative process and may entail a secondary level of 
additional, more narrowed investigation as needed based on information discovered during the initial investigation."") "
1405,4," In fact, he concedes that the Board relied exclusively on the reports of the Rothacker Committee and Dr. Wilson as conveyed 
to the Board by Dr. Hoke and Mr. Young. "
1406,5," Moreover, the fact that defendants have submitted three more expert reports concurring with Dr. Wilson would cast serious 
doubt on any such assertion. "
1408,6," The section states, in relevant part, that the following requirements must be met: (1) Notice of proposed action -- The physician has been given notice stating -- (A)(i) that a professional review action has been proposed to be taken against the physician, (ii) reasons for the proposed action, (B)(i) that the physician has the right to request a hearing on the proposed action, (ii) any time limit (of not less than 30 days) within which to request such a hearing, and (C) a summary of the rights in the hearing under paragraph (3)."
1408,42, U.S.C. § 11112(b)(1). 
1409,7," Plaintiff also argues that defendants conspired to restrict his ability to operate a Spine Center in competition with defendants. 
However, he does not address this claim separately in his briefs, but appears to rely on the same set of facts presented in 
support of his arguments regarding the peer review investigation and privilege restriction at LGH. Accordingly, we also will not 
address this claim separately. "

1412,9," The Third Circuit has cautioned that ""a court should not tightly compartmentalize the evidence put forward by the nonmovant, 
but instead should analyze it as a whole to see if together it supports an inference of concerted action."" Petruzzi's IGA, 998 F.2d 
at 1230 (citing Big Apple BMW, 974 F.2d at 1364). "
1413,10," Plaintiff also points to considerable evidence of an anticompetitive motive on the part of Dr. Rothacker. For example, he 
alleges that Dr. Rothacker intentionally hijacked the original peer review of Dr. Kent and redirected it at Dr. Mathews. He also 
contends that Dr. Rothacker withheld favorable information. Plaintiff's brief repeatedly states, however, that these and other 
actions of Dr. Rothacker were unilateral and without the knowledge of other defendants. Accordingly, we find that this evidence 
cannot provide a basis for plaintiff's claim that Dr. Rothacker participated in a conspiracy to deny plaintiff's privileges."
1413,11," See, e.g., Weiss v. York Hosp., 745 F.2d at 821 n.60 (""By restricting staff privileges to doctors who have achieved a 
predetermined level of medical competence, a hospital will enhance its reputation and the quality of care that it delivers.""); see 
also BCB Anesthesia Care, Ltd. v. Passavant Memorial Area Hosp. Ass'n, 36 F.3d 664, 667 (7th Cir. 1994)(""A hospital has an 
unquestioned right to exercise some control over the identity and number to whom it accords staff privileges"") (citing Jefferson 
Parish Hosp. v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 30, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 (1989)); Oksanen v. Page Memorial Hosp., 945 F.2d at 
709 (""The peer review process, by policing the competence and conduct of doctors, can enhance competition.""); HCQIA, 42 
U.S.C. § 11101 (reporting Congress' finding that effective peer review can ""restrict the ability of incompetent physicians to move 
from State to State without disclosure of the physician's previous damaging or incompetent performance""). "
1414,12," Of course we recognize, as the Third Circuit recently reiterated, that the summary judgment standard is no different in an 
antitrust case than in any other case and that the Supreme Court's decision in Matsushita merely reiterated the requirement that 
a party's inferences be reasonable in order to reach the jury. See Advo, Inc. v. Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc., 51 F.3d 1191, 
1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 8595, No. 94-1812, 1994 WL 218046 at * 4 (3d Cir. April 14, 1995). "
1415,13," See, e.g., Weiss v. York Hosp., 745 F.2d at 815-816 (explaining that ""a single entity made up of independent, competing 
economic entities satisfies the joint action requirement of Sherman Act, section 1"")."
1415,14," See Nanavati v. Burdette Tomlin Hosp., 857 F.2d 96, 119 (3d Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1078, 109 S. Ct. 1528, 103 L. 
Ed. 2d 834 (1989) (noting that ""a group is a combination as a matter of law only for the actions it takes as a group"")."
1415,15," The causal chain is especially attenuated given the intervening Wilson report, upon which the Board apparently placed great 
emphasis in its decisionmaking process."
1415,16," Defendants have also claimed that LGH and the individual physician defendants are incapable of conspiring as a matter of 
law, to which plaintiff responds that the doctors have individual economic interests separate from those of the hospital which 
render them capable of conspiring with one another. Because of our holding, we do not reach this argument. "
1419,17," 28 U.S.C. § 1367 codified the common law abstention doctrines and reads in relevant part: (c) The district courts may decline 
to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim . . . if . . . (3) the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has 
original jurisdiction."
1419,18, This dismissal is of course without prejudice to plaintiff's right to present his claims in state court. 
1435,1," The Associated Hardware case seems to be of little relevance to the case at bar. In that case, the seller and buyer never 
signed a contract. Rather, there was an offer and a counteroffer, and then a series of deliveries and invoices based upon the 
terms in the seller's offer. The court decided that the seller's offer contained the terms of the contract. Associated Hardware, 355 
F.2d at 120. In the case at bar, the parties signed a contract. This makes the Associated Hardware case distinguishable "
1436,," because there was no classic meeting of the minds at a definable moment, but rather the need to interpret the actions of the 
individuals over the course of performance."
1436,2," General Auto is more on point than Associated Hardware. In that case, the buyer and seller had an agreement under which the 
selling price of cars was fixed in a written agreement. 40 A.2d at 768. Subsequently, the buyer repeatedly protested that it was 
being overcharged and requested itemized accounts. Id. at 769. The seller's reply to this request was that ""if [buyer was] 
dissatisfied with the terms [it] could cease to do business, yet the [buyer] continued to purchase automobiles from the [seller] in 
very large numbers."" Id. The General Auto court affirmed the trial court's determination that neither party followed the terms of 
the contract, essentially that the contract was never followed, and that buyer had no right to attempt to enforce the pricing terms 
found in the contract for this reason. Id. at 769-70. The usefulness of General Auto is limited by the fact that it is both a 
Connecticut and pre-Code case. "
1462,1," LECs are the entities which provide telephone service within a local calling region, and which provide most telephone 
customers with their physical connection to the telephone network."
1462,2," A customer wishing to make a long distance telephone call from a payphone always has the option of selecting a long distance 
carrier by dialing a 10XXX access code (or an 800 number). Only if the customer fails to do this does the long distance carrier 
selected by the COCOT owner provide the service. "
1463,3," That is, calls made from other numbers cannot, at the request of the caller, be billed to a number having ""billed-number 
screening."""
1463,4," Many pay telephones are located on private property, the owners of which receive a commission in return for allowing the 
phones to be placed on that property. "
1467,5," In Massachusetts, two such LATAs were designated, corresponding to the eastern and western portions of the Commonwealth."
1467,6," See, e.g. MCI, DPU 1655/84-124 (1984); GTE Sprint, DPU 84-12/84-157 (1984); Satellite Business Systems, DPU 84-125/84-
148 (1984); Western Union, DPU 84-24/84-119 (1984); TDX, DPU 84-231/84-243 (1985). "
1468,7," The Federal Communications Commission defines resale ""to be an activity wherein one entity subscribes to the 
communications services and facilities of another entity and then re-offers communications services to the public … for profit."" 
Regulatory Policies Concerning Resale and Shared Use of Common Carrier Services and Facilities, 60 F.C.C.2d 261, 271 
(1976)."
1468,8," COCOT operators are resellers since they buy phone service from NET and resell it to individual customers who use their 
phones. "
1469,9," While it is true that the DPU has approved a tariff which requires NET to provide a PAL line (rather than a coin line) to COCOT 
owners, this is not evidence of a DPU policy against providing a higher level of service to COCOT owners if, in fact, it is feasible. 
I find nothing in the DPU administrative record to suggest that the DPU ever seriously considered the question of permitting or 
requiring NET to offer coin-line service to COCOT owners. In the absence of such a determination by DPU, I cannot conclude 
that NET is merely following DPU policy by refusing to offer such a service. "
1470,10," In Ticor, 112 S. Ct. at 2179, the Supreme Court specifically rejected the reasoning in New England Motor Rate Bureau which 
suggested that the mere theoretical power of state officials to regulate some activity was sufficient to satisfy the ""active 
supervision"" prong of Midcal. "
1472,11," Of course if there came a time when NET's ""dominant carrier"" status were to change, these conclusions would need to be 
reconsidered. "
1473,12," Were it difficult to determine state policy, such policy would not be ""clearly articulated."""
1473,13," I am, of course, aware of NET's unique status as the dominant LEC in Massachusetts, and of the significant impact that the 
outcome of this litigation could have on the development of telecommunications markets in the Commonwealth. However, that 
fact does not alter my conclusions here. If the DPU believes that maintenance of the status quo is necessary for the orderly 
introduction of new technology into Massachusetts, it remains fully empowered to issue orders mandating that NET continue its 
current practices as a matter of policy. "
1474,14," Of course, once the FCC has made a determination that a rate or practice is reasonable (by approving a tariff incorporating 
such rate or practice), the courts are fully competent to award relief pursuant to such rule or practice. See, e.g. MCI 
Telecommunications Corp. v. Ameri-Tel, Inc., 852 F. Supp. 659, 666 (N.D.Ill. 1994)."
1474,15," There is also some question as to whether IMR has stated a claim under the Communications Act of 1934. This Act is 
inapplicable to intrastate communications service, 47 U.S.C. § 152(b), or to telephone exchange service. 47 U.S.C. § 221(b). "
1475,," These areas are regulated by the DPU. The crux of IMR's complaints, however, are that NET discriminated against it in the 
provision of local exchange service, namely by providing inferior line access and insufficient central office blocking services to 
COCOT customers. These complaints would appear to be solely within the jurisdiction of state law regulators. NET has not 
pressed this point, however, and since I find that the FCC has primary jurisdiction of these complaints to the extent they are 
governed by federal law, I need not pursue the matter further. "
1476,16," To the extent that NET had a contractual duty to prevent fraudulent calls, the failure to comply with this duty does not 
constitute a tort. Rather, it suggests nothing more than a breach of contract, one which IMR has not alleged. See Bay State-
Spray, 404 Mass. at 107. "
1477,17," NET also argues that IMR's common law claims are preempted by the state and federal laws regulating telecommunications. 
Because I find that IMR has failed to state a claim under any of the common law counts, I need not address this issue. "
1478,18," Such a code would alert ATT of the fact that the call was being made from a restricted phone and would permit ATT, if it so 
chose, to refuse to put the call through."
1478,19," IMR served its request on April 2, 1991."
1478,20," The FCC has recently announced that it is considering the adoption of new rules which would limit the liability of COCOT 
operators for fraudulent calls under certain circumstances. See In re Policies and Rules Concerning Toll Fraud, 8 F.C.C.R. 8618 
(1993) at PP 27-31. Because such rules were not in force at the time the disputed calls were made, and can only apply 
prospectively, they are irrelevant to the analysis here. See AT&T Co. v. FCC, 978 F.2d 727, 732 (D.C.Cir. 1992) cert. den. 113 
S. Ct. 3020 (1993); MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. Ameri-Tel, Inc., 852 F. Supp. 659, 663 (N.D.Ill. 1994). "
1479,21," The FCC's interpretation must be accorded great weight by this Court. See F.C.C. v. WNCN Listeners Guild, 450 U.S. 582, 
598, 67 L. Ed. 2d 521, 101 S. Ct. 1266 (1981) (""The construction of a statute by those charged with its execution should be 
followed unless there are compelling indications that it is wrong.""); New York City Human Resources Administration, 833 F. 
Supp. at 971. See also AT&T v. United Artists Payphone Corp., 1990 WL 200653 (S.D.N.Y. 1990) (referring case of first 
impression involving liability of COCOT owner for fraudulent calls to FCC under doctrine of primary jurisdiction). "
1480,22," In particular, IMR has not explained why ATT had any duty to act to prevent such fraud. ATT's duty to IMR is governed by the 
mandatory terms of ATT's filed tariffs. See Ivy Broadcasting Co. v. AT&T, 391 F.2d 486, 491-492 (2d Cir. 1968); AT&T v. 
Florida-Texas Freight, Inc., 357 F. Supp. 977 (S.D.Fla. 1973) aff'd 485 F.2d 1390 (5th Cir. 1973); Marco Supply Co. v. AT&T 
Communications, 875 F.2d 434, 436 (4th Cir. 1989); MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. TCI Mail, Inc., 772 F. Supp. 64, 66-67 
(D.R.I. 1991). Cf. Maislin Indus. U.S., Inc. v. Primary Steel, Inc., 497 U.S. 116, 126, 111 L. Ed. 2d 94, 110 S. Ct. 2759 (1990) 
(under Interstate Commerce Act ""the rights defined by the tariff cannot be enlarged by either contract or tort of the carrier…. This 
stringent rule prevails because otherwise the paramount purpose of Congress--prevention of unjust discrimination--might be 
defeated.""); United States v. Associated Air Transport, Inc., 275 F.2d 827, 832-833 (5th Cir. 1960) (tariff filed with Civil 
Aeronautics Board was the ""sole standard for services to be rendered and charges assessed and collected""); Atchison, T. & S.F. 
Ry. Co. v. Springer, 172 F.2d 346, 349-350 (7th Cir. 1949); Jarka Corp. of Baltimore v. Penn. R.R. Co., 130 F.2d 804 (4th Cir. 
1942). It is undisputed, however, that ATT's tariff did not require (or even permit) the type of call screening or call blocking services to 
which IMR claims to have been entitled. Thus, failure to provide such screening or blocking could not constitute a breach of 
ATT's duty to IMR, and is thus not a bar to recovery. Jiffy Lube, 813 F. Supp. at 1169; New York City Human Resource 
Administration, 833 F. Supp. at 977; Chartways, 8 F.C.C.R. 5601 at P 16."
1480,23," In addition to the areas discussed above, IMR seeks to conduct additional discovery of facts concerning ""remaining affirmative 
defenses, including violations of the Communications Act of 1934 and the Federal antitrust laws."" This request is denied 
because IMR has not satisfied the Paterson-Leitch requirements that it demonstrate the existence of such facts, that it show that 
they had a realistic prospect of obtaining them from ATT, and that it show how they are material to its defense."
1480,24," Count IX alleges unfair competition, in breach of M.G.L. ch. 93A. Count X alleges Tortious Interference with Contractual 
Relationships. Count XI alleges ""Violation of Duty of Due Care and Gross Negligence."" "
1481,25," The requirements under the Massachusetts Antitrust Act, M.G.L. ch. 93, are identical. C.R. Bard, Inc. v. Medical Electronics 
Corp., 529 F. Supp. 1382, 1391 (D.Mass. 1982)."
1481,26," ""Today, the only serious candidates for this label are price (or output) fixing agreements and certain group boycotts or 
concerted refusals to deal."" U.S. Healthcare, Inc. v. Healthsource, Inc., 986 F.2d 589, 593 (1st Cir. 1993). "
1482,27," IMR bases its claim that ATT possesses market power on the allegation that ATT controls 90% of the ""pay phone long 
distance market"" in Massachusetts. This allegation is of dubious significance. The FCC has found that the market for long 
distance business services (of which service to COCOT owners is a part), is ""substantially competitive"", In re Competition in the 
Interstate Interexchange Marketplace, 6 F.C.C.R. 5880 at P 36 (1991), and IMR has provided no basis to treat the market for 
long distance services to pay telephones (or COCOTs) as distinct from this larger market. Moreover, even leaving aside the question of whether the ""pay phone long distance market"" is a meaningful construct, the mere 
allegation of high market share is insufficient to support IMR's claim of market power. Market share ""is just a way of estimating 
market power, which is the ultimate consideration."" Ball Memorial Hosp. v. Mutual Hosp. Ins., Inc., 784 F.2d 1325, 1336 (7th Cir. 
1986). If an examination of the market shows that, in fact, there are no barriers to competition, the market share presumption is 
negated. Id. See also U.S. v. Syufy Enters., 712 F. Supp. 1386 (N.D. Cal. 1989) aff'd 903 F.2d 659 (9th Cir. 1990) (showing that 
theater operator had 84.1 percent of gross box office receipts for first-run films in relevant market did not establish monopoly 
power because entry barriers in market were very low); Bacchus Indus. v. Arvin Indus., 939 F.2d 887, 894 (10th Cir. 1991) (with 
lower entry barriers and many small firms in market, no ""dangerous probability"" of monopoly notwithstanding defendant's 55 to 
60 percent market share). Here, IMR's own allegations show that it was not constrained by market power because it was able to switch to a supplier which 
provided it with what it demanded, at a competitive price. See U.S. v. AT&T Co., 552 F. Supp. 131, 170-172 (D.D.C. 1982) "
1483,," (describing why ATT was unlikely to have market power after equal access rules were implemented, notwithstanding its high 
market share). Thus, any implication of market power from ATT's market share is rebutted by IMR's own factual claims."
1483,28," In AT&T v. Eastern Pay Phones, 767 F. Supp. 1335, 1338-1339 (E.D.Va. 1991), the court refused to dismiss antitrust counts 
against ATT which were based on allegations similar to those raised in this action. In Eastern, a COCOT owner, which had not 
pre-subscribed to ATT, alleged that ATT, by failing to block fraudulent calls routed through ATT from the COCOT owner's pay 
phones, was attempting to drive non-ATT subscribing pay phones out of business. ATT moved to dismiss the claim on the 
ground that the COCOT owner had failed to allege injury from anti-competitive conduct. The court refused to dismiss, reasoning 
that AT&T's alleged conduct was anti-competitive, and any injury arising therefrom was antitrust injury cognizable under the 
antitrust laws. The Eastern court, however, never addressed the question of whether ATT had the market power to inflict antitrust injury on the 
COCOT owner. Moreover, the facts in Eastern are distinguishable from those here because the COCOT owner in Eastern was 
not an ATT customer. Rather, it was a customer of one of ATT's competitors and ATT's allegedly anti-competitive conduct did 
not arise from the COCOT owner's customer relation with AT&T. Thus there was never a question of whether the COCOT owner 
could switch long-distance carriers to avoid ATT's practices. For these reasons, I do not find Eastern to be persuasive authority 
on the question of whether IMR suffered an antitrust injury in this case. "
1484,29," IMR fails to explain how this last claim could conceivably constitute an unfair or deceptive practice within the meaning of ch. 
93A. "
1502,1," Realty One originally filed three counterclaims against ""Re/Max"" and ""its independent franchisee co-conspirators."" (Docket 9). 
All seven of these original plaintiffs filed their joint reply to Realty One's counterclaims several days before the amended 
complaint permitted four of those plaintiffs to participate (Docket 12). By separate motion of March 9, 1994, Plaintiffs moved for 
judgment on the pleadings or in the alternative for summary judgment with respect to Realty One's counterclaims (Dockets 17 & 
18). Due to the early timing of Plaintiffs' alternative motion for summary judgment, however, the Court granted Realty One leave 
until August 15, 1994 to respond (Docket 26). Instead of responding to Plaintiffs' motions, Realty One moved to amend its counterclaims on July 18, 1994 (Docket 48). After 
considering the positions of the parties, the Court allowed Realty One to amend its counterclaims as of August 19, 1994 (Docket 
61) rendering much of Plaintiffs' motion for judgment on the pleadings moot as prematurely filed. See Order of August 19, 1994, 
slip op. at 2 (Docket 60). Because of the amendment, the Court allowed Plaintiffs and Realty One additional time to supplement 
their positions on Plaintiffs' dispositive motions. Id. at 2-3. Initially, Plaintiffs did not file a formal reply to Realty One's amended counterclaims, Fed. R. Civ. P. 7(a), 12(a)(2) & 15(a); but 
they did file a supplemental memorandum in support requesting that Realty One's amended counterclaims be dismissed in their 
entirety or that summary judgment be granted (Docket 81). With leave of court, Plaintiffs filed their reply on March 15, 1995 
(Docket 145). Realty One filed its supplemental memorandum in opposition to plaintiffs' motions on November 4, 1994 (Docket 
90). Plaintiffs filed their reply on November 23, 1994 (Docket 103). The Court granted Realty One the opportunity to file a "
1503,," rebuttal which was done on December 6, 1994 (Docket 107). Plaintiffs filed their sur-reply on December 12, 1994 (Docket 110); 
thus bringing the motions at issue after the passage of almost nine months. "
1505,2," HN7[
] Section 1 of the Sherman Act condemns ""every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations . . . ."" as illegal. 15 U.S.C. § 1. HN8[
] Section 2 provides that ""every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, 
shall be deemed guilty of a felony . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 2."
1505,3," HN9[
] At the summary judgment stage or at trial, the inquiry turns from the allegations to the evidence. At that time, proof of 
antitrust injury which is necessary to prove a party's standing to bring a private cause of action blurs with proof of the substantive 
elements of the underlying offense itself. Failure to prove either antitrust injury or standing would result in judgment for the 
defendant as a matter of law. Compare Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 582-98, 106 S. Ct. 
1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (after concluding that several of respondents' allegations did not state a claim for antitrust injury, 
the Court analyzed respondents' remaining claim of antitrust injury in the summary judgment context) with Associated Gen. 
Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 524-26 & 545-46, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 
723 (1983) (affirming the district court's dismissal of plaintiff as without standing to sue under Clayton Act § 4 based on the 
allegations contained in the amended complaint). "
1506,4," The distinction between a party's standing and the validity of his or her alleged cause of action under the antitrust laws is subtle 
but important. In Brunswick plaintiff claimed the breach of substantive rights guaranteed under the antimerger provisions of 
Clayton Act § 7, 15 U.S.C. § 18. 429 U.S. at 480. After trial, the defendants appealed an adverse judgment by questioning 
whether antitrust damages were available where the sole injury resulted from mergers that kept competitors in business.  Id. at 
484. The Court noted that Clayton Act § 4, 15 U.S.C. § 15, differs from § 7 in that § 4 is ""primarily,"" but not exclusively, a remedy 
provision. See id. at 486. Significantly, the Court read a substantive requirement into private causes of action seeking damages 
by virtue of § 4 which goes beyond mere proof that plaintiff sustained ""injury causally linked to an illegal presence in the market."" 
Id. at 489. As the Court stated, ""to recover damages respondents must prove more than that petitioner violated § 7, since such proof 
establishes that injury may result."" Id. at 486 (emphasis added). That ""additional proof"" requirement originated from the Court's 
reading of § 4 to provide relief only for injuries of ""'the type that the statue was intended to forestall.'"" See id. at 487-88 (quoting 
Wyandotte Co. v. United States, 389 U.S. 191, 202, 88 S. Ct. 379, 19 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1967) which held that criminal penalties for 
negligently sinking a ship were not exclusive and that a civil negligence action would be implied ""because the interest of the 
plaintiffs . . . fell within the class that the statute was intended to protect, and because the harm that had occurred was of the 
type that the statute was intended to forestall[.]""). Significantly, the Brunswick Court granted judgment notwithstanding the 
verdict holding that plaintiffs did not prove a claim at trial upon which relief could be granted. 429 U.S. at 490. Nowhere did the 
Court imply that the competitor bowling alleys were not proper parties to bring their Clayton Act § 7 antimerger suit. Thus apart 
from a party's standing to sue under the Associated General Contractors test, infra, a party will fail to state an antitrust cause of 
action whenever it fails to satisfy the two-pronged ""antitrust injury"" test enunciated in Brunswick, See 429 U.S. at 489."
1506,5," See also Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 582-86, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) 
(finding that plaintiff did state a claim for antitrust injury arising from an alleged conspiracy to monopolize the American market 
through predatory pricing under § 1 of the Sherman Act, but that plaintiff failed to state an antitrust claim for injuries arising from 
the cartelization of a foreign market, agreements to charge higher than competitive prices, or conspiracies to impose nonprice 
restraints that raise the price or limit the output of defendants' products). "
1507,6," Compare also Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 111 & n. 6, 107 S. Ct. 484, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1986) 
(applying the antitrust injury concept to Clayton Act § 16 but stating that the standing analysis under § 16 will not always be 
identical to the standing analysis under § 4). "
1508,7," ""To determine that question the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is 
applied; its condition before and after the restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The 
history of the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be 
attained, are all relevant facts."" Chicago Bd. of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 38 S. Ct. 242, 62 L. Ed. 683 (1918)."
1508,8," In those horizontal price-fixing cases where the per se rule applies, the only inquiry is whether there was an agreement to 
restrain trade, since the unreasonableness of the restraint is conclusively presumed regardless of whether the rule of reason 
would lead to a different result. Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Soc'y, 457 U.S. 332, 344, 102 S. Ct. 2466, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48

Hosp. of Mount Clemens, Mich., 964 F.2d 567, 568 (6th Cir. 1992) (citing White & White). The difference appears to be that the 
more abbreviated versions of the test refer in general to ""unreasonable"" restraints of trade, and thereby encompass both per se 
and rule-of-reason violations of § 1."
1509,10," The Supreme Court recently reiterated the anticompetitive purpose-or-effect rule in the disjunctive in Summit Health, Ltd. v. 
Pinhas, 500 U.S. 322, 330-31, 111 S. Ct. 1842, 114 L. Ed. 2d 366 (1991) with its quotation of McLain v. Real Estate Bd. of New 
Orleans, Inc., 444 U.S. 232, 243, 100 S. Ct. 502, 62 L. Ed. 2d 441 (1980). In those cases, however, the Court limited its use of 
that disjunctive rule to the interstate commerce question. The Court used that rule to support its alternative holding that 
""respondent need not allege, or prove, an actual effect on interstate commerce to support federal jurisdiction."" Summit Health. 
500 U.S. at 331. But the question of federal jurisdiction is separate from the question of whether the underlying claim which 
supports jurisdiction fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. E.g., Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 681-82, 66 S. Ct. 
773, 90 L. Ed. 939 (1946). Even the majority opinion in United States v. Container Corp., 393 U.S. 333, 337, 89 S. Ct. 510, 21 L. 
Ed. 2d 526 (1969) which has been cited in support of the disjunctive rule actually rested its holding on the fact that ""the 
inferences [were] irresistible that the exchange of price information . . . had an anticompetitive effect in the industry, chilling the 
vigor of price competition."" Id. (emphasis added). "
1510,11," In Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 73 S. Ct. 872, 97 L. Ed. 1277 (1953) the Supreme Court 
found the Government's proof insufficient to support a § 1 conviction because ""the Government . . . [had] proved neither actual 
unlawful effects nor facts which radiate a potential for future harm."" Id. at 622. The Eleventh Circuit has read the Times-Picayune 
language as an alternative to its § 1 effects test. U.S. Anchor Mfg., Inc. v. Rule Indus., Inc., 7 F.3d 986, 1001 (11th Cir. 1993). In 
light of the Supreme Court's recent statement that ""proper [§ 1] analysis focuses, not upon actual consequences, but rather upon 
the potential harm that would ensue if the conspiracy were successful,"" Summit Health, Ltd. v. Pinhas, 500 U.S. 322, 330, 111 S. 
Ct. 1842, 114 L. Ed. 2d 366 (1991), the Times-Picayune alternative would appear to be legitimate substitute to proof of 
anticompetitive effect in the appropriate case. Compare also Lie v. St. Joseph Hosp. of Mount Clemens, Mich., 964 F.2d 567, 
570 (6th Cir. 1992) (section 1 action could not be sustained where plaintiff had not pled or suggested that he can show a naked 
restraint or an actual detrimental effect on competition flowing from the suspension of his staff privileges""); Dunn & Mavis, Inc. v. 
Nu-Car Driveaway, Inc., 691 F.2d 241, 245 (6th Cir. 1982) (""Since the complaint does not allege facts suggesting that 
[defendant's] refusal to deal had any significant anti-competitive effect on the market, there is no rule of reason case alleged.""); 
Greater Rockford Energy & Technology Corp. v. Shell Oil Co., 998 F.2d 391, 396 (7th Cir. 1993) (""[A] plaintiff, to show a [§ 1] 
violation, must establish a contract, conspiracy or combination intended to restrain competition and which actually has an 
anticompetitive effect."") (citations omitted). "
1511,12," The Supreme Court in United States v. Kissel, 218 U.S. 601, 31 S. Ct. 124, 54 L. Ed. 1168 (1910) addressed the sufficiency of 
allegations that defendants engaged in an unlawful conspiracy to restrain the trade in refined sugar among the several States 
from December 30, 1903 to July 1, 1909. The Court rejected defendants' ""special plea in bar"" defense which challenged the 
sufficiency of the indictment as written on statute of limitations grounds. Even though the initial agreement may have been made 
more than three years before the date of the indictment, ""the overt acts relied upon coming down to within three years of the 
indictment [were] alleged to have been done in pursuance of the conspiracy . .;"" and thus were sufficient to charge a continuing 
conspiracy within the limitations period which could not be defeated by the special plea. Id. at 609-10. It thus appears that the 
Summit Health Court cited Kissel for a proposition for which it does not stand. If the essence of a § 1 violation was the illegal 
agreement itself and that was the basis of the Kissel Court's holding, then the defendant's special plea in bar defense should 
have prevailed. The Summit Health Court arguably should have cited the later case of Nash v. United States, 229 U.S. 373, 378, 
33 S. Ct. 780, 57 L. Ed. 1232 (1913) for the proposition that an antitrust conspiracy can be based on an agreement alone. "
1512,13," Some courts and commentators have read a conspiracy to monopolize claim to require proof of an overt act. This precedent 
appears to be contrary to the holding of Nash v. United States, 229 U.S. 373, 378, 33 S. Ct. 780, 57 L. Ed. 1232 (1913) which 
seems to apply equally to a § 2 conspiracy. For cases requiring an overt act for a conspiracy to monopolize see U.S. Anchor 
Mfg., Inc. v. Rule Indus., Inc., 7 F.3d 986, 1001 (11th Cir. 1993); TV Communications Network, Inc. v. Turner Network 
Television, Inc., 964 F.2d 1022, 1026 (10th Cir. 1992); Baxley-Delamar Monuments, Inc. v. American Cemetery Ass'n, 843 F.2d 
1154, 1157 (8th Cir. 1988); Great Escape, Inc. v. Union City Body Co., Inc., 791 F.2d 532, 540-41 & n. 4 (7th Cir. 1986) (noting 
that Kinter, Federal Antitrust Law 434 (1980) does not list the overt act as a requirement for a conspiracy to monopolize claim); 
North Mississippi Communications, Inc. v. Jones, 792 F.2d 1330, 1335 (5th Cir. 1986); Volvo North Am. Corp. v. Men's Int'l 
Professional Tennis Council, 857 F.2d 55, 74 (2d Cir. 1988); James R. Loftis, et al., Antitrust Law Developments 145 (2d ed. 
1984). Other courts have questioned whether proof of a specific intent to monopolize is necessary for proof of a § 2 conspiracy. See 
Syufy Enters. American Multicinema, Inc. 793 F.2d 990, 1000-01 (9th Cir. 1986), cert. denied 479 U.S. 1031, 107 S. Ct. 876, 93 
L. Ed. 2d 830 (1987) (questioning the specific intent requirement but holding that a judgment n.o.v. should have been granted in 
any event where there was no evidence that more than one of the alleged co-conspirators had some awareness that the 
underlying conduct was anticompetitive or monopolistic) (citing United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 U.S. 131, 146-47, 
68 S. Ct. 915, 92 L. Ed. 1260 (1948) for the proposition that a § 1 conspiracy merely requires proof of acquiescence in conduct 
with knowledge that it was anticompetitive). "
1516,14," In Goldfarb Court treated the bar associations' price-fixing agreements as unlawful under § 1, but refrained from enunciating a 
per se  rule applicable to all agreements among bar associations and their members only because the professional nature of the 
business of law ""may require that a particular practice, which could properly be viewed as a violation of the Sherman Act in 
another context, be treated differently."" 421 U.S. at 788-89 n. 17. See also FTC v. Indiana Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 458-
61, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1986) (Court would not extend per se group boycott analysis to horizontal agreements 
among members of a professional association to withhold from their customers a particular service)."
1516,15," ""A manufacturer of course generally has a right to deal, or refuse to deal, with whomever it likes, as long as it does so 
independently."" Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 761, 104 S. Ct. 1464, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1984) (citing 
United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300, 307, 39 S. Ct. 465, 63 L. Ed. 992 (1919); United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., 362 
U.S. 29, 80 S. Ct. 503, 4 L. Ed. 2d 505 (1960)). But there are exceptions to this general rule. Unilateral refusals to deal for the 
purpose of acquiring or preserving monopoly power are unlawful. See Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 377-
79, 93 S. Ct. 1022, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1973); Lorain Journal v. United States, 342 U.S. 143, 155, 72 S. Ct. 181, 96 L. Ed. 162 
(1951); Byars v. Bluff City News Co., Inc., 609 F.2d 843, 854-62 (6th Cir. 1979). Thus, ""[a] refusal to deal does not become 
illegal under the Sherman Act unless 'it produces an unreasonable restraint of trade, such as price fixing, elimination of 
competition or the creation of a monopoly.'"" Crane & Shovel Sales Corp. v. Bucyrus-Erie Co., 854 F.2d 802 (6th Cir. 1988) 
(quoting from the court below quoting Ace Beer Distributors, Inc. v. Kohn, 318 F.2d 283, 287 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 
922, 84 S. Ct. 267, 11 L. Ed. 2d 166 (1963)). When evaluating unilateral refusals to deal, the court must appreciate the 
elements of monopolization and attempted monopolization claims which may be used to challenge those refusals. ""The offense 
of monopoly under § 2 of the Sherman Act consists of two elements: (1) the possession of monopoly power in the relevant 
market and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a "
1517,," consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident."" United States v. Grinnell Co., 384 U.S. 563, 570-71, 
86 S. Ct. 1698, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1966). The offense of attempted monopolization requires a showing of a specific intent to 
monopolize, anti-competitive conduct, and a dangerous probability of success for achieving monopoly power. E.g., Tarrant Serv. 
Agency, Inc. v. American Standard, Inc., 12 F.3d 609, 615 (6th Cir. 1993), cert. denied,     U.S.    , 114 S. Ct. 2709, 129 L. Ed. 
2d 836 (1994)."
1517,16," Vertical refusals to deal to enforce nonprice vertical restraints such as exclusive dealing arrangements have been subject to 
the rule of reason analysis. Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 299 F.2d 839, 842 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 371 
U.S. 861, 83 S. Ct. 118, 9 L. Ed. 2d 99 (1962); Theee Movies of Tarzana v. Pacific Theatres, Inc., 828 F.2d 1395, 1398 (9th Cir. 
1987). "
1521,17," Essentially, Realty One and Smythe Cramer invite the Court to read paragraph 14 out of the First Amended Complaint. Realty 
One acknowledges that the recruitment of real estate brokers can constitute a relevant market, but argues that the parties do not 
compete in that market. Post-hearing Br. in Supp. at 2-3, Docket 154. Smythe Cramer also denies that any of the parties in this 
case could participate in such a market unless they ""engaged in that activity for a living."" which, according to Smythe Cramer, 
none do. Supplemental Mem. in Supp. at 9-10, Docket 157. Obviously, Re/Max Int'l thinks to the contrary and has so alleged in 
its First Amended Complaint. One may put Re/Max Int'l to its proof, but without citation of case law to the contrary, the Court 
concludes that the ability to allege the conceptual space in which competition takes place in order to frame one's antitrust 
allegations is uniquely within the power of the plaintiff."
1521,18," A year later, the Supreme Court brought together the remoteness analysis begun in McCready with the announcement of the 
balancing-of-factors test for antitrust standing in Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. California State Council of 
Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983). See McCready, 457 U.S. at 476 n. 12 (noting that it had 
been unnecessary to a resolution of the case to adopt any particular standing approach to the ""problem of remote antitrust 
injury""). Compare also 457 U.S. at 491 (""It may be that the Court today is merely holding that a boycottee has 'standing' to sue 
under § 4."") (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). "
1524,19," The question reserved by Associated General Contractors in note 44 for cases where a direct victim of a boycott fails to suffer 
a type of injury related to antitrust policy is not presented here as Re/Max Int'l has introduced evidence that its suffers antitrust 
injury. Unlike the question reserved by the Associated General Contractors Court, here the question properly framed would be 
whether a direct victim of a boycott who suffers a type of injury related  to antitrust policy, but who is not an immediate victim, 
may recover damages when the ultimate purpose of the boycott is to restrain competition in the relevant economic market. 
Compare 459 U.S. at 541 n. 44."
1524,20," The Court agrees with the point made by Smythe Cramer that the market ""participant"" discussed in Associated General 
Contractors and Southaven is a synonym for a market ""competitor"". See Supplemental Mem., Docket 157 at 3-4. This Court 
simply does not agree that whether one is a market participant/competitor or a consumer describes the class of all ""persons"" 
who can qualify for antitrust standing under § 4 of the Clayton Act under the balancing-of-factors approach. "
1527,21," Even if the Court were to find that the third factor favored a grant of standing, the second and fifth factors would still 
predominate under the circumstances of this case. "
1535,1," Under the Interstate Commerce Act, motor carriers fall into two defined categories: motor common carriers and motor contract 
carriers: § 10102. Definitions HN2[
] In this subtitle -- (14) ""motor common carrier"" means a person holding itself out to the general public to provide motor vehicle transportation 
for compensation over regular or irregular routes, or both. (15) ""motor contract carrier"" means -- (A) a person, other than a motor common carrier, providing motor vehicle transportation of passengers for compensation 
under continuing agreements with a person or a limited number of persons (i) by assigning motor vehicles for a continuing period of time for the exclusive use of each such person; or (ii) designed to meet the distinct needs of each such person; and (B) a person providing motor vehicle transportation of property for compensation under continuing agreements with one or 
more persons-- (i) by assigning motor vehicles for a continuing period of time for the exclusive use of each such person; or "
1536,, (ii) designed to meet the distinct needs of each such person.
1536,49," U.S.C. § 10102(14),(15)."
1536,2," The Act defines ""control"" in pertinent part as ""actual control, legal control, and the power to exercise control, through or by (A) 
common directors, officers, stockholders, a voting trust, or a holding or investment company, or (B) any other means."" 49 U.S.C. 
§ 10102(7)."
1536,3," The Act aims to recognize and preserve the inherent advantages of various modes of transportation; promote safe, economical 
and efficient transportation; encourage sound economic conditions among carriers; encourage the establishment and 
maintenance of reasonable rates without unreasonable discrimination or unfair or destructive competitive practices; coordinate 
federal and state efforts on transportation matters; and encourage fair wages and working conditions in the transportation 
industry.  49 U.S.C. § 10101."
1536,4," The seven shares of stock that Bethlehem Steel did not own were issued in the name of the Railroad's current officers, and 
could not be sold or transferred. Whenever the Railroad replaced an officer, the stock was reissued in the new officer's name. "
1537,5," In July, 1988, Bethran ceased motor carrier operations. "
1538,6," Finding genuine issues of disputed fact, the district court denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment as to the 
promissory estoppel claim.  Siegel Transfer, Inc. v. Carrier Express, Inc., 856 F. Supp. 990, 1007-08 (E.D. Pa. 1994). On August 
22, 1994, a stipulation and order dismissing this claim without prejudice was entered. "
1541,7," The courts have not only applied Copperweld in cases involving de minimus deviations from 100% ownership, but have also 
extended its principles to situations where parental ownership was in the 80% to 91.9% range. Stephen Calkins, Copperweld in 
the Courts: The Road to Caribe, 63 Antitrust L.J. 345, 351-41 (1995) (reviewing and commenting on the several categories of 
judicial treatment of Copperweld)."
1541,8," The plaintiffs argue that the mere fact that Bethlehem Steel did not wholly own the Railroad requires that we reject Copperweld 
Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984), and instead, seek guidance from 
the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U.S. 218, 91 L. Ed. 2010, 67 S. Ct. 1560 (1947). In 
Copperweld, the Supreme Court suggested that Yellow Cab may stand ""for a narrow rule based on the original illegality of the 
affiliation"" between a parent and its subsidiary. 467 U.S. at 762 n. 6. Even this ""narrow rule"" does not apply: the plaintiffs did not 
challenge Bethlehem Steel's original acquisition of Bethran and Carrier Express on antitrust grounds; nor do they challenge it 
here. We note, also, that the Interstate Commerce Commission's order exempting the original acquisition from regulation 
immunized it from the antitrust laws. See supra, page 5."
1541,9," The defendants correctly point out that Bethlehem Steel ultimately determined who held the seven shares it did not own. Since 
the Railroad was a Pennsylvania corporation, under Pennsylvania's corporation law, Bethlehem Steel, as the Railroad's 
controlling shareholder, selected the Railroad's directors. The directors, in turn, appointed the Railroad's officers, in whose 
names the seven shares were issued. 15 Pa. C.S.A. §§ 1502(a)(16), 1721, 1725(a). "
1542,10," The plaintiffs further maintain that Copperweld is rendered inapplicable by a commitment in the petition Bethlehem Steel and 
the Railroad filed with the Commission to operate Bethran and Carrier Express separately, and by the Commission's order 
granting the petition on the ""specifically-stated condition"" of separate operation. Not only is the plaintiffs' characterization of the 
petition and the Commission's order plainly incorrect, but more importantly, under Copperweld, the control a parent corporation 
exercises over its subsidiary is relevant, not whether a parent operates the subsidiary separately. "
1543,11," The plaintiffs do not allege that Rediehs Express itself, through Thomas Rediehs, Kermit Bryan or any other person, 
participated in this alleged restraint. They contend only that by virtue of Rediehs' and Bryan's respective interests in Rediehs 
Express, Oak Management was a separate entity with separate interests, capable of conspiring with Carrier Express."
1543,12," In Copperweld, the Supreme Court observed without comment that ""many courts have created an exception for corporate 
officers acting on their own behalf."" 467 U.S. at 769-70 n.15, citing, inter alia, Johnston v. Baker, 445 F.2d 424 (3d Cir. 1971)."
1543,13," In Weiss v. York Hospital, 745 F.2d 786 (3d Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1060, 84 L. Ed. 2d 836, 105 S. Ct. 1777 (1985), 
we noted the exception but did not have occasion to discuss it. Id. at n.43. We again noted the exception in Tunis Bros. Co. v. 
Ford Motor Co., 763 F.2d 1482, 1496-97 (3d Cir. 1985), vacated and remanded, 475 U.S. 1105 (1986), reinstated, 823 F.2d 49 
(1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1060 (1988), but because the factual issues relating to the exception were unresolved, we 
remanded the case to the district court for trial without analyzing the exception further. "
1544,14," In his antitrust treatise, Professor Phillip E. Areeda opines that the exception should, as a general proposition, only capture an 
employee's pursuit of an outside interest which competes with the plaintiff. To do otherwise, Professor Areeda maintains, would 
be unwise given the varied personal interests that may motivate employees to act for themselves. 7 PHILLIP E. AREEDA, 
ANTITRUST LAW § 1471e2 & n.27 (1986). Professor Areeda also states that if an employee cannot cause the employer to engage in the restraint, an independent interest 
on his part is largely irrelevant to an antitrust analysis: The employee's ""personal stake"" bears on antitrust policy, if at all, only if it brings about an alleged restraint by his employer 
that would not otherwise have occurred. The employer's self-interest may have been insufficient to induce the alleged 
restraint in the absence of the ""conspiring"" employee's independent interest. The employee's independent interest is simply 
irrelevant to an employer act that would have occurred without regard to it. Thus, the premise for finding an employer-employee conspiracy is that an employee's personal stake causes the employer 
to adopt a restraint that would not otherwise have been adopted by the employer in his own self-interest. Id. at § 1471d1. "
1545,15," The record shows that Rediehs advised Carrier Express not to terminate its contract with Siegel Transfer, and that Bryan did 
not offer any advice one way or the other. "
1546,16," Section 11704 permits an interested person to enjoin an abandonment of service; section 11705 provides a private right of 
action to one injured in specified ways by certain carriers; section 11707 permits a private action against a common carrier for 
liability under receipts and bills of lading; and section 11708 allows a person to sue to enforce the Act's provisions relating to the 
issuance of operating certificates and permits.  49 U.S.C. §§ 11704-11705, 11707-11708. We note also that the plaintiffs did not raise the question of an implied right of action under either the Interstate Commerce Act or 
the Elkins Act. "
1547,17," The district court analyzed the civil conspiracy claim under Pennsylvania law. On appeal, both parties applied Pennsylvania 
law to this claim."
1547,18," The contract's termination provision provided: (13) This AGREEMENT is to become effective January 4, 1986 and shall remain in effect for a period of three yrs from such 
date, and from year to year thereafter, subject to the right of either party hereto to cancel or terminate the AGREEMENT at 
any time upon not less than thirty (30) days written notice of one party to the other. (emphasis in original)."
1547,19," The district court determined that Maryland law applies to the plaintiffs' contract claims. Neither party disagreed with the court's 
choice of law on appeal."
1547,20," The plaintiffs' additional claim that the contract was not a ""trip lease"" and their discussion regarding the necessary elements of 
a motor carrier agreement under the Interstate Commerce Act are not relevant, and do not alter the fact that the defendants 
properly exercised the termination right they had under the contract. "
1554,1," On March 24, 1995, plaintiff filed an amended complaint in which it dropped its Fifth Claim for relief for alleged Civil Rights 
violations. Therefore, this opinion will not address that claim. The parties agreed by letter that the motion to dismiss would go to 
the amended complaint without the necessity of filing a new motion. "
1556,2," These findings of the ALJ of infringement were not adopted in the final determination by the ITC. The ITC took no position on 
this findings. "
1557,3," Defendants raise the issue that Noerr-Pennington immunity may act as a bar to plaintiff's state common law claims. The 
Second Circuit, while declining to rule on this issue, has suggested that the First Amendment underpinnings of Noerr-Pennington 
mean that Noerr-Pennington immunity should extend to causes of action, including state statutory unfair competition and 
common-law claims, other than federal antitrust claims. Suburban Restoration Co., Inc. v. ACMAT Corp., 700 F.2d 98, 101 (2d 
Cir. 1983). However, because plaintiff's common law claims are deficient on other grounds, this court need not address this 
issue. "
