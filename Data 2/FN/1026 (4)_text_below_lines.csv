32,1," Before the Commission, Philips argued that section 271(d)(5) abolished the doctrine of per se patent misuse as applied to tying 
arrangements. In making that argument, Philips relied heavily on the legislative history of the 1988 Act that adopted section 
271(d)(5). Because Philips has not renewed that argument in this court, we do not address it, although we note that the 
legislative history cited by Philips before the Commission indicates congressional skepticism about treating tying arrangements 
in the context of patent licensing as per se patent misuse, rather than analyzing such arrangements under the rule of reason. 
See 134 Cong. Rec. 32,294-95 (1988) (statement of Rep. Kastenmeier); id. at 32,471 (statement of Sen. DeConcini); id. at 
32,471-72 (statement of Sen. Leahy). "
33,2," The Commission argues that the Supreme Court's later decision in Automatic Radio Co. v. Hazeltine, 339 U.S. 827, 94 L. Ed. 
1312, 70 S. Ct. 894, 1950 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 608 (1950), supports its broad interpretation of the Paramount case because the 
Supreme Court in Automatic Radio characterized Paramount as having ""condemned"" an arrangement ""conditioning the granting 
of a license under one patent upon the acceptance of another and different license."" Id. at 830-31. We do not, however, interpret 
that shorthand characterization of Paramount as effecting a broadening of the holding of the earlier case and an extension of its 
rationale to a class of cases far beyond Paramount's facts. "
35,3," The effect of a nonexclusive license was different before the Supreme Court, in Lear, Inc. v. Adkins, 395 U.S. 653, 23 L. Ed. 2d 
610, 89 S. Ct. 1902 (1969), abolished the patent doctrine of licensee estoppel. HN10[
] Before Lear, a nonexclusive license 
had a legal effect that made it more than a mere covenant by the licensee not to sue. Acceptance of the license barred the 
licensee from challenging the validity of the patent. Some of the early decisions regarding patent-to-patent tying arrangements 
appear to have been based, at least in part, on that feature of pre-Lear patent licenses. See, e.g., Am. Securit Co. v. 
Shatterproof Glass Corp., 268 F.2d 769, 777 (3d Cir. 1959); Int'l Mfg. Co. v. Landon, 336 F.2d 723, 731 (9th Cir. 1964); see also 
Duplan Corp. v. Deering Milliken, Inc., 444 F. Supp. 648, 699 (D.S.C. 1977), aff'd in pertinent part, 594 F.2d 979 (4th Cir. 1979). 
In the post-Lear era, the ""acceptance"" of a license has no such restrictive effect on the licensee's freedom."
35,4," Of course, in a tying case if the evidence shows that the price of a bundled product reflects any of the cost of the tied product, 
""customers are purchasing the tied product, even if it is touted as being free."" Multistate Legal Studies, Inc. v. Harcourt Brace 
Jovanovich Legal & Prof'l Publ'ns, Inc., 63 F.3d 1540, 1548 (10th Cir. 1995), citing 3 Phillip E. Areeda & Donald F. Turner, 
Antitrust Law P 733a (1978) (tying may exist ""when a machine is sold or leased at a price that covers 'free' servicing""); see also 
United States v. Microsoft Corp., 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330, 253 F.3d 34, 68 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (""the antitrust laws do not condemn 
even a monopolist for offering its product at an attractive price, and we therefore have no warrant to condemn Microsoft for "
36,," offering either IE or the IEAK free of charge""). The evidence in this case, however, does not indicate that there is a hidden 
charge for the so-called nonessential patents in the Philips patent packages."
36,5," The implication of the Commission's decision is that a party with both an essential patent and a nonessential patent is not 
allowed to package the two together and only offer the package for a single price. That would have the perverse effect of 
potentially putting a party owning both an essential patent and a nonessential but related patent in a worse position than a party 
owning only the essential patent. The party owning only the essential patent would be free to charge any licensing fee up to the 
maximum that a manufacturer would be willing to pay to practice the patented technology, while a party owning both the 
essential patent and a nonessential patent would be barred from extracting that maximum licensing fee for its essential patent 
and assuring the manufacturer that it would not be subject to suit on the nonessential patent. "
37,6," The Supreme Court recently granted certiorari in Independent Ink, Inc. v. Illinois Tool Works, Inc., 396 F.3d 1342 (Fed. Cir.), 
cert granted, 125 S. Ct. 2937 (2005), a case involving a tying arrangement involving a patent and an unpatented product. It is 
possible that the Supreme Court's decision in that case will offer some guidance with respect to the patent misuse issue 
presented by this case, but because the circumstances of the two cases are quite different, we have determined that the proper 
course is to resolve this appeal without waiting for the Supreme Court's decision in Independent Ink. "
38,7," The intervenors note that ""there existed a number of commercially-available CD-R discs utilizing alternative technology that did 
not infringe these supposedly essential patents."" For support, intervenors cite the opinion of the administrative law judge, who 
determined that two patents held by Taiyo Yuden were not essential. Because the Commission did not address those patents, 
however, they are not relevant to this appeal. "
39,8," In its amicus curiae brief, the New York Intellectual Property Association notes that, unlike the other three allegedly 
nonessential patents, the Iwasaki patent would expire after all of the undisputedly essential patents. As a result, the presence of 
the Iwasaki patent in a patent licensing package could have the effect of extending the obligation to pay royalties beyond the 
expiration date of the ""essential"" patents. A provision requiring that royalties be paid beyond the life of a patent has been held to 
be unenforceable. See Brulotte v. Thys Co., 379 U.S. 29, 30, 13 L. Ed. 2d 99, 85 S. Ct. 176 (1964). However, because neither 
the Commission nor the administrative law judge addressed the impact of that potential temporal extension of the royalty 
obligation, and none of the parties addressed that issue on appeal in their briefs, we do not address the issue here. "
45,1," Technically, Ahmanson says that the third prong should be the individual attorney's involvement in both the old and new cases. 
H.F. Ahmanson & Co. v. Salomon Brothers, Inc., 229 Cal. App. 3d 1445, 1457, 280 Cal. Rptr. 614 (Cal. Ct. App. 1991) (""The 
Nature and Extent of the Attorney's Involvement With the Cases""). However, the analysis only discusses the attorney's 
involvement in the previous matter. Later cases have interpreted the third Ahmanson factor as referring only to the attorney's 
involvement with the previous matter. See, e.g. Adams v. Aerojet-General Corp., 86 Cal. App. 4th 1324, 1332, 104 Cal. Rptr. 2d 
116 (Cal. Ct. App. 2001). The nature and extent of the attorney's involvement in the new case is not a factor of the substantial 
relationship test. This understanding of Ahmanson is consistent with the rule that disqualification of an attorney is automatically 
imputed to his/her law firm. "
48,2," The court notes that Texas standards on attorney disqualification are different than California standards. Texas uses the 
substantial relationship test in evaluating successive representations to address two fundamental concerns: ""a client's interest in 
preserving his confidential information. . . . [and] the client's interest in the loyalty of his attorney."" In re American Airlines, Inc., 
972 F.2d 605, 616 (5th Cir. 1992). In contrast, California courts have found that the substantial relationship test should only be 
used to address the issue of client confidentiality. ""Where the potential conflict is one that arises from the successive 
representation of clients with potentially adverse interests, the courts have recognized that the chief fiduciary value jeopardized 
is that of client confidentiality. . . . The primary value at stake in cases of simultaneous or dual representation is the attorney's 
duty -- and the client's legitimate expectation -- of loyalty, rather than confidentiality. . . . the substantial relationship test is 
founded on the need to protect against the improper use of client secrets . . . such a test does not set a sufficiently high standard 
by which the necessity for disqualification should be determined in cases involving dual representation."" Flatt v. Superior Court, 
9 Cal. 4th 275, 283-84, 36 Cal. Rptr. 2d 537, 885 P.2d 950 (Cal. 1994). In Texas, ""prior representations in which the attorney 
advised the client but received no confidential information"" warrants disqualification as the duty of loyalty is implicated. In re 
American Airlines, Inc., 972 F.2d 605, 619 (5th Cir. 1992). Under the same facts, disqualification would not be required in 
California. The extent to which enforcing the duty of loyalty was ultimately relied upon to disqualify the law firm in American 
Airlines is unclear as the Fifth Circuit found that the Texas version of the substantial relationship test fully addressed the 
concerns of loyalty. The court did go on to say as dicta, ""We believe that disqualification of [law firm] would be appropriate even 
under the relaxed actual prejudice' or taint' standard [only looking at client confidences] Northwest urges this court to adopt."" In 
re American Airlines, Inc., 972 F.2d 605, 619 (5th Cir. 1992) "

67,3," Thus in 1906, when Goldman, Sachs & Co. desired to enter the underwriting business and was unable to raise enough capital 
to do so, Henry Goldman convinced Philip Lehman to share the risk, and together Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Lehman Brothers 
obtained sufficient capital to finance United Cigar Manufacturers (later named the General Cigar Co.). See Morgan, 118 F. 
Supp. at 637. This partnership, which involved jointly purchasing security issues directly from issuers and equally dividing what 
profits they realized from the sale, allowed the two firms to finance other enterprises like Sears, Roebuck & Co. and B.F.

67,4,"  Typically, the principal underwriters will sign the firm-commitment underwriting agreement. These managers or principal 
underwriters in turn contact other broker-dealers to become members of the underwriting group who are to act as 
wholesalers of the securities to be offered. In many instances the securities distribution network will include the use of a 
selling group of other investment bankers or brokerage houses. Members of the selling group generally do not share the 
underwriters' risk and are thus retailers who are compensated with agents' or brokers' commission rather than by sharing in 
the underwriting fee. "

The Act was also amended to require that, before the SEC approve the imposition by exchanges of a system of fixed rates, the 
Commission first conclude that such a system ""did not impose any burden on competition … taking into consideration the 
competitive effects of permitting such … fixed rates."" Securities Exchange Act § 6(e)(1)(B) (as amended by the Securities Act 
Amendments of 1975, 89 Stat. at 108) (codified at 15 U.S.C. § 78f(e)(1)(B))."
78,27," This Court noted ""that the history of the Bank Merger Act evidenced a congressional intent not to immunize bank mergers from 
at least Sherman Act attack, whereas the 1934 Act entrusts the SEC with supervision of rate-fixing, a practice which outside the 
confines of the 1934 Act is a per se violation of the Sherman Act."" Id. at 1310-11 n.11 (citations omitted)."
78,28," Additionally, the Court noted that ""it seemed to us … that when something as crucial to the survival of the securities industry 
as its very ancient rate structure is at stake, diagnoses and changes must come from an agency with the Commission's 
expertise."" Id. at 1309. "
79,29," In a footnote, the Court explained that, although the SEC had never issued a formal order requiring fixed rates, its actions had 
""an effect equivalent to that of a formal order."" Id. at 689 n.13."
79,30,"  HN6[
] Courts have discerned two major types of antitrust conspiracies to restrain trade: horizontal and vertical. 
Horizontal conspiracies involve agreements among competitors at the same level of competition to restrain trade, such as 
agreements among manufacturers to fix prices for a given product and geographic market, or among distributors to fix 
prices for a given market. Vertical conspiracies, on the other hand, involve agreements between competitors at different 
levels of competition to restrain trade, such as agreements between a manufacturer and its distributors to exclude another 
distributor from a given product and geographic market. JLM Indus., Inc. v. Stolt-Nielsen SA, 387 F.3d 163, 179 (2d Cir. 2004) (quoting Crane & Shovel Sales Corp. v. Bucyrus-Erie 
Co., 854 F.2d 802, 805 (6th Cir. 1988))."
79,31," A conclusion to the contrary would have left broker-dealers with competing mandates. If they maintained a uniform price, they 
could violate antitrust laws, but if they did not, they could violate the Investment Company Act. The parties' concession comports 
with the second insight of the Gordon Court. "
80,32," See also Phonetele, 664 F.2d at 728 (""It is critical that the restraints so immunized were explicitly contemplated by statute."")."
80,33," The district court decision affirmed by the NASD Court found it ""apparent that Congress designed [section 22] to create and 
protect a primary distribution system which is repugnant to the antitrust laws and did so in complete recognition of the fact that 
the legislation would frustrate the growth of a free secondary market."" In re Mutual Fund Sales Antitrust Litig., 374 F. Supp. 95, 
109 (D.D.C. 1973), aff'd, United States v. National Ass'n of Sec. Dealers, Inc., 422 U.S. 694, 95 S. Ct. 2427, 45 L. Ed. 2d 486 
(1975). The Supreme Court substantially agreed. See NASD, 422 U.S. at 724. It explained that the Investment Company Act 
resulted from an intensive study of the mutual fund industry, id. at 705-06, in which ""the most prominently discussed 
characteristic [of the mutual-fund market] was the 'two-price system,' which [led to] an active secondary market under conditions 
that tolerated disruptive and discriminatory trading practices,"" id. at 706. The study revealed that ""the two-price system did not 
benefit the investing public generally,"" id. at 707, and that the system led to a ""bootleg market"" and price wars that disrupted the 
established offering prices of mutual funds, id. at 709. The Act ""was enacted with these abuses in mind."" Id. at 709. Moreover, 
section 22(f) of the Act, the subsection in which the Court found implied immunity, had been drafted by the SEC and considered 
by that agency as an ""authority necessary to allow regulatory control of industry measures designed to deal with the disruptive 
effects of 'bootleg market' trading and with other detrimental trading practices identified in the [study]."" Id. at 722. Funds were 
already imposing the challenged restrictions at the time that Congress passed the Act, see id. at 723, further suggesting that 
Congress was aware of and approved of the anticompetitive activity."
80,34," The Court noted that the SEC ""repeatedly had recognized the role of private agreements in the control of trading practices in 
the mutual-fund industry"" and had even ""looked to restrictive agreements similar to those challenged in the litigation [and] … at 
no point did it intimate that those agreements were not legitimate."" Nat'l Ass'n of Securities Dealers, 422 U.S. at 727 (footnote 
omitted). Indeed, historically, ""the Commission had allowed the industry to control the secondary market through contractual 
restrictions duly filed and publicly disclosed,"" and ""even the SEC's recently expressed intention to introduce an element of 
competition in brokered transactions reflected measured caution as to the possibly adverse impact of a totally unregulated and 
restrained brokerage market on the primary distribution system."" Id. at 728. "
81,35," As support, the Court relied in part on a footnote in a 1940 opinion by Justice Douglas that stated: The typical method adopted by Congress when it has lifted the ban of the Sherman Act is the scrutiny and approval of 
designated public representatives…. See the Maloney Act providing for the formation of associations of brokers and 
dealers with approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission and establishing continuous supervision by the 
Commission over specified activities of such associations. United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 227 n.60, 84 L. Ed. 1129, 60 S. Ct. 811 (1940) (citations omitted). "
82,36," In Verizon Communications Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 540 U.S. 398, 157 L. Ed. 2d 823, 124 S. Ct. 872 
(2004), however, the Supreme Court mentioned implied antitrust immunity, but only to note that such immunity was not available 
under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56, because that Act contained an antitrust-specific 
savings clause. See Verizon Communications, 540 U.S. at 406; see also Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, L.L.P. v. Bell Atl. Corp., 
305 F.3d 89, 109 (2d Cir. 2002), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Verizon Communs, Inc., 540 U.S. 398."
82,37,"  The [Federal Communications Act] provides for the regulation of telecommunications common carriers by the FCC and 
requires carriers to file tariffs with the FCC covering 'practices' as well as charges. Before changing any of its practices by 
filing a new tariff, the carrier must give ninety days notice to the FCC and the public. The requirement that carriers file tariffs 
is the primary mechanism of regulation. Once a tariff becomes effective, the carrier is required to adhere to its provisions. Phonetele, 664 F.2d at 721-22 (footnotes omitted). "
83,38," Flipping is the practice of reselling securities shortly after purchasing them in an IPO, Friedman, 313 F.3d at 797, that is, 
""buying a 'hot issue' and then selling it within a short period of time into a rising market, earning a quick profit on the 
transactions,"" In re Account Mgmt. Corp., Exchange Act Release No. 36,314, 60 S.E.C. Docket 962, 1995 WL 579449, at *2 n.3 
(Sept. 29, 1995). "
84,39," The Friedman court saw a direct analogy to NASD. See id. at 800 (""The facts in NASD are analogous to the case at bar ….""). 
This reference was appropriate because the second half of NASD dealt with a situation in which, inter alia, private individuals 
were charged with a conspiracy to engage in activities immunized by statute and permitted by SEC regulations. See National 
Ass'n of Securities Dealers, 422 U.S. at 733. NASD held that, although the SEC could not permit the agreements among 
competitors to impose restrictions on the secondary market, those agreements remained beyond the realm of antitrust law 
because their aim was actually encouraged by Commission policies. Id. at 733-35. Friedman is analogous. The SEC did not 
have the authority to authorize the horizontal agreements alleged in Friedman, but would, and did, permit the anticompetitive 
conduct that was the purpose of those agreements - the imposition of an anti-flipping stabilization scheme."
84,40," Our opinion also included a block quote from the NASD Court's discussion of a ""pervasive"" regulatory scheme. 317 F.3d at 
147 (quoting National Ass'n of Securities Dealers, 422 U.S. at 734-35). The characteristics of the SEC's review over the NASD 
that the Supreme Court termed ""pervasive"" in NASD were similar to characteristics of the exchanges at the time of In re Stock 
Exchange Options Trading Antitrust Litigation. See Harding v. Am. Stock Exch., Inc., 527 F.2d 1366, 1369 n.4 (5th Cir. 1976). 
We did not expressly note this similarity. "
86,41," From a purely textual standpoint, within the word ""permit"" lurks the danger of assuming away the entire immunity analysis. The 
word has two possible meanings, one purely descriptive and the other functional, stating a legal conclusion. As a descriptor, 
permit denotes an agency's act of express or silent approval of some course of conduct. This descriptive use is generally 
consistent with this Court's and the Supreme Court's use of the verb in precedent. See, e.g., National Ass'n of Securities 
Dealers, 422 U.S. at 729 (noting the SEC's authority ""to permit these and similar restrictive agreements""); Gordon, 422 U.S. at 
674 (""the SEC permitted amendment to allow competitive rates""); In re Stock Exchs. Options Trading Antitrust Litig., 317 F.3d at 
140 (describing SEC's consideration of whether ""to permit"" multiple options listings); Friedman, 313 F.3d at 799 (""The SEC has 
exercised its statutory authority in permitting - through the deliberate absence of regulation - defendants' conduct ….""). But the word ""permit"" - or its sister verbs ""authorize"" and ""allow"" - could also be understood as an equivalent to the verb 
""immunize"": to permit the conduct despite the antitrust laws. In this sense it states a legal conclusion - that the SEC immunizes 
the conduct. We disclaim that usage of the verb here, and we do so to prevent readers from attributing a legal conclusion to a 
mere recitation of fact. Our use of the word ""permit"" is thus limited to describing what actions an agency authorizes under its 
regulatory regime, not, as the ultimate issue may be, under the antitrust laws. Whatever the merits of an immunity doctrine in 
which agency permission is the endpoint of analysis - and precedent does not support that doctrine, see Otter Tail Power, 410 
U.S. at 371-76; Philadelphia Nat'l Bank, 374 U.S. at 321-33; Northeastern Tel. Co., 651 F.2d at 83-84 - we see no merit in 
harvesting legal principle from the empty wisdom of verbal imprecision."
86,42," The Friedman Court also noted that, soon after the passage of the Exchange Act, the SEC indicated its understanding that 
""anti-competitive practices were lawful in the absence of SEC regulation."" 313 F.3d at 802. We stated that, at that early date, 
""the agency was aware of the antitrust implications of stabilization practices and the potential for direct conflict."" Id. "
87,43," The Ninth Circuit has made the same insight. See Phonetele, 664 F.2d at 733 (""Where conduct is compelled by the regulatory 
agency, not implying antitrust immunity would be unfair to the regulated entity and would frustrate agency policies.""); cf. 1A 
AREEDA & HOVENKAMP, supra, at 35 (""Conduct that is specifically compelled by the agency acting within its jurisdiction is 
generally immune."")."
87,44," This was a guiding principle for the Supreme Court majority in Bob Jones University v. United States, 461 U.S. 574, 76 L. Ed. 
2d 157, 103 S. Ct. 2017 (1983). There, the Court held that the ""failure of Congress to modify [a series of] IRS ruling[s] …, of 
which Congress was, by its own studies and by public discourse, constantly reminded, and Congress' awareness of the [IRS 
policy] when enacting other and related legislation make out an unusually strong case of legislative acquiescence in and 
ratification by implication of the [IRS] rulings."" Id. at 599. The Court cautioned that ""nonaction by Congress is not often a useful 
guide,"" id. at 600, but explained that in some circumstances it is ""hardly conceivable that Congress … was not abundantly aware 
of what was going on,"" id. at 600-01. See id. at 607 (Powell, J., concurring). But see id. at 612 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) 
(""Regardless of our view on the propriety of Congress' failure to legislate we are not constitutionally empowered to act for 
them."")."
87,45," Although neither logically compelled nor universally true, it is probably fair to say that Congress is more likely to have 
contemplated repealing the antitrust laws with regard to anticompetitive conduct that at some point has been permitted by the 
SEC than conduct that has never been permitted. This inference flows from the fact that the concerns of an expert agency 
created by Congress are likely to share many of the concerns of the Congress that created it. Cf. NASD, 422 U.S. at 728. It has also been suggested that ""it would hardly be irrational for Congress to make antitrust immunity,"" at least in some 
circumstances, ""depend on whether an agency actively supervised the challenged conduct,"" 1A AREEDA & HOVENKAMP, 
supra, at 43; cf. Gordon, 422 U.S. at 691-62 (Douglas, J., concurring) (arguing that immunity is only appropriate where ""the SEC 
is actively and aggressively exercising its powers of review and approval""), but that is yet a more subtle implication. "
88,46," This list is merely an expansion on the one we provided in Northeastern Telephone Co. In that case, Judge Kaufman 
explained, HN15[
] ""Whenever claims of implied immunity are raised, they must be evaluated in terms of the particular 
regulatory provision involved, its legislative history, and the administrative authority exercised pursuant to it."" 651 F.2d at 83. The 
only gloss we add to this statement is a fleshing out of ""the particular regulatory provision involved"" - what we have deemed the 
second and third insights of Gordon. "
89,47," Defendants also argue that immunity is appropriate with regard to the allegations arising in the consolidated complaint 
because the complaint details a host of conduct recognized as legitimate by the SEC - in particular, the use of syndicates and 
the book-building process. According to defendants, ""If implied immunity were denied, plaintiffs would be free to attempt to 
establish their allegations of an unlawful conspiracy based on inferences from conduct that the SEC views as essential to capital 
formation."" Defendants, however, cite no legal support for their argument, which essentially posits that implied immunity should 
apply whenever the evidentiary basis for an antitrust claim includes legitimate activity. Defendants ask us to conclude that, 
where the securities laws do not imply the repeal of the antitrust laws with regard to particular illegitimate anticompetitive 
conduct, the conduct nonetheless might gain immunity based on the mode of proof. We see no basis for grounding the immunity 
analysis in evidentiary considerations; the immunity question, after all, is whether ""Congress has made a judgment that [certain] "
90,," restrictions on competition"" should be free from antitrust regulation. National Ass'n of Securities Dealers, 422 U.S. at 729. The 
answer to that question will not vary with different evidentiary strategies. We thus reject defendants' argument. In so doing, we 
leave to the district court the task of ensuring that defendants do not suffer prejudice from any evidence of their legitimate 
activities. "
91,48, The SEC prohibits tie-in arrangements under those general provisions. See supra note 10.

104,6," TorPharm, in fact, ""does not contend that its allegations of bad faith standing alone result in a waiver of SB's privilege or that

Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Hatch-Waxman Act, and the Patent Act. (Doc. No. 170 at 70.) However, HN9[
] as 
with the affirmative defense of good faith, merely averring that a party acted in compliance with the law does not automatically 
place advice of counsel at issue. See Cardtoons, L.C., 199 F.R.D. at 682. "
112,1," HN1[

112,2," The Affidavits of Gerald T. Walsh, Richard Taylor, Michael Domon, and Roberts Mahaney are attached to Defendant's Motion 
for Summary Judgment. (Docket No. 37)."
112,3," Defendant argues that Ms. Peterson's affidavit should be disregarded because it contradicts her prior deposition testimony. The 
Second Circuit has held that HN2[
] ""a party may not create an issue of fact by submitting an affidavit in opposition to a 
summary judgment motion that, by omission or addition, contradicts the affiant's previous deposition testimony."" Hayes v. New 
York City Dep't. of Corr., 84 F.3d 614, 619 (2d Cir. 1996). The reasoning behind this rule is straightforward -- ""if a party who has "
113,," been examined at length on deposition could raise an issue of fact simply by submitting an affidavit contradicting his own prior 
testimony, this would greatly diminish the utility of summary judgment as a procedure for screening out sham issues of fact."" Id. 
While this Court agrees that Ms. Peterson's affidavit does contradict her deposition testimony with respect to shipping and back 
orders, and the incidence of complaints made by Campbell's customers compared with other customers, Austin has cited to no 
such inconsistency with respect to unit pricing. Accordingly, this Court finds that the issue of whether Austin raised unit prices 
across the board is a disputed fact."
113,4," In support of its Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendant filed a memorandum of law, affidavits by Gerald T. Walsh, Richard 
Taylor, Michael Domon, and Roberts Mahaney with exhibits, a Local Rule 56 statement with an appendix thereto, a reply 
memorandum of law, and a second affidavit by Gerald T. Walsh with exhibits. Plaintiff filed a memorandum of law, affidavits by 
Douglas Campbell and Heather Peterson, and a Local Rule 56 statement with exhibits in opposition to the Motion. "
114,5," Specifically, Campbell argues that in response to his competitor's complaints, Austin employed unduly aggressive tactics in an 
effort to coerce him to adhere to a favorite pricing policy. Campbell disputes Austin's contention that it terminated him because 
he failed to comply with Austin's Internet MAP policy. He contends that Austin fired him for selling Austin products for below the 
suggested retail price rather than for advertising or failing to advertise at or above Austin's Advertising Price Schedule. "
115,6," With respect to the Colgate doctrine, the Monsanto Court held that: On a claim of concerted price fixing, the antitrust plaintiff must present evidence sufficient to carry its burden of proving that 
there was such an agreement. If an inference of such an agreement may be drawn from highly ambiguous evidence, there 
is a considerable danger that the doctrines enunciated in Sylvania and Colgate will be seriously eroded. Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 763. The Sylvania doctrine states that HN13[
] a court may not construe a non-price restriction imposed 
by a manufacturer on a distributor as illegal per se; rather, the restriction is to be judged under the ""rule of reason."" Continental 
T.V. Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 49-50, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 2557, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977). Under the rule of reason, ""the 
factfinder weighs all of the circumstances of a case in deciding whether a restrictive practice should be prohibited as imposing 
an unreasonable restraint on competition."" Id.; see also Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 
735-36, 108 S. Ct. 1515, 1525, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1988) (holding that even when an anti-trust plaintiff can prove a vertical 
agreement between a manufacturer and a full price dealer to terminate a competing price-cutting dealership, the agreement is 
not per se illegal under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, unless the plaintiff also offers proof of an agreement by the full price 
dealer to set its price at some level). In the instant case, Campbell disputes that he was terminated for violating Austin's Internet 
MAP policy set forth in the Agreement. Rather, he contends that the conspiracy between Austin and his competitors to fix prices 
existed outside of the Agreement. As such, this Court's analysis does not focus on the Agreement itself. For the record, however, this Court finds that the Agreement does not impose an unreasonable restraint on competition under 
the ""rule of reason"" set forth in Sylvania. 433 U.S. at 57-59. By its plain language, Austin's Internet MAP policy restricts only the 
minimum price for which a dealer could advertise on the Internet. (Domon Aff., Exh. A, P4(f)). With respect to actual sales 
pricing, the Agreement explicitly states that a dealer may sell Austin Air Cleaners for any price. (Domon Aff., Exh. A, P3(f)). As 
such, this Court finds that the Agreement itself does not violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act, nor does it constitute proof of a 
vertical agreement to fix prices. "
116,7," Plaintiff makes reference to a phone message left by Austin's representative Dan Block, in which he allegedly threatened to 
suspend Campbell if he did not comply with the suggested retail price. However, Plaintiff has not produced this tape and his 
allegations regarding the substance of the tape are contradicted by Mr. Block's sworn testimony that he told Campbell that he 
could sell the products for ""whatever he wanted to,"" but he had to comply with Austin's MAP policy. (Block Dep., pp. 15-16 
(attached as Ex. B to second Walsh Aff.). It is well settled that HN15[

evidence in ruling on a motion for summary judgment. Nora Beverages v. Perrier Group of Am., Inc., 164 F.3d 736, 746 (2d Cir. 
1998). Accordingly, this Court declines to consider Plaintiff's unsubstantiated (and disputed) allegations regarding the substance 
of Mr. Block's phone message. "
118,8," Moreover, it is not this Court's duty or function to search the record in support of a litigant's suggested arguments. See

124,3," As federal jurisdiction is lacking, the state law breach of contract claims will be dismissed without prejudice and no comment is 
required as to those claims. However, it is noted that plaintiff also declined to attach the contract relevant to the Sixth cause of 
action alleging breach a contract against the Hillside defendants. The Hillside defendants claim to have no knowledge of that 
contract. In response to defendants' statement, plaintiff notes only that defendants have not cited a case or rule for the 
proposition that the contract must be attached to the complaint. This response sullies the spirit of liberal pleading requirements 
of Fed. R. Civ. P. 8 and taps the resources and patience of all involved in the litigation."
124,4," As noted above, jurisdiction will be declined over the state law claims and thus plaintiffs' Second cause of action for breach of 
contract will be dismissed. It is noted however that it suffers from the same deficiency as the copyright claim because it is based 
on allegations that state defendants acted beyond a durational limitation: (1) ""The contract provided that DFY to reproduce (sic) 
such written and audio visual materials for the benefit of its trainers and staff for a period of one year commencing on the date of 
training and ending on the training's one year anniversary."" (Complaint at P51.); (2) ""The contract also provided that DFY 
trainers could train DFY staff in Plaintiff's program for a period of one year commencing on the date of training and ending on the "
125,," training's one year anniversary."" (Complaint at P52.); and, (3) defendant has continued to reproduce the materials and continued 
to train staff beyond the one-year limitation (Complaint at PP52, 53.)"
125,5," The Seventh cause of action never mentions the Hillside defendants. The Eighth cause of action simply lists them as 
conspirators. There are simply no allegations to support plaintiff's claims that the Hillside defendants participated in 
monopolization or conspiracy to monopolize the relevant market. Those claims are therefore subject to dismissal regardless of 
plaintiff's other pleading deficiencies. Heart Disease Research Foundation v. General Motors Corp., 463 F.2d 98, 100 (2d Cir.

Application, P224(b) (2002). Despite the intuitive sense that OCFS acts as the state itself, it is not ipso facto entitled to state 
immunity. ""The issue must ultimately depend on whether the sovereign power of the state is so involved in the organization and 
operation of the entity as to directly implicate the fundamental policy of federalism secured by the Eleventh Amendment."" Daniel 
v. Am. Bd. of Emergency Med., 988 F. Supp. 127, 153 (W.D.N.Y. 1997) (citations omitted.) The court [must] assess whether the entity constitutes an arm of a state by evaluating the degree of control and supervision 
over the entity, including the state's power of appointment and removal of officers or directors, any authority to approve or 
disapprove the actions of the entity, including its capacity to raise revenue for its own purposes, whether the entity is 
financially independent from the state, whether the state is responsible for the entity's obligations and liabilities, and the 
character of its functions, i.e., state-wide or local, are performed or served by the entity. Id. at 151-152. The state defendants point to legislation granting OCFS extensive regulatory power, the fact that the Governor appoints the 
commissioners of OCFS and DSS, and cite Automated Salvage Transport, Inc. v. Wheelabrator Env'tl Sys., 155 F.3d 59, 70 (2d 
Cir. 1998) and Hess v. Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corp., 513 U.S. 30, 61, 115 S. Ct. 394, 130 L. Ed. 2d 245 (1994), in arguing 
for immunity. A broad legislative grant of extensive regulatory power is not an obviously controlling factor. OCFS's powers do not seem more 
extensive than the home rule powers of municipalities, and those entities are not immune on that ground. Neither Hess or 
Wheelabrator offer much guidance. OCFS is clearly different from the bi-state agency operating a commuter railroad between 
states and the solid waste authority that maintains a vast system of solid waste management projects that were at issue in Hess 
and Wheelabrator. The nature of the activity is different, as is the extent of both government control and agency accountability to 
the public."
126,9," ""When a state agency, municipality, or other state subdivision claims state immunity from federal law, it must first identify a 
'clearly expressed state policy' that authorizes its actions."" Cine 42nd Street Theater Corp. v. Nederlander Organization, Inc., 
790 F.2d 1032, 1043 (2d Cir. 1986) (quoting Hallie, 105 S.Ct. at 1717). ""The clarity of such policy is often a function of how 
broadly the legislation is drawn, with the existence of such policy being more readily discernible in narrowly drawn legislation. 
The legislation must contain an affirmative showing of intent, though it need do no more than authorize the challenged conduct."" "
127,," Id. (quoting Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference v. United States, 471 U.S. 48, 105 S.Ct. 1721, 1729, 85 L. Ed. 2d 36 
(1985)). As related above, OCFS is charged with broad powers of operation and regulation which have allegedly had anticompetive 
effects. An ""adequate state mandate for anticompetitive activities . . . exists when it is found 'from the authority given a 
governmental entity to operate in a particular area, that the [state] legislature contemplated the kind of action complained of.'"" 
Wheelabrator, 155 F.3d at 69. (citations omitted). In areas of zoning, economic development or regulation of commercial entities in regional areas to solve environmental 
problems, it is easy to infer that exercise of the agency's mandate will result in displacement of competitors. Here, under a plain 
reading, the legislation reveals the state's concern, and subsequent policy, that child care providers receive sufficient training in 
restraint techniques. While it may easily be inferred that the state is neutral or indifferent to the means by which this is 
accomplished, it is not the sort of mandate which leads to an inference that the state intends to trump federal antitrust policy. "

137,4," Dr. Umbeck reached this conclusion by analyzing the DTW prices of Shell, Mobil, BP/Amoco, and Chevron in the Fort 
Lauderdale area from 2000 to 2004. He found that Shell's average DTW price ""is typically neither the highest nor the lowest 
price, but rather 'in the range' among the DTW prices charged by the major brands retailers in the Fort Lauderdale area."" 
(Umbeck Decl. at 3-4.) Dr. Umbeck also analyzed the actual DTW prices charged to the Lakes Shell and Turnpike Shell. He 
found that ""except for a few months in late 2002, when Shell was among the highest and a few months in 2003 and 2004, when 
Shell was the lowest, the charts indicate that the specific DTW prices for these stations were 'in the range' charged by other 
major brand retailers in the Fort Lauderdale area."" (Id. at 4.) "
138,5," Plaintiffs have objected, however, that Motiva failed to disclose the details of its zone area pricing system in discovery and 
instead brought them up for the first time in conjunction with its motion for summary judgment. The record, however, indicates 
that on August 3, 2004, Motiva disclosed the existence of ""DRC/Price Zone maps for Plaintiffs and other Shell stations allegedly 
competing with Plaintiffs identified in Amended Complaint,"" (Motiva Rule 26 Initial Disclosures [D.E. 19] at 2.) Plaintiffs therefore 
had adequate notice of a price zone system and could have requested discovery on the system at that time if they had wished to 
do so."

171,1," The designation ""AF"" stands for admitted fact and indicates a fact offered by Defendants that Plaintiff has admitted in its 
Responses and Counterstatement of Material Facts Submitted in Response to Exhibit A of the Court's Order Governing 
Proceedings (Doc. # 88), in its representative deposition testimony, or which is undisputed based upon other evidence in the 
Rule 56 file. Whenever Plaintiff has adequately disputed a fact offered by Defendants, the court has accepted Plaintiff's version. 
The court's numbering of admitted facts (e.g., AF No. 1) corresponds to the numbering of Defendants' Statement of Facts. (Doc. 
# 84)."
171,2, The court notes that several of the following admitted facts are derived from the findings contained in the Bankruptcy Order. 
172,3, GSRG understood that Palini e Bertoli had an interest in using the plate mill which was in place in Gadsden. (AF No. 93). 
175,4," The court recognizes that Plaintiff disputes the representation that there was a ""hot"" market for used Steel Mill Assets in China 
or anywhere else in 2002. However, this statement of fact clarifies that the information was part of Casey's opinion and his view 
of the market is not otherwise controverted in the record."
175,5," The court notes that Plaintiff points to evidence that Joe Rutkowski testified that he called Casey after reading the article in the 
American Metal Market reporting on GSRG's intent to reopen the plant. The court disagrees that this testimony creates a 
material dispute of fact because Plaintiff has done nothing to create a factual dispute and undermine Defendants' position that 
the telephone conversation and the meeting occurred on separate occasions (albeit in the same time period)."
175,6," The court acknowledges that Plaintiff challenges the value of the Steel Mill Assets as scrap. However, the statement of fact is 
limited to Nucor's perspective, and nothing in the record refutes that Nucor held this belief in good faith. "
176,7," See n.5, supra."
176,8," To the extent they are potentially material, the court will hereafter address the specific facts identified by Plaintiff in support of 
its counterstatement of material issues."
176,9," The court agrees with GSRG in part. It was not the task of the bankruptcy court to examine the potential anticompetitive effect 
of Park's purchase. That court was called upon to ensure that the process was open, fair, and functionally competitive. "
177,10," The record suggests that it was a sudden downturn in the United States steel industry that caused Gulf States Steel to seek 
protection under the Bankruptcy Code. When it failed to reorganize under Chapter 11, its bankruptcy was converted to a Chapter 
7 liquidation. "
178,11, The Eleventh Circuit also applied this same proof requirement to a plaintiff's Section 2 claims.
178,12," The bankruptcy court has the power, in appropriate circumstances, to refuse to confirm a winning bid at a public auction held 
pursuant to court order where, for example, the sales price is grossly inadequate. In re Muscongus, 597 F.2d 11, 12 (1st Cir. 
1979). Moreover, Bankruptcy Code § 363(n) permits a sale to be avoided if there was an agreement to bid among potential 
bidders. The estate can recover (1) any amount by which the value of the property sold exceeds the price at which such sale 
was consummated, (2) attorneys' fees and costs, and (3) punitive damages for a willful disregard to § 363(n)."
178,13," As Defendants note: ""To accept such a proposition would mean that the Trustee's acceptance of Park's higher bid 'caused' the 
alleged injuries; that the Trustee's rejection of GSRG's nonconforming part credit/part cash bid 'caused' the alleged injuries; that 
the bankruptcy's court's approval of the acceptance of Park's higher bid 'caused' the alleged injuries; and that the bankruptcy 
court's institution of an auction in which winning and losing were mutually exclusive 'caused' GSRG's alleged injuries."" (Doc. # 
83 at p. 13). "
179,14, The jury found the teams engaged in illegal tying and pooling arrangements.
179,15," It is not lost on the court that GSRG's self-imposed bidding limit approximated its outside financing from the Development 
Authority and Jefferson Metal so that GSRG itself would put none of its own money at risk. As Defendants note in their reply 
brief, ""because GSRG was attempting to re-open a plant that (1) had previously failed and (2) the bankruptcy court found could 
not be reorganized and should be liquidated, it was certainly not irrational for Mr. Williams to use only 'other peoples' money' and 
to refuse to put any of his own money at risk."" (Doc. # 99 at p. 4, n.2)."
179,16," Defendants also contend that GSRG's bid limit was below the fair market value of the property as set at the public auction and 
it was GSRG's ally, Mike McCain of the Development Authority, that asked an Italian steel firm (Palini e Bertoli), which had 
expressed interest in purchasing the Steel Mill Assets, to work with GSRG and Frank Williams regarding the potential sale. 
Further, GSRG and Palini e Bertoli specifically discussed their bidding strategies before the auction. (AF No. 34). These facts 
come the closest in this case of hinting at anticompetitive behavior. Ironically, none of the facts involve Defendants' conduct, but 
rather that of GSRG. "
180,17," It is important to understand in this regard that Gulf States Steel is not GSRG. Gulf States Steel, which operated the steel mill 
in Gadsden, Alabama until 2000, went into bankruptcy never to return. GSRG was formed in January 2001 (by persons formerly 
associated with Gulf States Steel) to purchase the Steel Mill Assets. It desired to reopen the closed plant. Thus, at the time 
GSRG was incorporated, the Gadsden steel mill was not operating in the market and GSRG's status is more like a new entrant 
who desired to enter the market by reopening the mill. "
181,18," Palini e Bertoli did not bid after it and GSRG discussed their bidding strategy with one another. If GSRG's efforts to effectively 
exclude Park as a bidder were successful, it would have become the only firm to have bid on the Steel Mill Assets. "
182,19," The Asset Purchase Agreement for the $ 5 million sale of the Steel Mill Assets -- which was struck before the 2002 auction 
among GSRG, the senior secured creditor, and the bankruptcy Trustee -- was by its very terms subject to bankruptcy court 
oversight, objections, and the triggering of a bankruptcy auction."
182,20," In fact, the Gulf States Steel bankruptcy creditors would effectively have subsidized GSRG's purchase of the Steel Mill Assets 
at a price of more than $ 1 million below the ultimate winning bid."
182,21," The parties have spent some time in their briefs arguing about whether GRSG's offer of $ 5 million was ""below market."" The 
court does not believe that is a dispositive issue in this case. It is enough to say that GSRG's initial offer was well below the 
sales price achieved at a fair and competitive auction and, in any event, GSRG had the resources to still win the day by topping 
Park's bid with a higher conforming bid but, for business reasons, opted not to do so. "
183,22," Moreover, GSRG's assertion that Defendants' position is undermined because they could not sell to China at the time of the 
deal is without merit. The undisputed testimony and underlying three-year contract make clear that Defendants believed they 
could make a substantial profit if they were patient and sold in Asia in the next few years. (See Casey Dep. at 18; Rutkowski 
Dep. at 15, 22). That is exactly what they did. Such is the type of business acumen that the antitrust laws are designed to foster, 
not prohibit. See, e.g., United States v. Grinnell, 384 U.S. 563, 570-71, 86 S. Ct. 1698, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1966) (encouraging 
""growth or development as a consequence of… business acumen""). Moreover, the Defendants' reasonable (and time-proven) 
expectation that there would be an upturn in the global steel market is fully confirmed by GSRG's own expectations underlying 
its business plan."
183,23," There is no allegation here that Park's bid was predatory, or involved ""the immediate sacrifice of profits through unreasonable"" 
prices or actions, as Professor Areeda has described it. Phillip E. Areeda et al., Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust 
Principals and their Application, vol. III, § 723a, 272. See also Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 US 574, 
584 n. 8, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). In fact, the undisputed facts show a number of reasons why Park's winning $ 
6.3 million bid cannot be deemed predatory: (1) the original reserve price at the May 2001 auction was $ 7.1 million; (2) GSRG's 
subsequent, but nonconforming, bid was for $ 7 million; (3) an independent appraiser appraised the Steel Mill Assets at $ 19 
million; (4) GSRG represented to potential investors that the assets were worth $ 19-22 million; and (5) Casey ultimately 
arranged for resale of the assets on the used capital asset market for some three times the purchase price paid in the auction."
183,24," Without any evidence of duplicitous, fraudulent or tortious behavior on the part of Defendants, the court is left with the 
undisputed fact that Defendants' actions actually promoted competition. Defendants' actions added one bidder to the bankruptcy 
auction, thwarted an insiders' scheme to purchase the Steel Mill Assets at a below-market price, and increased the ultimate sale 
price received by the Trustee for the Steel Mill Assets. See Classic Communications, Inc., 995 F. Supp. at 1187 (finding that the 
losing bidder's ""alleged injury [did] not result from a reduction in competition""). Defendants' actions were neutral towards GSRG 
with one obvious and appropriate exception: as in any auction and in all robust markets, opposing bidders are competitors. 
Defendants' actions, then, did not distort the market or harm competition in the auction. HN14[
] Without any action that 
diminishes competition, there is no antitrust claim. See, e.g., Levine v. Cent. Fla. Med. Affiliates, Inc., 72 F.3d 1538, 1545 (11th 
Cir. 1996) (""The Supreme Court long ago determined that section 1 prohibits only those agreements that unreasonably restrain 
competition.""); 72 F.3d at 1549 (affirming summary judgment on price fixing allegation because there was no evidence that the 
alleged actions ""facilitated any agreements among its provider panel members to restrict price or any other forms of 
competition."") (emphasis added); Phillips Getschow Co. v. Green Bay Brown County Prof. Football Stadium Dist., 270 F. Supp. 
2d 1043, 1048-49 (E.D. Wis. 2003) (dismissing antitrust claim by losing auction bidder where conduct actually increased 
competition and the increased competition caused plaintiff's alleged injuries)."
183,25," GSRG's assertion that Nucor participated in the 2002 auction because it knew GSRG was going to re-open the mill is not only 
wholly unsupported in the record, but there is direct sworn testimony by both Nucor and Casey to the contrary. See Deposition of "
184,," Carrie Casey at 15-17, 36; Deposition of Joe Rutkowski at 12-15. GSRG's argument is nothing more than an incantation that 
""we don't believe the testimony."" HN15[
] A party cannot defeat summary judgment on this basis. See, e.g., Matsushita Electric Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (""Opponent must do more 
than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.""); Monroe v. Children's Home Ass'n., 128 F.3d 
591, 593 (7th Cir. 1997) (""[A] plaintiff must prove, and not just assert""). Rather, ""the party opposing summary judgment must be 
able to point to some facts which may or will entitle him to judgment, or refute the proof of the moving party in some material 
portion, and . . . the opposing party may not merely recite the incantation, 'Credibility,' and have a trial on the hope that a jury 
may disbelieve factually uncontested proof."" Curl v. International Business Machines Corp., 517 F.2d 212, 214 (5th Cir. 1975) 
(citations omitted). Indeed, a court ""may not weigh evidence and evaluate the credibility of the witnesses at the summary 
judgment state."" Ultimax Transp., Inc. v. British Airways, Inc., 231 F. Supp. 2d 1329, 1335 (N. Ga. 2002)."
184,26," Indeed, as noted by Defendants in their reply brief: All of GSRG's cited cases revolve around either: (1) foreclosures arising from otherwise tortious or illegal acts or per se 
antitrust violations, see, e.g., Perryton Wholesale, Inc. v. Pioneer Distributing Co., 353 F.2d 618 (10th Cir. 1965) (tortious 
interference with existing contractual relations); Int'l Travel Arrangers, Inc. v. W. Airlines, Inc., 623 F.2d 1255 (8th Cir. 1980)

410 U.S. 366, 93 S. Ct. 1022, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1973) (territorial allocation and refusal to deal); or (2) the destruction of 
existing competition by a conspiracy of horizontal competitors, often as part of trade association activities, see, e.g., ES 
Dev., Inc. v. RWM Enters., 939 F.2d 547 (8th Cir. 1991) (parallel actions of nine existing competitors); Am. Med. Ass'n v. 
United States, 317 U.S. 519, 63 S. Ct. 326, 87 L. Ed. 434 (1943) (use of trade association.) (Doc. # 94 at p. 7). "

197,3,"  Other provisions of Rule 8 are inextricably linked to Rule 8(a)'s simplified notice pleading standard. HN6[
] Rule 8(e)(1) states that ""no technical forms of pleading or motions are required,"" and Rule 8(f) provides that ""all pleadings shall be so 
construed as to do substantial justice."" This simplified notice pleading standard relies on liberal discovery rules and 
summary judgment motions to define disputed facts and issues and to dispose of unmeritorious claims. ""The provisions for 
discovery are so flexible and the provisions for pretrial procedure and summary judgment so effective, that attempted 
surprise in federal practice is aborted very easily, synthetic issues detected, and the gravamen of the dispute brought 
frankly into the open for the inspection of the court."" 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1202, p. 76 
(2d ed. 1990) Wynder, 360 F.3d at 77 n. 6 (footnote in the original; renumbered). "
198,4," The Court concluded, however, that it would be ""improper"" to dismiss the case without permitting the plaintiffs to amend their 
pleadings. Klebanow, 344 F.2d at 299-300. "
199,5," One circuit court has employed this definition of ""plausible"" in another context: ""'superficially worthy of belief: CREDIBLE.'""

(""The absence of any plausible motive to engage in the conduct charged is highly relevant to whether a 'genuine issue for trial' 
exists within the meaning of Rule 56(e).""). As we note, however, language setting forth a summary judgment standard must be

factors, including specific information about the relevant business, its condition before and after the restraint was imposed, and 
the restraint's history, nature, and effect."" Id."
201,8," These requirements generally accord with those of courts in other Circuits, though some courts have chosen to divide the 
inquiry into three prongs, rather than two. See, e.g., Tanaka v. Univ. of S. Cal., 252 F.3d 1059, 1062 (9th Cir. 2001); Armstrong

202,9," The plaintiffs point to the holdings of various district courts that have recently reached similar conclusions. See In re Tableware 
Antitrust Litig., 363 F. Supp. 2d 1203, 1206 (N.D. Cal. 2005) (noting that ""in considering whether a complaint provides insufficient 
factual support for a legally viable theory of relief, a useful thought experiment is to ask 'what [the] plaintiff [could] plead in an 
amended complaint to repair the defect,"" and rejecting the proposition that Rule 8 requires allegations of ""'when [the conspiracy] 
conversations took place, how many occurred, who participated, where the conversations took place, [and] what topics were 
discussed' as well as . . . 'meeting dates,' 'meeting places' and [names of] 'individuals employed by . . . defendants who allegedly 
participated'""); Carbon Black, 2005 WL 102966, at *7 n. 7, 2005 U.S. Dist LEXIS 660, at *35 n. 7 (noting that where the question 
is ""how much evidence of an illegal agreement must antitrust plaintiffs plead to avoid dismissal for failure to state a claim . . . the 
answer is certainly some quantum less than will be required at later stages"" of the litigation (citation and internal quotation marks 
omitted, first alteration in original)); In re Pressure Sensitive Labelstock Antitrust Litig., 356 F. Supp. 2d 484, 492 (M.D. Pa. 2005)

Lum v. Bank of Am., 361 F.3d 217, 230 (3d Cir. 2004) and adding emphasis)); N. Jackson Pharmacy, Inc. v. Express Scripts, 
Inc., 345 F. Supp. 2d 1279, 1286 (N.D. Ala. 2004) (noting that ""'plus factor' allegations serve to substantiate a plaintiff's 
conspiracy allegation; their purpose is not to clarify an otherwise incomprehensible claim,"" and that ""just as an employment-
discrimination plaintiff need not allege 'circumstances that support an inference of discrimination,' there is no need for an 
antitrust plaintiff to allege a 'plus factor [which] generates an inference of illegal price fixing.'"" (citations omitted, second alteration 
in original)). "
203,10," But cf. Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 507, 91 L. Ed. 451, 67 S. Ct. 385 (1947) (""The deposition-discovery rules are to be 
accorded a broad and liberal treatment. No longer can the time-honored cry of 'fishing expedition' serve to preclude a party from 
inquiring into the facts underlying his opponent's case."")."
203,11," Charles Dickens, David Copperfield 159 (Jeremy Tambling ed., Penguin Books 1996) (1850). Cf. Weinstock v. Columbia 
Univ., 224 F.3d 33, 49-50 (2d Cir. 2000) (""Plaintiff would have us follow the advice of David Copperfield's mentor, the amicable 
Mr. Micawber, and let matters proceed in the hope that 'something will turn up.' This notion is inconsistent with the text and 
policy behind Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which was intended to prevent such calendar profligacy."" (citation 
omitted)). "
204,12," The Federal Rules are not blind to the financial and other strains that meritless complaints place on defendants and on the 
judiciary. See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 1 (""These rules . . . shall be construed and administered to secure the just, speedy, and 
inexpensive determination of every action.""). The Rules provide a variety of mechanisms for alleviating these burdens, see, e.g., 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c) (providing sanctions against parties for making frivolous or baseless claims, or claims brought for an 
improper purpose), including provisions for ridding the courts and defendants of clearly non-meritorious litigation before 
discovery, see, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (permitting dismissal for ""failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted""); 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c) (permitting judgment on the pleadings). The Rules also provide ""pretrial procedures . . . to disclose more 
precisely the basis of both claim and defense and to define more narrowly the disputed facts and issues,"" as well as to do away 
with non-meritorious claims as the litigation progresses. Conley, 355 U.S. at 48 & n. 9."
204,13," Congress has, for example, attempted to do just that with respect to securities litigation. See Private Securities Litigation 
Reform Act of 1995, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77z-1-2, 78j-1, 78u-4-5 (1997 & Supp. 2003); Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 
1998, Pub. L. No. 105-353, 112 Stat. 3227 (amending scattered provisions of 15 U.S.C., including 15 U.S.C. §§ 77p, 77v, 
78bb). "
205,14," The complaint also relies on a report by the CFA in support of the proposition that the defendants have ""avoided head-to-head 
competition like the plague."" Am. Compl. P 47 (quoting CFA, Lessons From 1996 Telecommunications Act: Deregulation Before 
Meaningful Competition Spells Consumer Disaster 1 (Feb. 2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). And it cites a 
letter from two members of the House of Representatives to the Attorney General requesting an investigation into alleged 
antitrust violations by the Baby Bells. Id. P 45 (citing Letter from Rep. John Conyers Jr. and Rep. Zoe Lofgren to Attorney 
General John D. Ashcroft (Dec. 18, 2002)). These documents, however, even if they are ultimately deemed to constitute 
admissible evidence, are irrelevant at the pleading stage. An allegation that someone has made a similar allegation does not, 
without more, add anything to the complaint's allegations of fact."
205,15," The fact that the defendants have engaged in parallel conduct against their self-interest has been recognized as a ""plus factor"" 
that, if proved at trial, can support the inference of collusion necessary for a jury finding of conspiracy. Apex Oil, 822 F.2d at 254. 
Thus, while plaintiffs pursuing section 1 actions are not required to plead ""plus factors"" to state a claim of conspiracy based on 
parallel anticompetitive conduct, the fact that the plaintiffs appear to be able to do so here makes it particularly difficult to 
conclude that the allegations contained in the complaint are insufficient to state a claim."
205,16," The amended complaint again cites the CFA report, this time for the proposition that the defendants' actions against CLECs 
may be coordinated. Id. P 47. As we concluded, supra note 14, the CFA report consists of mere allegations, and thus does not 
provide factual support for the claims in the amended complaint. "

required to make in that year under the master settlement agreement (as determined pursuant to § IX(i)(2) of the master

provided the required certification; and rendering any cigarettes imported into the state in violation of the Escrow Act or 
Contraband Statutes subject to seizure and forfeiture. See Freedom Holdings, 357 F.3d at 213-14 (referencing N.Y. Tax Law §§

283,19," In analyzing the first Midcal prong--whether the restraint in question is ""clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state 
policy""--the Second Circuit recognized that the statutes at issue were direct legislative activity, but nonetheless found that the 
""ancillary purpose of this Midcal prong . . . is to reveal the State's purposes in agreeing to, and enforcing, the MSA's market-
share provisions. These purposes must be known to ensure that the State's policy goals are sufficient to qualify for the Parker 
immunity--simply protecting private parties from competition is not a sufficient goal."" Id. at 227 (citing Parker, 317 U.S. at 351-
52). The court then conducted a lengthy analysis of the issue, concluding finally that the state had adequately articulated its 
purposes but had not demonstrated that the legislation in question would actually further the supposed policy goals. The court's 
ultimate holding was not, however, based on that finding. See Freedom Holdings, 357 F.3d at 227-31; cf. Freedom Holdings v. 
Spitzer, 363 F.3d 149, 155-57 (2d Cir. 2004) (denying petition for rehearing, but clarifying that it had not relied upon the first

289,22," The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana recently reached the same conclusion, in a virtually 
identical lawsuit, but on different grounds. See Xcaliber Int'l Ltd., LLC v. Ieyoub, 377 F. Supp. 2d 567 (E.D. La. 2005). The court 
there assumed, without analysis, that a deprivation of property had occurred and that some degree of due process was 
warranted to justify such deprivation. The court therefore applied the balancing test set forth in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 
319, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18, 96 S. Ct. 893 (1976), which requires consideration of (1) ""the private interest that will be affected by the 
official action""; (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if 
any, of additional or substitute safeguards""; and (3) ""the government's interest, including the function involved and fiscal and 
administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirements would entail."" Id. at 335, quoted in Xcaliber, 377 
F. Supp. 2d at 576. In light of that test, the court concluded that a hearing was not required under the circumstances because 
the risk of erroneous deprivation of the plaintiffs' property was minimal; additional safeguards would not significantly change the "
290,," risk; and the government's interest in ensuring that ""any judgment rendered against or settlement with the [NPMs] will be 
collectable."" Id."

307,1," This proposal was submitted, in the first instance, to the various specialty boards and medical associations under whose 
sponsorship ABEM operated from 1976 until 1986. These sponsors included the American Boards of Family Practice, Internal 
Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Otolaryngology, Pediatrics, Psychiatry and Neurology, and Surgery, as well as the 
American Medical Association, the American College of Emergency Physicians, and the Society for Academic Emergency 
Medicine."
307,2," ABEM's 1976 application to ABMS for specialty recognition described the practice eligibility track alternative as follows: To be eligible under this category, the applicant must have: A. Accumulated 7,000 hours in practice and/or teaching of emergency medicine"
307,1," . accumulated 2,800 of the 7,000 hours within any 24 month period prior to any application"

1973. Eight years after the first examination administration, the practice eligibility category will expire. ABEM Application to ABMS (Munger Aff. Ex. F (Jan. 27, 1995)) (emphasis added)."
308,3," Other ABMS-approved specialty boards also utilized a temporary practice track during the early years of the specialty. Of the 
six new medical specialty boards established since 1950, including ABEM, all offered practice-track alternatives to residency 
training for between four and ten years, after which successful completion of residency training became the essential 
qualification to sit for a certification exam. Of thirty-three ABMS-approved subspecialties established since 1975, all offered 
practice-track alternatives for between two and five years before insisting on residency training. Munger Aff. PP 27-28 & Ex. J."
308,4," Of the other defendants named in this action, the district court dismissed fifteen hospitals and all but two individual defendants 
in various decisions not challenged on appeal. See Daniel v. Am. Bd. of Emergency Med., 212 F.R.D. 134 (W.D.N.Y. 2002); 
Daniel v. Am. Bd. of Emergency Med., 235 F. Supp. 2d 194 (W.D.N.Y. 2002); Daniel v. Am. Bd. of Emergency Med., 237 F. 
Supp. 2d 336 (W.D.N.Y. 2002); Daniel v. Am. Bd. of Emergency Med., 988 F. Supp. 127, 278-79 (W.D.N.Y. 1997); Daniel v. Am. 
Bd. of Emergency Med., 802 F. Supp. 912 (W.D.N.Y. 1992). In addition, plaintiffs reached prejudgment settlements with three 
dismissed and two remaining hospital defendants. Finally, the appeal to this court was withdrawn or voluntarily dismissed with "
309,," respect to the two remaining individual defendants, Henry A. Thiede and Frank A. Disney, and two hospital defendants, Our 
Lady of Mercy Medical Center and The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Part of the Johns Hopkins Health System."
309,5," Of the twenty-eight original hospital defendants, none was located in the Western District of New York, and only two were 
located in New York State: University Hospital - State University of New York at Stony Brook, located in Suffolk County, and 
Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center, located in New York City. These hospitals were dismissed and are not before us on 
appeal."
309,6," Named plaintiff John A. Timmons, M.D., has now taken and passed the ABEM certification exam, although he was originally 
denied the opportunity to do so when he attempted to establish eligibility under the practice track after that option closed in 1988."
309,7," Plaintiffs allege that the relevant geographic market is the United States and the relevant product market is the market for 
""ABEM certified and ABEM eligible . . . emergency physicians."" Second Am. Compl. PP 91-92. Defendants submit that the 
relevant product market is broader, including all emergency room physicians, not only those who are ABEM certified or eligible. 
Because the district court structured discovery to concentrate the parties' efforts on certain topics other than the relevant 
geographic and product markets, we do not attempt to resolve this dispute on the present record. For purposes of this appeal, 
we assume that the relevant markets are as alleged by the plaintiffs. "
310,8," Plaintiffs have not always been consistent in labeling the theory of their antitrust claims. In their initial brief to this court, they 
appeared to argue a group boycott. Group boycotts ""generally consist of agreements by two or more persons not to do business 
with other individuals, or to do business with them only on specified terms."" Balaklaw v. Lovell, 14 F.3d 793, 800 (2d Cir. 1994) 
(citation and emphasis omitted). Defendants, however, note in their appellate brief that the plaintiffs expressly disclaimed that 
theory in the district court, explaining that their claim is ""not technically"" a group boycott but, instead, ""a conspiracy [claim] to 
raise the prices and keep the prices up."" Daniel v. Am. Bd. of Emergency Med., 269 F. Supp. 2d 159 (W.D.N.Y. 2003). In their 
reply brief, plaintiffs omitted any reference to a group boycott, focusing instead on a theory of market exclusion. At oral argument, they explained that, in fact, their theory would depend on the relevant market: if the market is defined to 
include all emergency physicians, their theory is group boycott; if the market is limited to ABEM-certified and -eligible physicians, 
their theory is market exclusion. As noted in the immediately preceding footnote, on this appeal, we assume that plaintiffs' 
narrower market definition will prevail. Nevertheless, it makes no difference to our analysis which market definition controls this 
case nor whether plaintiffs' claims are presented on a group-boycott or market-exclusion theory."
310,9," Daniel alleged that ABEM violated the New York Human Rights Law by requiring him ""to submit a photograph with his 
application to take the test,"" Compl. P 7, and the Fourteenth Amendment ""by subjecting [him] to arbitrary and capricious 
requirements on a selective basis when the same are not required of others seeking to be qualified as Diplomates of the 
American Board of Emergency Medicine,"" id. P 13. "
311,10," In its second November 19, 1997 opinion, the district court rejected both a constitutional challenge to the service of process 
provision in Section 12 of the Clayton Act and defendant Forsyth Memorial Hospital's motion to certify that question for 
interlocutory appeal. Daniel v. American Bd. of Emergency Med., 988 F. Supp. at 144-45. The constitutional challenge had 
prompted the United States' intervention in this action. See 28 U.S.C. § 2403(a). This issue is not before us on appeal, nor is the 
United States."
311,11," The two individual defendants named in the Second Amended Complaint, Thiede and Disney, both Rochester, New York 
residents, also did not raise jurisdictional defenses, see Daniel v. American Bd. of Emergency Med., 988 F. Supp. at 148 n.4, 
but these individuals are not before us on appeal, as noted supra note 5. "
312,12," Apparently, the district court had concluded on its consideration of defendants' motion to dismiss the First Amended Complaint 
that it had personal jurisdiction over ABEM pursuant to Section 12 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 22, a conclusion defendants 
did not dispute. See Daniel v. American Bd. of Emergency Med., 802 F. Supp. at 918-19. ABEM never objected to personal 
jurisdiction in the district court with respect to the Second Amended Complaint, arguing only that venue was improper in the 
district. See Daniel v. American Bd. of Emergency Med., 988 F. Supp. at 197."
312,13," Indeed, while defendants initially filed a cross-appeal raising challenges to interlocutory rulings by the district court, including 
its rulings on personal jurisdiction and venue, our court dismissed the cross-appeal as unnecessary. See Powell v. Schriver, 175 
F.3d 107, 113 (2d Cir. 1999) (concluding that, without cross-appeal, defendant may raise as alternative ground for affirmance 
qualified immunity defense rejected by district court). "
313,14," To establish venue as to these defendants, the plaintiffs apparently relied on the general venue statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). 
See infra Part II.B. 3. "
315,15," While we are disinclined to speculate from congressional silence or to afford undue weight to punctuation, we note that it 
would have been curious for Congress to have amended an existing sentence providing for expanded venue by inserting, after a 
semicolon, another sentence providing for service of process if the two provisions were intended to operate independently of one 
another. See William Strunk, Jr. & E.B. White, The Elements of Style 6 (4th ed. 2000) (observing that compound sentence joined 
by semicolon is a better way to ""suggest[] the close relationship between the two statements"" than separate sentences 
punctuated by periods). "
316,16," Section 27 of the Exchange Act states in pertinent part: Any criminal proceeding [under this chapter] may be brought in the district wherein any act or transaction constituting the 
violation occurred. Any suit or action to enforce any liability or duty created by this chapter or rules and regulations 
thereunder, or to enjoin any violation of such chapter or rules and regulations, may be brought in any such district or in the 
district wherein the defendant is found or is an inhabitant or transacts business, and process in such cases may be served 
in any other district of which the defendant is an inhabitant or wherever the defendant may be found. "
317,17," The plaintiffs did not argue before the district court, nor do they contend on appeal, that any of the jurisdiction defendants is an 
""inhabitant"" of the Western District of New York or may be ""found"" there. Thus, these alternative grounds for Section 12 venue 
have never been at issue. "
320,18," The district court rejected as a basis for venue, and properly so in our view, the New York residence of then-ABEM president 
G. Richard Braen and former board member and director Henry A. Thiede. See Daniel v. American Bd. of Emergency Med., 
988 F. Supp. at 275. There is no claim that these individuals took any action at all in New York related to the antitrust claim, let 
alone any action that might constitute a ""substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the"" antitrust claim. Nor is it 
alleged that any part of the activities of CORD or the hospital defendants alleged to give rise to the antitrust claims occurred in 
New York. "
323,19, Section 4 states in pertinent part: 
324,," HN25[
] Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws 
may sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an 
agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the 
cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."
324,15, U.S.C. § 15(a).
324,20," Section 16 states in pertinent part: HN26[
] Any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of 
the United States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws . 
. . ."
324,15, U.S.C. § 26. 
326,21," We note, but need not here discuss, defendants' statistical showing that the supply of doctors eligible to take the ABEM 
certification exam has, in fact, grown by several multiples between the closing of the practice track in 1988, a year in which 367 
doctors entered residency training programs, and 1999, a year in which 1,039 doctors graduated from such training programs."
326,22," At oral argument on appeal, plaintiffs' counsel indicated that his clients do not, in fact, question ABEM's right to limit its 
certification to doctors who have completed residency training programs, a significant concession because that decision had 
appeared to be the critical factor supporting their claim of restraint on trade. Counsel explained that plaintiffs assert that ABEM, 
by offering a practice-track option for certification - but only for eight years - restricts competition between those doctors who 
qualified for ABEM certification under the practice track and those who no longer have that option. Carried to its logical 
conclusion, plaintiffs' argument would require ABEM to maintain a practice track alternative in perpetuity. When asked about that 
possibility, however, counsel conceded that, at some future point, presumably after plaintiffs also acquired ABEM certification, it "
327,," would be appropriate to close the practice track. This suggests that plaintiffs' complaint is not about the qualification restrictions 
ABEM puts on doctors wishing to sit for its certification examination. It is not even about the propriety of a practice-track option to 
allow competition with doctors who acquire ABEM certification after residency training. Instead, plaintiffs' case reduces to a 
dispute about when ABEM could retire the practice-track option. But nowhere in the record do plaintiffs demonstrate that it was 
premature for ABEM to retire the practice track in 1988 (after giving medical students and doctors eight years' notice), much less 
do plaintiffs show that they suffered any antitrust injury from closure at this time rather than at some later date that would allow 
them entry into the purported ABEM cartel."
327,23," Ertag v. Naples Cmty. Hosp., No. 95-3134, slip op. at 2 (11th Cir. Aug. 1, 1997) (unpublished), an unpublished decision of the 
Eleventh Circuit relied on extensively by plaintiffs, similarly involves plaintiffs who sought to end the allegedly anticompetitive 
practice at issue, not to join it. "
328,24," For example, if as ABEM diplomates, plaintiffs could, in fact, command $ 50,000 more in annual remuneration (the difference 
identified in their complaint between themselves and ABEM-certified counterparts), see Second Am. Compl. P 104, then the total 
cost to consumers (hospitals, patients, and insurers) of emergency medical care would increase, a result of no interest to 
antitrust law. Even if plaintiffs' entry into the ABEM market resulted in a decrease in the pay presently commanded by certified 
doctors but an increase in plaintiffs' pay, that would not necessarily translate into a total cost savings for consumers. As the 
magistrate judge observed with respect to plaintiffs' pleaded theory of injury: ""the economic complexities of the health care 
services market, including a high degree of government regulation and financial involvement,"" require ""sophisticated economic 
analysis"" to determine if ""the normal laws of supply and demand can even be applied"" in this case. Daniel v. American Bd. of 
Emergency Med., 269 F. Supp. 2d at 182-83. The same conclusion applies to plaintiffs' proposed amended theory of injury. 
Careful economic analysis is necessary to determine the overall competitive effect and consumer benefit from an action that 
would move a significant number of doctors - namely, the plaintiffs - out of one product market, where physicians not certified by 
ABEM provide emergency medical care for modest compensation, into another market, where a limited number of ABEM-
certified doctors charge significantly higher rates for essentially the same services. "
331,25," Of course, not all exclusions are violations of the Sherman Act. See, e.g., White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 
263, 9 L. Ed. 2d 738, 83 S. Ct. 696 (1963) (stating that vertical territorial limitations ""may be allowable protections against 
aggressive competitors or the only practicable means a small company has for breaking into or staying in business"" and hence 
permissible under the antitrust laws); Angelico, 184 F.3d at 276 n. 3 (stating in a health care exclusion case that ""group boycotts 
or concerted refusals to deal are not always per se violations of the Sherman Act; rather, the analysis turns on the facial effects 
of the challenged practice.""); Retina Assocs., P.A. v. Southern Baptist Hosp., 105 F.3d 1376 (11th Cir. 1997) (holding that a 
referral agreement between non-specialized ophthalmologists and a retina specialist, under which the plaintiffs, retina 
specialists, received virtually no referrals, was neither per se unreasonable nor illegal under the rule of reason analysis). "
332,26," Moreover, such questions simply cannot be resolved without significant additional discovery, a fact that the majority opinion 
seems to acknowledge, when it states that ""careful economic analysis is necessary to determine the overall competitive effect 
and consumer benefit from"" permitting non-ABEM-certified emergency medicine physicians to become ABEM-certified. Majority 
Op. at 65 n.24. "
333,27," Indeed, at least one commentator has concluded ""the Todorov court's approach to antitrust injury was wrong,"" because the 
antitrust injury question does not require the involved economic analysis engaged in by Todorov, analysis that is more relevant

The Strangely Elusive Doctrine of Antitrust Injury, 70 Antitrust L.J. 697, 750 (2003). "
334,28," It is worth noting that were we to transfer this case, we would presumably transfer it the Western District of Michigan, where 
ABEM is located, and where the plaintiffs' applications were denied. Because Michigan is in the Sixth Circuit, if the Potters facts 
relating to antitrust standing are essentially similar to those here, as I believe they are, Potters would control. "

366,4," We take note of the dissent's argument that the case should now be sent to the Ninth Circuit for decision of the Walker Process 
and other patent/antitrust issues raised by the appellant, on the theory that the complaint should, after this appellate decision, be 
deemed to have been ""constructively amended"" to have been filed without the patent counts of the complaint. Neither statute nor 
precedent provides support for such a procedure, and indeed they weigh heavily against it. In none of the ""authority"" mentioned 
by the dissent was the complaint subject to retrospective amendment of well-pleaded issues after the legal status of the parties 
had been altered. The Court in Christianson v. Colt confirmed that jurisdiction ""is determined by reference to the well-pleaded 
complaint, not the well tried case."" 486 U.S. at 814; see also Holmes Group v. Vornado Air Circulation Sys., Inc., 535 U.S. 826, 
832, n.3, 153 L. Ed. 2d 13, 122 S. Ct. 1889 (2002). The purpose of the rule is to determine jurisdiction at the outset of litigation, 
to avoid throwing the parties into ""a perpetual game of jurisdictional ping-pong."" Id. at 818. To bifurcate an appeal after some of 
the issues are decided offers the worst of all possibilities, for it would not be known whether some issues would be shipped 
elsewhere, to be redocketed and rebriefed and reargued and reappealed, until after the Federal Circuit decided other issues. 
Such a situation is devoid of support. "

421,15," It is true that had the defendants not settled the underlying patent litigation and had the district court's judgment been affirmed 
on appeal, Zeneca would have been estopped from asserting the validity of its patent against others seeking to enter the market. 
See Blonder-Tongue Labs., Inc. v. Univ. of Ill. Found., 402 U.S. 313, 350, 91 S. Ct. 1434, 28 L. Ed. 2d 788 (1971). However, it is 
clearly a permissible byproduct of settlement that future hypothetical plaintiffs might be forced to relitigate the same issues 
involved in the settled case. Furthermore, before 1994, when district court judgments were vacated as a matter of course upon 
settlement, see U.S. Bancorp, 513 U.S. at 29 (virtually ending this practice), there was similarly and permissibly no collateral 
estoppel effect accorded these judgments for the benefit of future hypothetical plaintiffs. See Nestle, 756 F.2d at 284 
(""Drumbeating about the need to protect other unknown users of the trademark [in question] will ring hollow indeed in the ears of 
the present defendants if the peril of a reversal is realized. . . . We see no justification to force these defendants, who wish only 
to settle the present litigation, to act as unwilling private attorneys general and to bear the various costs and risks of litigation.""). "
422,16," It may be worth noting, although in and of itself it seems to us to prove little, that the Federal Circuit reversed district court 
determinations of patent invalidity at a relatively high rate during the relevant time period. See Donald R. Dunner et al., A 
Statistical Look at the Federal Circuit's Patent Decisions: 1982-1994, 5 Fed. Cir. B.J. 151, 154-55 (1995)."
422,17," We thus think that it was appropriate for the district court to take these decisions into account for the limited purpose of 
rebutting the plaintiffs' conclusory allegation that the Federal Circuit would have affirmed Judge Broderick's decision invalidating 
the tamoxifen patent. See Mason v. Am. Tobacco Co., 346 F.3d 36, 39 (2d Cir. 2003) (""Legal conclusions, deductions or

cases pending before the Second Circuit settle each year). "
424,19," In this case, Barr could not at the time of the Settlement Agreement count on obtaining the 180-day exclusive period from the 
FDA because, as a settler rather than a ""successful defender,"" it at least appeared that it was unlikely to be entitled to the period 
of exclusivity -- in other words, it appeared that, by settling, Barr was trading away its exclusivity period. It is noteworthy, 
nonetheless, that HN26[
] the 180-day period is of substantial benefit to the generic drug manufacturer who obtains it because 
it gives that manufacturer a significant head start over other manufacturers. See, e.g., Geneva Pharms. Tech. Corp. v. Barr 
Labs. Inc., 386 F.3d 485, 494, 510 (2d Cir. 2004) (considering claim that defendant's first-mover status converted a transitory 
advantage into a permanent one, where plaintiffs provided testimony that ""even though its offer price to the Eckerd and CVS 
drugstore chains was as much as 25 percent below [the first mover's price], neither chain was willing to leave [the first mover] 
after having devoted substantial time to switching patients and getting their pharmacists comfortable with the new product""); 
Mova Pharm., 955 F. Supp. at 131 (""All parties recognize that the earliest generic drug manufacturer in a specific market has a 
distinct advantage over later entrants."")."
424,20," It has been observed that even the typical settlement of the ordinary patent infringement suit appears to involve what may be 
characterized as a reverse payment. See Cipro II, 261 F. Supp. 2d at 252 (""Even in the traditional context, implicit consideration 
flows from the patent holder to the alleged infringer.""); cf. Asahi Glass, 289 F. Supp. 2d at 994 (""Any settlement agreement can 
be characterized as involving 'compensation' to the defendant, who would not settle unless he had something to show for the 
settlement. If any settlement agreement is thus to be classified as involving a forbidden 'reverse payment,' we shall have no 
more patent settlements."" (emphasis in original)); Daniel A. Crane, Ease Over Accuracy in Assessing Patent Settlements, 88 
Minn. L. Rev. 698, 700 (2004) (""It makes no sense to single out exclusion payments for disfavor when the same potential for 
collusion arises in any settlement involving the defendant's exit.""). A blanket rule that all settlements involving reverse payments 
are unlawful could thus conceivably endanger many ordinary settlements of patent litigation. "
425,21," The Federal Trade Commission and some commentators have proposed similar or even more stringent rules. See In re 
Schering-Plough Corp., No. 9297, final order at 4, 2003 WL 22989651, 136 F.T.C. 956, 2003 FTC LEXIS 187 (Fed. Trade 
Comm'n Dec. 8, 2003) (applying a rule under which generic manufacturers would not be permitted to receive reverse payments 
that exceeded ""the lesser of the [patent] holder's expected future litigation costs to resolve the Patent Infringement Claim or $ 2 
million""), vacated, 402 F.3d 1056 (11th Cir. 2005); Hovenkamp et al., supra, at 1759 (proposing that ""in an antitrust challenge, a 
payment from a patentee to an infringement defendant for the latter's exit from the market is presumptively unlawful,"" and that 
the ""infringement plaintiff can defend by showing both (1) that the ex ante likelihood of prevailing in its infringement lawsuit is 
significant, and (2) that the size of the payment is no more than the expected value of litigation and collateral costs attending the 
lawsuit"")."
425,22," The dissent questions what it sees as our reliance on the presumption of validity of the patent at the time of the settlement. 
Post at [16-17]. Even after a district court holds a patent invalid, it is treated as presumptively valid under 35 U.S.C. § 282 on 
appeal. See Rosco, Inc. v. Mirror Lite Co., 304 F.3d 1373, 1377-78 (Fed. Cir. 2002). But irrespective of whether there was a 
presumption or where any such presumption lay at the time of settlement, we think that Zeneca was then entitled to protect its 
tamoxifen patent monopoly through settlement. The question for this Court is whether the settlement extended the patent's 
scope. If the judgment of the district court against a patent's validity put an end to the patent monopoly that the patent holder 
was entitled to protect, then any settlement after judgment of the district court holding the patent invalid would extend the patent 
monopoly beyond the patent's scope and therefore be unlawful. We do not think that to be the law, a view which appears to be 
consistent with the plaintiffs'. See Appellants' Reply Br. at 4, Heading ""B."" (""Hatch-Waxman Patent Infringement Litigation Can 
Be Settled, Even On Appeal, Without Violating The Antitrust Laws."")."
425,23," There is authority for the proposition that when its patent monopoly is ended, the patent holder might actually raise the price 
on its branded product, rather than lower it in response to generic competition. See Congr. Budget Office, How Increased "
426,," Competition from Generic Drugs Has Affected Prices and Returns in the Pharmaceutical Industry 29-31 (July 1998), available at 
http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/6xx/doc655/pharm.pdf (last visited May 12, 2005)."
426,24," To illustrate using a vastly oversimplified hypothetical example (ignoring, for example, legal fees and costs): Suppose the 
patent holder is selling 1,000,000 pills per year at a $ 1 profit per pill (for a total profit of $ 1,000,000). The generic manufacturer 
files a paragraph IV ANDA, and the patent holder responds by bringing suit to protect its patent. If the patent holder projects that, 
should it lose the suit, it will thereafter sell only 250,000 pills per year at a $. 90 profit per pill (for a total profit of $ 225,000) in the 
competitive market, and the generic will sell 750,000 pills per year at a profit of $. 60 per pill (for a total profit of $ 450,000) -- so 
that total market profits are now down from $ 1,000,000 to $ 675,000 -- it would make economic sense for the patent holder to 
pay the generic manufacturer something more than the $ 450,000 the generic manufacturer would make in a competitive market 
to settle the litigation. If it paid $ 500,000 a year to the generic manufacturer -- $ 50,000 more than the generic manufacturer 
could earn in the market in a ""best case scenario"" -- for example, it would thereby retain the ability to make $ 500,000 per year 
selling its branded pills ($ 1,000,000 profit less $ 500,000 per year paid to the generic), $ 275,000 more per year than it would 
earn if it paid nothing to the generic but lost the patent litigation and with it the patent monopoly. It might well be sensible for the 
patent holder to enter into this sort of settlement, depending in part on its perceived prospects for winning the litigation, and it 
would seem difficult for the generic manufacturer to refuse. The $ 325,000 of yearly monopoly profits which accrued to the 
patent holder before the litigation began would thereafter be divided between the patent holder and the generic manufacturer. "
428,25," It seems to us odd for the dissent to urge, in the context of this case, that we have not given proper weight to ""the public 
interest in having the validity of patents litigated."" Post at [9]. The Settlement Agreement was a virtual invitation to other generic 
manufacturers to file paragraph IV certifications and thereby court litigation as to the validity of the tamoxifen patent. It was an 
invitation that was accepted three times leading to three lawsuits, two of them litigated to judgment, as to the validity of the 
tamoxifen patent. Accepting the value of litigating the validity of patents in these circumstances, it has hardly been undermined 
here."
428,26," The dissent ""see[s] no reason why the general standard for evaluating an anti-competitive agreement, i.e., its reasonableness, 
should not govern in this context."" Post at [13]. We think, such a rule, making every settlement of patent litigation, at least in the 
Hatch-Waxman Act context, subject to the inevitable, lengthy and expensive hindsight of a jury as to whether the settlement 
constituted a ""reasonable"" restraint (and, in this case, whether the Federal Circuit would have affirmed or reversed in a patent 
appeal), would place a huge damper on such settlements contrary to the law that we have discussed at some length that 
settlements are not only permitted, they are to be encouraged."
428,27," The reasoning of the dissent, which quotes an excerpt from this statement, post at [5], is, in our view, largely based on a 
repeated mis-characterization of our views in this regard. We do not, as the dissent states in one form or another many times, 
see post at [6], [7 - 9], [13], [16], and [18], think that there is a ""requirement"" that antitrust plaintiffs ""must show that the settled 
litigation was a sham, i.e., objectively baseless, before the settlement can be considered an antitrust violation . . . ,"" id. at [6]. 
There is no such requirement. The central criterion as to the legality of a patent settlement agreement is whether it ""exceeds the 
'scope of the patent's protection.'"" As we pointed out at the outset of this discussion, we think that ""if the plaintiffs alleged facts "
429,," that, if proved, would establish that the Settlement Agreement provided the defendants with benefits exceeding the scope of the 
tamoxifen patent, they would succeed in alleging an antitrust violation."" Ante at [26]; see also, e.g., post at [55] (""The question is 
whether the ""exclusionary effects of the agreement"" exceed the 'scope of the patent's protection.' Schering-Plough, 402 F.3d at 
1076.""). A plaintiff need not allege or prove sham litigation in order to succeed in establishing that a settlement has provided 
defendants ""with benefits exceeding the scope of the tamoxifen patent."" Whether there is fraud or baseless litigation may be 
relevant to the inquiry, but it is hardly, we think, ""the . . . standard,"" post at [14], as the dissent posits in order to take issue with 
it. "
430,28," See Asahi Glass, 289 F. Supp. 2d at 994 (noting that in the typical reverse-payment case, ""the settlement leaves the 
competitive situation unchanged from before the defendant tried to enter the market.""). "
431,29," Of course, as it turned out, Zeneca was successful in subsequently protecting its patent in the courts. "
432,30," ""The competitive concern is that the 180-day exclusivity provision can be used strategically by a patent holder to prolong its 
market power in ways that go beyond the intent of the patent laws and the Hatch-Waxman Act by delaying generic entry for a 
substantial period."" Balto, supra, at 331. An agreement that a ""generic manufacturer would not relinquish its 180-day exclusivity . 
. . prevent[s] other generic manufacturers from entering as well."" Id. at 335; see also Hovenkamp et al., supra, at 1755 (""It is 
widely understood that the 180-day exclusivity period offers the potential for collusive settlement arrangements between 
pioneers and generics. A pioneer could initiate a patent infringement suit against a first generic ANDA filer and settle the 
litigation with a 'non-entry' payment to the generic, under which the generic would delay commercialization of the generic 
product, thus postponing the commencement of the 180-day exclusivity period and locking other generics out of the market 
indefinitely."")."
432,31," In Andrx, the defendant attempted unsuccessfully to claim that it was unable to cause any delay in generic entry because the 
""successful defense"" requirement would prevent it from doing so. Andrx Pharms., 256 F.3d at 810. The D.C. Circuit noted that 
the settlement agreement in that case was signed in September 1997 -- after the district court in Mova issued, in January 1997, 
a preliminary injunction banning the enforcement of the successful defense requirement. Id. (citing Mova Pharm., 955 F. Supp. 
at 131-32). Thus, ""the timing of the Agreement and of the demise of the successful defense requirement defeats Andrx's 
argument on this point."" Id. In the instant case, however, the Settlement Agreement was executed long before Mova struck down 
the successful defense requirement. "
433,32," The dissent says that a reasonable fact-finder might conclude that sophisticated parties would not have included a provision 
that allowed Barr to re-file under paragraph IV absent an unlawfully anticompetitive purpose because it ""had no potential benefit 
to either of them"" apart from an anti-competitive one. Post at [19]. We disagree. If another generic manufacturer had been 
successful in having the tamoxifen patent held invalid, it was strongly and legitimately in Barr's interest to be able to re-file so 
that it could market tamoxifen without risking a violation of the Settlement Agreement. "
435,33," Like the majority, I use ""Zeneca"" to refer collectively to defendants Zeneca, Inc., Astrazeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, and 
AstraZeneca, Inc. ""Barr"" refers to defendant Barr Labs, Inc. "
437,34," Noerr-Pennington immunity derives from both  Noerr and United Mine Workers of Am. v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 
1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965). "
438,35," The majority suggests, [majority op. at 53 n.25] that this interest was adequately protected through the subsequent suits by 
other generics. I disagree. This position ignores the time gap between the Barr-Zeneca litigation and the subsequent litigation. 
During this period, had Barr maintained its victory on appeal, which, as I explain below, was quite likely, very ill consumers would 
have had access to low cost generic tamoxifen. In addition, once Zeneca's patent protection was gone with respect to Zeneca, it 
was gone with respect to all generic manufacturers, which would have produced a very competitive market at the close of the 
180-day exclusivity period. Thus, it was very important to the public interest that Barr and Zeneca allow the appeal to proceed. 
This does not mean, as the majority suggests at 49 n.25 that any settlement of patent litigation after the challenger prevails at 
trial is an antitrust violation. As I discuss at [13-14] below, a Hatch-Waxman settlement agreement, even on appeal from a 
judgment declaring the patent invalid, is not a per se antitrust violation. Rather, a reviewing court must assess the reasonability 
of the settlement by weighing various factors including the strength of the patent as it appeared at the time of settlement. "
439,36," Of course, other generic challengers could file Paragraph IV certifications before the first litigation is resolved, but a second 
generic manufacturer has little incentive to incur the cost of litigation. Even if it wins, it will have to wait until after the first generic 
challenger's exclusivity period has expired to market its product. "
440,37," The majority argues that applying the general rule of reasonableness would ""make every settlement of patent litigation, at least 
in the Hatch-Waxman Act context, subject to the inevitable, lengthy and expensive hindsight of a jury as to whether the 
settlement constituted a 'reasonable' restraint (and, in this case, whether the Federal Circuit would have affirmed or reversed in 
a patent appeal)"" and thus ""place a huge damper on such settlements."" Majority op. at [53 n.26]. I doubt that this doomsday 
scenario would, in fact, take place. Courts would eventually develop rules for judging the reasonableness of a settlement, and as 
with other litigation, the majority of cases would be resolved in motion practice. Moreover, the majority again emphasizes the 
acknowledged interest in settlements without acknowledging the absent party in Hatch Waxman litigation settlements, the 
consumer of medicines. Those consumers have no ability to affect the settlement, which, in some cases, may benefit both 
parties beyond any expectation they could have from the litigation itself while harming the consumer. There is a panglossian 
aspect to the majority's tacit assumption that the settling parties will not act to injure the consumer or competition. "
441,38," The majority also relies on Boehm v. Comm'r, 146 F.2d 553 (2d Cir. 1945), aff'd, 326 U.S. 287, 66 S. Ct. 120, 90 L. Ed. 78, 
1945 C.B. 353 (1945). This case also is strikingly inapposite; the Boehm court held only that a taxpayer must claim a loss in the 
year it becomes obvious and cannot rely on the inherently speculative outcome of litigation seeking to recover some of that loss 
to justify claiming it in a later year. 146 F.2d at 555. The relevance of that principle to the case at hand is not immediately 
obvious to me. It is also interesting to note that the Supreme Court affirmed not on the impossibility of predicting litigation 
outcome but rather because the Tax Court had found that the suit had ""no substantial value"" and ""there was no evidence in the 
stipulation of the merits of the suit, the probability of recovery or any assurance of collection of an amount sufficient to pay the 
creditors' claim . . . and to provide a sufficient surplus for stockholders."" 326 U.S. at 294. The majority's additional reliance on 
Asahi Glass Co. v. Pentech Pharms, 289 F. Supp. 2d 986, 993 (N.D. Il. 2003), and In re Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride Antitrust 
Litig., 261 F. Supp. 2d. 188, 200-01 (E.D.N.Y. 2003), requires little discussion. The statement quoted from Asahi Glass that ""no 
one can be certain that he will prevail in a patent suit""-is irrelevant to the capacity of skilled corporate counsel and district court 
judges to evaluate the likelihood that a determination of patent invalidity will be upheld, and the discussion in Ciprofloxacin relies 
primarily on Whitmore and Boehm, which I have already discussed. "
442,39," I do not find persuasive the statistics the majority cites on the frequency of reversal in the Federal Circuit. These statistics 
would include decisions construing the patent and making other legal determinations. Therefore, they do nothing to show how 
frequently the Federal Circuit reverses credibility determinations on appeal."
442,40," I recognize that it makes more sense to use the subsequent litigation to argue that plaintiffs could not prove the Zeneca 
lawsuit was not a sham. However, as noted, I do not believe this is an appropriate test. "
457,1," Shortly before trial, defendants gave notice of their intent to challenge the constitutionality of RLUIPA, and the court gave the 
notice to the United States required by 28 U.S.C. § 2403(a). On October 28, 2005, the United States moved to intervene but 
stated it did not intend to file a brief unless the court indicated a desire to have a brief on the constitutional issue. The court has 
granted the motion to intervene so that the United States can participate in the case. Because the court rejects plaintiff's RLUIPA 
claim on the merits, the court has not reached the constitutional issue and has not requested additional briefing on it. "
460,2," As originally passed on April 18, 2005 (Ordinance No. 4-1-6), Section 3(e) gave even more explicit protection to Morgan 
Hospital, stating that the Ordinance would not apply to: ""A new health service constructed by an existing hospital facility located 
in Morgan County that will not duplicate a health service available at the County-owned hospital . . . or other County 
governmental health program."" Jt. Ex. 1 at 3. "
462,3," This case contains no trace of a joint venture between St. Francis and Morgan Hospital that might serve to remove a market 
allocation from the per se rule of Topco. See generally Rothery Storage & Van Co. v. Atlas Van Lines, Inc., 253 U.S. App. D.C. 
142, 792 F.2d 210, 225-30 (D.C. Cir. 1986). "
463,4," Morgan Hospital's Rule 12(b)(6) motion argued that St. Francis does not actually seek coercive relief against Morgan Hospital. 
The motion also argued that Morgan Hospital's involvement in proposing and supporting enactment of the Ordinance is 
protected by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. See United Mine Workers of America v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 669-70, 85 S. 
Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965); Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 134-140, 
81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961). The court is not granting any coercive relief against Morgan Hospital. However, given the 
evidence of Morgan Hospital's involvement in the drafting and enactment of the Ordinance, as well as the clear interest it has in 
the Ordinance's enforcement, it was reasonable for St. Francis to name Morgan Hospital as a defendant. Morgan Hospital has 
an interest relating to the subject of this action, and at least some possible outcomes of this case could impair Morgan Hospital's 
ability to protect that interest. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(2); Dickinson v. Indiana State Election Board, 933 F.2d 497, 500-02 (7th 
Cir. 1991) (ordering district court to determine liability first on claims based on legislative districting and then, if liability were 
found, to consider possible joinder of additional defendant under Rule 19 to determine and implement injunctive remedy). "
466,5," St. Francis also has not tried to show that the Ordinance places governmental regulatory decisions in the hands of private 
actors, the kind of ""hybrid"" restraint that has typically been excepted from the Fisher unilateral action rule. See Fisher, 475 U.S. 
at 268 (""Where private actors are thus granted a degree of private regulatory power,' the regulatory scheme may be attacked 
under § 1."")(citations omitted). The Ordinance does not require approval of competing hospitals or any other private actor for 
expansion. Just as Berkeley placed decisions on variances from rent control ceilings in the city's Rent Stabilization Board in 
Fisher, 475 U.S. at 269, Morgan County's Ordinance places decisions on hospital expansion in the County Commissioners. "
467,6," St. Francis has not asserted any claim for attempted monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2. "
468,7," HN21[
] RLUIPA applies to all substantial burdens imposed: (1) in a program receiving federal financial assistance; (2) under 
circumstances in which the burden affects commerce with foreign nations, among the several States, or with Indiana tribes; or 
(3) as part of a land use regulation system in which the government makes, or is permitted to make, individualized assessments 
of the proposed uses for the property at issue. 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc(a)(2). "

473,9," In light of the Ordinance's severability clause, the court expresses no opinion on whether the Ordinance might be applied to

486,1," When reviewing alleged tying agreements, California courts may seek guidance from federal law construing the Sherman 
Antitrust Act, which also prohibits tying agreements. (Morrison, supra, 66 Cal.App.4th at p. 541.) "
487,2," RLH also contends Positron's free training is an unfair “kickback.” But Positron offers its training to any current or prospective 
customer, without requiring recipients to buy its devices. There is nothing unfair about that. "
488,3," We do not consider the SBC marketing material and Internet web pages that RLH cites in its appellate briefs, because RLH did 
not offer that material in opposition to SBC's summary judgment motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c) [summary judgment 
motions are decided on “all the evidence set forth in the papers”].) "
489,4," SBC also relies on In re Brand Name Prescription Drugs (7th Cir. 1997) 123 F.3d 599. But there, the court held federal 
antitrust law did not preempt state antitrust law, and directed the federal district court to remand the plaintiff's state law 
antitrust claims to the state court. (Id. at pp. 611–613.) The phrase SBC pulls from the case—“A state cannot regulate sales that 
take place wholly outside it. [Citation.] State A cannot use its antitrust law to make a seller in State B charge a lower price to a 
buyer in C”—is dicta. (Id. at p. 613.) Moreover, it does not reflect the allegations in this case. RLH seeks to use State A's 
antitrust law to make a competitor in State B stop anticompetitive practices that cause injury in State A. "
490,5," Even if we wanted to conduct a Pike balancing analysis for SBC, the record SBC developed for summary judgment would not 
allow us to do so at this time."
490,6," The Diamond Multimedia court further noted that the California securities law in question permitted the same recovery already 
“allowed under federal securities law and we are unable to see how permitting [such] recovery under [California law] imposes 
any burden on interstate commerce. Quite the opposite.” (Diamond Multimedia, supra, 19 Cal.4th at p. 1063.) Similarly here, 
both California and federal law bar tying arrangements. "
501,1," Coastal disputes Balaban's assertion concerning the overall number of cranes sold in the United States. (Mirando Decl., at 
PP58-59.) Specifically, Coastal contends that C2C has presented two irreconcilable statements concerning the number of 
cranes sold in the United States. (Id.) On the one hand, C2C states that Play Meter 2004 indicates that there are 41,000 cranes 
on location in the United States. (Balaban Decl., at P8.) On the other hand, C2C states that another industry publication, 
Vending Times, indicates that 108,000 cranes were on location in the United States in 2004. (Id. at PP9, 10.) As Coastal points 
out, there is a large discrepancy between these two numbers; however, for purposes of determining the merits of C2C's 
contentions here, the Court will use the number of cranes proposed by C2C. "
502,2," C2C referenced this amount to its purchase of Wu Mar's model # 188-31"" crane. (C2C's Br., at 5.)"
502,3," C2C sold: 13 cranes in 2000, 75 cranes in 2001, 265 cranes in 2002, 523 cranes in 2003, 485 cranes in 2004, and 792 cranes 
as of August 9, 2005. (Balaban Decl., at P24.)"
502,4," C2C also has three crane technicians and has a one-year warranty program for new cranes. (Maurer Decl., at P18.)"
502,5," C2C contends that prior to Coastal's interest in Wu Mar cranes, Gary Balaban of C2C (""Balaban"") -- having known the 
principals of Coastal for many years -- had ""numerous"" conversations with Coastal about Wu Mar cranes. (Balaban Decl., at 
P25.) Additionally, C2C states that ""C2C disclosed [to Coastal] the particulars about the Wu Mar cranes, including pricing and 
manufacturing information, the exceptional customer service offered by [Wu Mar] and [Wu Mar's] willingness to accept and 
incorporate C2C's modifications to the Cranes."" (C2C's Br., at 8.) Coastal disputes C2C's contention and states that its principals 
had no conversations with Balaban regarding Wu Mar cranes. (Mirando Decl., at P8.) "
503,6," C2C in response to Wei's September 22, 2004 e-mail, informs Wu Mar that ""part of our new ads will remove all pricing of the 
cranes, this should make everyone happy."" (Balaban Decl., at P34 & Ex. E; Wei Decl., at P30.) This appears to refute C2C's 
assertion that Wu Mar requested C2C to remove its prices from advertisements. Instead, C2C intimated to Wu Mar its 
willingness to remove all pricing from its advertisements without provocation by Wu Mar. "
506,7," C2C claims to have received only five of the seven containers. (Balaban Decl., at P45.) "
507,8," These amounts were for a crane with a wooden cabinet. (Balaban Decl., at P53.) C2C determined that the cost for a metal 
cabinet, similar to Wu Mar cranes, was even greater. (Id.)"
507,9," To the extent that the ""Conclusions of Law"" portion of this memorandum opinion contains findings of fact in addition to those

fact. The ""Conclusions of Law"" subsections of this memorandum opinion generally do not contain citations to the evidence except 
after quoted language. The record citations are set forth in the ""Chronology of Events-Factual Findings"" section of this

508,10," A preliminary injunction is prohibitory if it ""seeks only to maintain the status quo pending a trial on the merits."" Tom Doherty, 60 
F.3d at 33."
508,11," In the first count and the second count, C2C alleges that the defendants violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act and NJAA § 
56:9-3, respectively. As C2C admits, these provisions essentially mirror one another, and as the state cases look to federal 
decisions for guidance, the Court addresses these claims together for the purposes of this motion. (C2C's Br., at 21 n.1 (citing 
Michael Halebian N.J., Inc. v. Roppe Rubber Corp., 718 F.Supp. 348, 355 (D.N.J. 1989) (citations omitted)). "
509,12," Although C2C did not brief a Section 1 claim under a rule of reason analysis, it did mention this alternative theory in its 
complaint. (See Compl., at PP71, 72.) C2C has not asserted that the Court apply the ""quick look"" rule of reason analysis. See National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n v. 
Board of Regents, 468 U.S. 85, 109-10 n.39, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1984). The ""quick look"" rule of reason analysis 
would permit the Court to examine the alleged restraints without defining the relevant market because market power is but ""a 
surrogate for detrimental effect."" See FTC v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 458-61, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 
445 (1986) (stating that ""no elaborate industry analysis is required"" to condemn direct restraint on output where evidence of 
actual adverse effects on competition is clear). This abbreviated analysis is appropriate only where ""an observer with even a 
rudimentary understanding of economics could conclude that the arrangements in question have an anticompetitive effect on 
customers and markets."" Cal. Dental Ass'n v. FTC, 526 U.S. 756, 770, 119 S. Ct. 1604, 143 L. Ed. 2d 935 (1999)."
509,13," Vertical price fixing is an agreement between actors at different market levels (e.g., supplier and distributor) establishing the 
resale price or range of prices for products and services. ABA Section of Antitrust Law, Antitrust Law Developments, 130 & 
n.738 (5th ed. 2002). "
511,14," In Monsanto, a case brought by a terminated distributor, the Supreme Court found sufficient direct evidence of an agreement 
between Monsanto and other distributors to maintain prices to create a jury issue. The direct evidence was: (1) threatening 
action by a Monsanto manager against other price cutters shortly after the plaintiff's termination, followed by the subsequent 
consent of one of those parties to maintain prices at suggested levels; (2) evidence of discussions between Monsanto and the 
plaintiff of other distributors' complaints and requests to keep prices up; (3) explicit threats to terminate the plaintiff unless prices 
were raised; and (4) a distributor-customer newsletter published just before the termination of the plaintiff which discussed 
Monsanto's efforts to ""get the 'market place in order.'"" Id. at 765-68. "
512,15," See, e.g., Ben Elfman & Son, Inc. v. Criterion Mills, Inc., 774 F. Supp. 683 (D. Mass. 1991). Plaintiff Ben Elfman & Sons, Inc. 
(""Elfman""), a price-cutter, expanded its operations into New York and New Jersey, where it competed with defendant Benj. 
Berman, Inc. (""Berman""), a large and long-standing distributor of defendant manufacturer Criterion Mills, Inc. (""Criterion""). Id. at 
685. Both distributors priced their products independently of Criterion, but Berman wanted Elfman to raise its prices and 
complained to Criterion: ""The problem [with Elfman's pricing] has escalated to a point beyond which we can tolerate. You do 
what you must, we'll do what we must."" Id. at n.6. Criterion terminated Elfman's distributorship. Id. Elfman alleged essentially that Berman ""set a level of prices which Criterion asked Elfman, another distributor, to meet."" Id. at 
686. The court found that Elfman presented insufficient evidence to show an agreement between Criterion and Berman as to "
513,," Berman's resale prices or price levels. Id. Also, the court explained that the only inference that it could draw from Elfman's 
evidence was not an inference of a price-fixing agreement, but simply that Criterion preferred Berman's business (and prices) to 
Elfman's. Id. As such, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants. Id. at 687. The reasoning of Elfman is applicable here: When one distributor threatens or complains to a manufacturer about continuing to 
deal with a discounter, and the manufacturer independently determines that it would be more beneficial to keep the non-price 
cutting distributor, there is insufficient evidence of a Section 1 conspiracy."
513,16," Even if the Court found that the defendants had agreed to terminate C2C because of its price-cutting tactics, that alone would 
not suffice to establish a Section 1 violation. An agreement between a manufacturer and a dealer to terminate another dealer 
because it is a price cutter is insufficient to establish an antitrust violation. The violation only exists when the manufacturer and 
dealer agree on the resale price or price level that the dealer is to charge customers. Business Electronics, 485 U.S. at 726-27."
513,17," Although C2C includes a Section 1 claim under the rule of reason analysis in its complaint (Compl., at P72), C2C failed to 
either: (1) provide a rule of reason argument in its brief or reply brief, and (2) argue this point at oral argument. (See dkt. entry 
no. 17.) "
514,18," As the defendants admit, the April 2004 semi-exclusive distributorship agreement included an agreement that Wu Mar would 
not sell cranes to C2C if Coastal sold the cranes to distributors. As such, C2C has introduced sufficient evidence that the 
defendants agreed to a vertical non-price restraint -- restricting to whom C2C could sell Wu Mar cranes. "
515,19," C2C argues that Wu Mar cranes are the relevant product market in the context of its Section 2 violation claim. However, 
because the rule of reason analysis requires the Court to determine the relevant product market, C2C's contentions are 
analyzed here."
515,20," The Court, although the defendants did not claim as such, assumes for purposes of this opinion that the defendants are 
equally opposed to Maurer's ""opinions"". "
516,21," Some courts find that expert testimony is necessary. See, e.g., Morgan, Strand, Wheeler & Biggs v. Radiology, Ltd., 924 F.2d 
1484, 1490 (9th Cir. 1991) (concluding that principals in case were not experts ""qualified to opine on a highly technical economic 
question[,]"" i.e. the definition of the relevant product market); Berlyn, Inc. v. Gazette Newsp., 223 F.Supp.2d 718, 727 & n.3 (D. 
Md. 2002) (stating that ""to prove [the] relevant market, expert testimony is of utmost importance, and that testimony, or any other 
evidence, must be based on specific facts pertaining to the proposed market""); Va. Vermiculite, Ltd. v. W.R. Grace & Co., 108 
F.Supp.2d 549, 576 n.16 (W.D. Va. 2000) (explaining expert testimony practically necessary for market definition). Other courts 
have held that expert testimony is not required to define the relevant product market. Cf. Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & 
Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 242, 113 S. Ct. 2578, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1993) (""Expert testimony is useful as a guide 
to interpreting market facts, but it is not a substitute for them.""); see, e.g., Anti-Monopoly, Inc. v. Hasbro, Inc., 958 F.Supp. 895, 
904 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (""Experts are not always essential to defining the relevant market[.]"")."

market."" Domed Stadium Hotel v. Holiday Inns, 732 F.2d 480, 488 (5th Cir. 1984); accord Grappone, Inc. v. Subaru of New 
England, 858 F.2d 792, 797 (1st Cir. 1988); Mozart Co. v. Mercedes-Benz of N. Am., 833 F.2d 1342, 1346-47 (9th Cir. 1987);

517,23," C2C cites to Fineman v. Armstrong World Industries, Inc., 980 F.2d 171, 199 (3d Cir. 1992), for the proposition that ""in 
some instances one brand of a product can constitute a separate market."" After reviewing Fineman, the Court believes that C2C 
has improperly cited Fineman, and actually intended to cite the Supreme Court's decision in Kodak, which rejected the 
contention that a single brand of a product or service can never be a relevant market. As such, we will address C2C's claim as 
referring to the Supreme Court's determination in Kodak. "
518,24," NJAA § 56:9-4 is also interpreted in accordance with federal case law interpreting Section 2. NJAA § 56:9-4 provides, in 
relevant part: HN15[
] ""It shall be unlawful for any person to monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or to combine or conspire 
with any person or persons, to monopolize trade or commerce in any relevant market."" Id. This language essentially mirrors the 
language of Section 2."
518,25," ""Monopoly power under § 2 requires . . . something greater than market power under § 1."" Kodak, 504 U.S. at 481. 
Nonetheless, the analysis to define relevant markets is similar -- relevant markets under both sections are defined by the same 
two factors: ""reasonable interchangeability of use and cross-elasticities of demand."" Queen City Pizza, 124 F.3d at 442 (internal 
citations omitted). "
522,26, C2C has not brought a claim for breach of contract against Wu Mar.
522,27," The defendants' contention that C2C delayed in seeking injunctive relief is unsupported by the evidence. ""Delay is relevant in 
assessing irreparable harm, and that a preliminary injunction may be an inappropriate remedy where the non-movant provides 
proof of the movant's unexplained delay."" Pharmacia Corp. v. GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare, L.P., 292 F.Supp.2d 611, 
622 (D.N.J. 2003) (citations and quotations omitted). Here, however, following Wu Mar's refusal to provide C2C with cranes, 
C2C and Coastal engaged in discussions involving, inter alia, C2C purchasing Wu Mar cranes through Coastal. After those 
discussions fell apart, C2C did not delay in seeking injunctive relief."
522,28," The Court is not required to issue findings regarding the balance of the hardships and the public interest when the party 
seeking a preliminary injunction does not establish both a reasonable likelihood of success and irreparable harm. See, e.g., 
Reebok Int'l Ltd. v. J. Baker, Inc., 32 F.3d 1552, 1556 (Fed. Cir. 1994). "
523,29," C2C has not indicated that Feiloli (or any other foreign crane manufacturer), the manufacturer of the alternative cranes (which 
C2C purchases for a substantially lower price than Wu Mar's cranes), is unwilling or unable to design the alternative cranes to 
meet C2C's needs. "
531,1," A temporary concurrency ordinance, ordinance 385, adopted on May 15, 2000, was soon replaced with a permanent 
ordinance, ordinance 400, which was then replaced with ordinance 415, which imposed similar requirements. Theoretically, a 
concurrency law is intended to require ""a developer applying for a building permit [to] show the local governing body that the 
demands of the proposed development will not exceed the maximum capacity of public facilities."" Adam Strachan, Note, 
Concurrency Laws: Water as a Land-Use Regulation, 21 J. Land Res. & Envtl. L. 435, 435 (2001)."
531,2," The complaint also alleged violations of Article I, Sections 7 and 24 of the Utah Constitution and the Due Process and Equal 
Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution. The district court granted the Summit Water appellants' motion for partial 
summary judgment on their due process claims in May 2002. In so doing, the court declared unconstitutional county ordinances 
400 and 415, which had imposed requirements on developers to form agreements with water companies having sufficient water 
concurrency ratings. The court reasoned that an appearance of unfairness arose from the facts that the ordinances designated 
the Board of County Commissioners--also Mountain Regional's governing board--as the body hearing appeals of water 
concurrency ratings, and that Jarvis was the County's concurrency officer as well as a Mountain Regional employee. The district 
court's May 2002 order is not before us on appeal. According to the County appellees, the County has since revised its 
ordinance to designate a state district engineer as the concurrency officer and to remove the county commission from the appeal 
process. Summit Water's challenge to its concurrency rating under the new ordinance is on appeal in a separate action, Summit 
Water Distrib. Co v. Mountain Regional Water Special Serv. Dist, 2005 UT App 66, 108 P.3d 119. "
532,3," As quoted by the district court, Senator Waddingham stated that one of the reasons is the legislation we passed two years ago dealing with [the Intermountain Power Project]. And a recent 
federal case, that I have not read, but which has been called to my attention, that in some cases makes municipalities 
comply with certain sections of the federal antitrust legislation. This--one of the purposes, which I hope that this particular 
amendment would accomplish was to remove any question as to whether or not its' [sic] at variance with the Interlocal 
Cooperation Act that we passed two years ago. Floor Debate, 43rd Utah Leg., Gen. Sess., Feb. 5, 1979 (statement of Sen. Waddingham). "
536,4," In one treatise author's opinion, ""because issues concerning what a statute means or what a legislature intended are 
essentially issues of fact, even though they are decided by the judge and not by a jury, a court should never exclude relevant 
and probative evidence from consideration."" 2A Norman J. Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction § 45:02, at 14-15 (6th ed. 
2000). "
537,5," By referring to such a ""policy,"" we express no opinion on the question of whether Article XII, Section 20 is self-executing. "
538,6," Our conclusion here is not inconsistent with our refusal above to interpret the term ""municipality"" to include all units of local 
government in accord with the federal state action exemption. As we explained above, federal antitrust law does not ascribe a 
unique meaning to the word ""municipality."" In contrast, City of Lafayette used the phrase, ""authorized or directed,"" in the course 
of setting forth a distinct legal standard. The latter phrase, therefore, does have a unique meaning in federal antitrust law. 
Moreover, the implication of our holding is that the Utah Legislature simply imported the exemption recognized in City of 
Lafayette into the Utah Antitrust Act rather than trying to avoid the federal law, as the County appellees have argued."
538,7," The County appellees bolster their argument that the Utah Legislature was ""actively hostile"" to the Court's rulings in City of 
Lafayette and City of Boulder by reference to its enactment of section 76-10-919(4) and (5), which prohibits damage awards "
539,," against political subdivisions that violate the Antitrust Act. Utah Code Ann. § 76-10-919(4), (5). As the County appellees note, 
this provision mirrors the federal statute enacted by Congress in 1984, which similarly bars damage awards against local 
governments. Local Government Antitrust Act of 1984, 15 U.S.C. §§ 35-36. In our view, the Legislature's passage of section 76-
10-919 is simply another example of its close adherence to federal antitrust law. This strengthens our conclusion that the 
""authorized or directed"" language in section 76-10-915(1)(f) was similarly intended to parallel federal law. Moreover, while the 
County appellees maintain that the Supreme Court's decisions caused ""considerable consternation"" in Congress and that it was 
this ""aversion"" to the Supreme Court's decisions that led to the passage of the Local Government Antitrust Act and to section 76-
10-919, it seems significant that neither Congress nor the Utah Legislature simply declared all local governmental entities 
exempt from antitrust laws in these provisions. Their actions in limiting monetary damages while failing to grant a complete 
exemption appears to signal acquiescence in, and possibly even approval of, the idea that local governments may have to 
comply with orders of injunctive relief if their anticompetitive actions violate antitrust provisions. "
540,8," The parties cite to the version of CLUDMA in effect at the time they submitted their briefs. See Utah Code Ann. §§ 17-27-101 to 
-1003 (2001 & Supp. 2004) (repealed 2005). In the 2005 legislative session, the Act was renumbered and revised. See Utah 
Code Ann. §§ 17-27a-101 to -803 (Supp. 2005). While generally we consider the law in effect at the time a claim arises or is 
brought in court, see State v. One Lot of Pers. Prop., 2004 UT 36, PP13-17, 90 P.3d 639, current law is relevant when injunctive 
relief is requested, see Nat'l Coalition to Save Our Mall v. Norton, 348 U.S. App. D.C. 92, 269 F.3d 1092, 1096-97 (D.C. Cir. 
2001) (citing Miller v. French, 530 U.S. 327, 120 S. Ct. 2246, 147 L. Ed. 2d 326 (2000)). Because injunctive relief is requested 
here, we consider the current version of the CLUDMA in our analysis. "
542,9," We note, however, that anticompetitive effects resulting from activities that any of the County appellees undertake in the 
ordinary course of performing their authorized duties, where there are no uncontemplated ties between county and special 
service district functions, might be considered foreseeable. Moreover, we recognize that the Court in City of Columbia rejected a 
""conspiracy"" exception to the municipality exemption. 499 U.S. at 379 (refusing to ""allow plaintiffs to look behind the actions of 
state sovereigns to base their claims on 'perceived conspiracies to restrain trade'"" and reaffirming that, ""with the possible market 
participant exception, any action that qualifies as state action"" under the foreseeability test is ""exempt from the operation of the 
antitrust laws"")."
542,10," Because we conclude that the actions alleged by the Summit Water appellants are not ""authorized or directed by state law"" 
under section 76-10-915(1)(f), we need not address the Summit Water appellants' additional argument that the municipality 
exemption does not apply to the County appellees because they are acting as market participants. As noted above, City of 
Columbia left open the question of whether the municipality exemption would apply when the municipality is acting as a market 
participant. 499 U.S. at 379. Further, the Summit Water appellants' claim that Senator Waddingham's affidavit was 
inappropriately excluded is moot under our conclusion here. "
547,1," Specifically, Goss alleges infringement of United States Patent Nos. 6,374,734 (the 734 patent), 6,386,100 (the 100 patent), 
and 6,739,251 (the 251 patent)."
547,2," By order dated April 4, 2005 (see document no. 30), the caption of this case was amended to list Goss as the plaintiff, to reflect 
the corporate name change resulting from the August 2004 transaction. "
548,3," In its reply to MAN Roland's objection to the motion to dismiss, Heidelberger AG incorrectly argues that MAN Roland's fifth 
counterclaim is premised on the August 2004 transaction. MAN Roland broadly characterizes Heidelberger AG's anticompetitive 
conduct as ""committing fraud on the [Patent Office] in order to secure the patent-in-suit and then bringing baseless lawsuit-sham 
litigation-in order to enforce those patents which they know to be unenforceable."" (Corrected Countercl. Pl.'s Mem. in Opp'n to 
Mot. to Dismiss at 5.) "
604,1," Plaintiff clearly alleges maximum price-fixing, which is setting the maximum price that can be charged for a product. It is 
unclear whether Plaintiff alleges vertical maximum price-fixing or horizontal maximum price-fixing. The importance of the 
distinction is discussed below. "
605,2," HN13[
] Courts use the terms ""contract"" ""combination"" and ""conspiracy"" interchangeably to describe an agreement between 
two or more actors to restrain trade. Todorov v. DCH Healthcare Auth., 921 F.2d 1438, 1455 (11th Cir. 1991)."
605,3," Plaintiff must also prove that the conspiracy affects interstate commerce. 15 U.S.C. § 1. The Court assumes without deciding 
that the interstate commerce element is met."
605,4," Toscano addressed conduct evaluated under the Rule of Reason standard. HN15[
] When conduct that is per se illegal is alleged, a contract alone ""may give rise to an inference of concerted action under § 1 if the agreement was part of a tying 
arrangement."" 70 F. Supp. 2d at 1115 n.6. The contracts between the contractors and Defendants in the present case do not 
raise a genuine issue of material fact as to concerted action for three reasons. First, the Rule of Reason applies to the alleged 
price-fixing conspiracy, as will be discussed below. Second, Plaintiff does not allege that the contracts are tying agreements. 
Third, even if the per se illegality rule applied, the Matsushita standard is applicable. There must be stronger evidence of 
concerted action to fix prices than mere inferences because the alleged conspiracy does not make economic sense. "
607,5," The relevant geographic and product markets are assumed to be the market for solar water heaters as a substitute for 
conventionally generated electrical power on the island of Kauai. "
608,6," The Court assumes, without deciding, that a Section 2 claim can be successfully alleged against entities, like Defendants, who 
are not direct participants in the relevant product market. Defendants have never directly sold or directly profited from the sale of

624,1," The five studio defendants are Paramount, Disney, Columbia TriStar, Universal, and Twentieth Century Fox. Three others 
(Warner, a Warner affiliate, and MGM) settled with plaintiffs and were dismissed from the case in May 2002. "
625,2," The studios' 40 percent share was a lower percentage than the studios received in their cherry-pick revenue sharing on 
selected titles with distributor Rentrak."
625,3," Blockbuster spent $ 50 million testing copy depth in selected cities and learned that a substantial increase in copy depth could 
generate an increase in rentals. "
626,4," It is undisputed that the different revenue-sharing programs Blockbuster negotiated with the studios were business-justified, 
commercial arrangements entered into by the parties acting in their perceived economic self-interest."
626,5," The request of the studio defendants to take judicial notice of the Fifth Circuit's unpublished opinion in Cleveland v. Viacom 
Inc., supra, 73 Fed. Appx. 736, is granted. We also grant Eddins's motion for judicial notice of several other documents filed in 
Cleveland v. Viacom Inc., including the plaintiffs' petition for rehearing and the Fifth Circuit's denial of the petition. "
627,6," The plaintiffs sought class certification only with respect to the price fixing claim, asserting that the alleged price fixing conduct 
was a per se violation of both the Cartwright Act and the unfair competition law. This court deferred consideration of the appeal 
plaintiffs filed from the trial court's ruling denying class certification, and that appeal will become moot upon the finality of this 
decision."
627,7," Blockbuster and the studio defendants also sought summary judgment on res judicata and collateral estoppel grounds. The 
trial court rejected these grounds, finding that, while the claims were the same as those litigated to finality in the Texas action, 
privity did not exist between the California plaintiffs and the Texas plaintiffs. The defendants do not challenge the trial court's 
ruling on this issue. "
628,8," The studio executives described, for example, the background in the industry and the negotiations with Blockbuster, often 
protracted and difficult, as the studios sought to ensure they would derive at least as much revenue as under traditional pricing. 
Each executive asserted his or her studio acted independently and at no time conferred or agreed with any other studio about 
the terms of its deal, and did not agree with Blockbuster or each other to deny comparable terms to wholesale distributors. They 
also asserted their belief that distributors and small retailers generally were not interested in output revenue sharing because 
they did not want to commit to purchase all the studio's titles; described their various dealings with distributors and independent 
retailers to expand “cherry-pick” revenue sharing; and described the other programs they devised to achieve copy depth for 
independent retailers who could not or did not wish to participate in long-term output revenue sharing."
628,9," An assertion that the trier of fact might disbelieve any denial of an unlawful conspiracy by Blockbuster and the studios is not 
sufficient. (Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 852.) "
629,10," “Tacit collusion, sometimes called oligopolistic price coordination or conscious parallelism, describes the process, not in itself 
unlawful, by which firms in a concentrated market might in effect share monopoly power, setting their prices at a profit-
maximizing, supracompetitive level by recognizing their shared economic interests and their interdependence with respect to 
price and output decisions.” (Brooke Group, supra, 509 U.S. at p. 227.)"
629,11," In addition to acts against self-interest, another “plus factor” is evidence implying a traditional conspiracy—“conspiratorial 
opportunity, unexplained meetings, furtive behavior, discussions and information exchanges, ambiguous participant admissions, 
solicitations of agreement, sham bids, threats of common action directed against a potential victim, identical bids, refusals to bid, 
proved conspiracy or competition in other markets or times, or other parallelism that is too close for coincidence and beyond 
explanation by mere recognized interdependence.” (6 Areeda, Antitrust Law, supra, ch. 14, ¶ 1434b.) Except for evidence that 
the studios were generally aware of the terms of the other studios' deals with Blockbuster and distributors—information they 
obtained from their customers, not from each other—there is no evidence remotely similar to any of these types in this case. "
630,12," In April 2000, Fox and Rentrak (the distributor which had “cherry-pick” revenue-sharing agreements with the studios for 
independent retailers since 1992) made a deal that included an output revenue-sharing option, and in March 2001, Universal 
and Rentrak did so. The Fox and Universal agreements with Rentrak did not require the independent retailer to commit to 
purchase a studio's output on a long-term basis; the term in each case was one year."
630,13," The “overflow[ing]” studio files cited in Eddins's brief include: (1) evidence Blockbuster informed each studio about the deals it 
proposed to or obtained from other studios; (2) several documents showing the studios knew the general terms of each others' 
deals with distributors; (3) the studios' admissions that they routinely obtained, through retailers and distributors, each other's 
current pricing and contract terms; and (4) the presence in Fox files of a copy of the Blockbuster/Disney agreement and a Fox 
analysis of the Disney deal. The second category includes (a) a January 26, 1998 memo from Warner's files on Blockbuster's 
revenue-sharing proposal—predating Warner's own agreement with Blockbuster—which compares Warner's current and 
Disney's proposed revenue-sharing options through distributors; (b) a Fox document showing the terms of Disney deals and "
631,," proposed deals with two distributors, Blockbuster, and Hollywood; and (c) a February 1998 Disney presentation to wholesalers, 
found in Universal's files, including a page describing Disney's proposed distributor revenue-sharing deal terms. None of this 
evidence suggests consciously parallel determinations not to offer Blockbuster-comparable terms to distributors for independent 
retailers. "
632,14," The testimony from studio executives relied upon by Eddins includes, for example, Columbia's Robin Russell replying 
affirmatively to the question, “Would you have loved to have all of these independent dealers committed to take all of your 
output?” Disney's Michael Johnson and Universal's Craig Kornblau gave testimony to the same effect. The studios' economic 
expert, Professor Klein, was asked if it was in the studios' economic interest to offer comparable revenue-sharing agreements to 
distributors, and answered: “Yes. In general. I mean different studios found it in their interest to have different arrangements, 
both with Blockbuster and with the independents, but yes, it was in their economic interest; their individual economic interest.”"
632,15," The statement was in a Fox document dated February 3, 1998, updating the status of negotiations with Blockbuster."
632,16," The document, dated April 30, 1998, states it is essential to provide revenue-sharing options to independent retailers and lists 
six reasons for doing so, including the one stated in the text. Another reason stated is the mitigation of price discrimination 
complaints. "
633,17," The document was an undated report reviewing the state of the video rental industry through 1998. The same document 
identified, as “issues” for Universal, that revenue sharing was “[d]riving rapid consolidation of retail business,” “[m]ay not be 
practical for all retailers” and involved “[c]omplex administration and collection requirements.”"
633,18," This document on Universal's rental strategy describes the state of the industry, and also observes that copy depth programs 
were initiated primarily as a way for distribution to service smaller second and third tier rental retailers to combat direct revenue-
sharing programs."
633,19," This third Universal document recounts the increase in Blockbuster's market share at the expense of the independent 
retailers, and also lists the issues facing smaller retailers, including that the smaller retailer may not be able to effectively handle 
additional product due to space limitations, adequate systems for monitoring are required, and the fact that the retailer must buy 
the studio's entire output, including nontheatrical releases. "
635,20," HN5[
] A defendant's “economic self-interest” refers to “what that defendant's legitimate economic self-interest would be 
under the assumption that it acted alone … .” (City of Tuscaloosa, supra, 158 F.3d at p. 570, fn. 33.) That is, the plaintiff “must 
establish that each defendant would have acted unreasonably in a business sense if it had engaged in the challenged conduct 
unless that defendant had received assurances from the other defendants that they would take the same action.” (Bolt v. Halifax 
Hosp. Medical Center (11th Cir. 1990) 891 F.2d 810, 826–827.)"
635,21," Eddins cites City of Tuscaloosa, supra, 158 F.3d 548. However, the case is not helpful to Eddins, as it, too, demonstrates by 
contrast the deficiency in Eddins's evidence. In City of Tuscaloosa, Alabama municipal entities alleged that defendant chemical 
companies engaged in a conspiracy to fix prices for repackaged chlorine, allocate customers or markets, and rig bids. The court 
observed that: “Oligopolists behaving in a legal, consciously parallel fashion could achieve high and rising prices, even as costs 
remained stable, by engaging in price leadership. [Citation.] The odds that they could achieve a price and profit increase and 
maintain incredibly high incumbency rates—that is, maintain the very same distribution of municipal contracts year after year—
are minuscule, however, unless the oligopolists were communicating with one another. In sum, this combination of high profits 
and high incumbency would not be likely to occur if the defendants either were vigorously competing with each other or were 
engaging in competitive price leadership. It would be permissible for a jury to find, therefore, that the defendants were not in fact 
competing for [municipal] contracts but were concertedly protecting each others' incumbencies and pushing up prices.” (City of 
Tuscaloosa, supra, 158 F.3d at pp. 572–573, fns. omitted.) In this case, there was no comparable combination of events or 
occurrences for which the odds were “miniscule,” or that were in any way unlikely or inexplicable in the absence of a conspiracy. "
636,22," The evidence Eddins cites for its contention the studios would not favor Blockbuster, without an understanding that the other 
studios would do the same, does not suggest any agreement on withholding favorable terms from independent retailers. Eddins 
cites two studio documents from Warner, a nondefendant. One of them is a January 1998 report analyzing Blockbuster's 
proposal for output revenue sharing during Warner's negotiations with Blockbuster, and the other is a May 27, 1997 outline 
analyzing and rejecting an earlier Blockbuster proposal for price concessions apparently unrelated to revenue sharing. The 
documents are addressed to the risks of entering revenue-sharing agreements with (or providing price concessions requested 
by) Blockbuster, not to the risks (or advantages) of refusing to provide those terms to others. One of the risks of a Blockbuster 
agreement was that the studio's other customers would shift business to studios which were not revenue sharing with their 
largest competitor. The May 1997 document was created well before any output revenue-sharing agreements were executed or 
anticipated, and evidences nothing other than ordinary competitive analysis. It is difficult to see how any inference of collusion 
could conceivably be drawn from either document."
636,23," Eddins also cited one other item: a chart prepared by Sweeney, comparing the average price Blockbuster paid to each studio 
defendant and the average price paid by distributors, with Blockbuster's average price ranging from $ 18.69 to $ 26.39, and the 
“all distribution” average price ranging from $ 41.74 to $ 48.27. While this chart shows that Blockbuster's average price per tape 
was less than that paid by distributors, that is hardly surprising given the different terms on which each were purchasing. The 
pertinent question is whether those different terms were the result of a conspiracy; the fact that the terms were different does not 
assist in that inquiry. "
637,24," In its brief, but not in its separate statement, Eddins also cites an excerpt from the report of another economic expert who 
testified on damages in the Texas trial, Dr. Jeffrey Leitzinger. Leitzinger concluded that the studios' revenue gains from the 
Blockbuster deals “more than offset the loss in revenue from independent retailers.” Eddins does not give Leitzinger's sources 
for this conclusion, and it is settled that an expert's report—much less an excerpt from an expert's report—“cannot be used to 
prove the existence of facts set forth therein.” (In re Citric Acid Litigation (9th Cir. 1999) 191 F.3d 1090, 1102.)"
637,25," The Fifth Circuit determined that Sweeney's testimony was based in part on the simplistic assumption that, because the 
studios received greater revenues under their deals with Blockbuster, they also would have received greater revenues under 
similar deals with distributors serving independents, an approach which “ignores significant differences between independent 
retailers and large chains such as Blockbuster.” (Cleveland v. Viacom Inc., supra, 73 Fed. Appx. at pp. 740–741.) "
638,26," The court in In re Flat Glass Antitrust Litigation (3d Cir. 2004) 385 F.3d 350, 360–361 (Flat Glass) observes that the “plus” 
factors of motive and actions contrary to economic interest, in the context of a price-fixing conspiracy, are relevant, but since 
they often restate the ordinary concept of interdependence in an oligopolistic market, “they may not suffice—by themselves—to 
defeat summary judgment on a claim of horizontal price-fixing among oligopolists.”"
638,27," In contrast with the case at bar, a case illustrating probative evidence of pretext is JTC Petroleum Co. v. Piasa Motor Fuels, 
Inc. (7th Cir. 1999) 190 F.3d 775, 779. The evidence of pretext in JTC Petroleum is clear, and is used only in combination with 
other probative evidence of a conspiracy. In JTC Petroleum, the plaintiff, a road repair contractor, brought an antitrust suit 
against its competitors (the applicator defendants) and asphalt producers (the producer defendants). The producers settled. JTC 
tried to show that the applicators enlisted the producers in their conspiracy, “assigning them the role of policing the applicators' 
cartel by refusing to sell to applicators who defied the cartel—such as JTC, which has bid for jobs that the cartel had assigned to 
other applicators.” (Id. at p. 778.) Since the producers had nowhere else to sell their asphalt, the applicator defendants could 
“coerce them into helping to police their cartel by threatening to buy less product from them or pay less for it,” or may have been 
paying the producers rather than coercing them. (Ibid.) The court observed there was also evidence “that the reasons the 
producers gave for refusing to sell to JTC were pretextual … .” (Id. at p. 779.) For example, the producers said they refused to 
sell to JTC because it was not a good credit risk. However, when JTC offered to pay cash, the producers still refused to sell. 
“This suggests that the real reason for the refusal was … that they were being compensated by the cartel for refusing to sell to a 
customer whom otherwise they would have been happy to sell to.” (Ibid.) “Given the evidence of cartelization at both the 
applicator and producer level, the suspicious producer price behavior (suggestive of the producers' having been ‘paid off’ by the 
cartel to boycott JTC and other upstarts), and the pretextual character of the reasons the producers gave for the refusal to deal, 
a rational jury could conclude that JTC was indeed the victim of a producers' boycott organized by the applicator defendants.” 
(Ibid.) "
639,28," This evidence, Eddins says, contradicts the studios' claim they did not offer Blockbuster terms to independent retailers 
because distributors and independents did not want them, and is a part of the evidence of pretext."
639,29," The evidence that Blockbuster asked Fox not to give the same terms to independents is found in the deposition testimony of 
John Caesar, an independent retailer who testified that Don Jeffries of Fox said that “Blockbuster wanted a special deal and that 
they did not want it to be offered to independents.” Eddins's evidence also showed that Fox would not agree to offer exclusive 
terms to Blockbuster."
639,30," For example, Disney’s Michael Johnson explained that Disney focused its revenue-sharing efforts on large chain retailers, 
because “[t]hey would be more likely to have the internal distribution facilities and financial reporting software required to make 
revenue sharing work.” Disney concluded that the small independent video retailers generally were not interested in revenue 
sharing on an output basis because they did not want to have to commit to purchase all of Disney’s video releases, preferring to 
cherry pick which to purchase based on what they believed would rent best in their local markets. Johnson also cited a lack of "
640,," technology to support the software necessary for revenue sharing and a disinclination to share business information with others 
as reasons independents were not interested in output revenue-sharing deals. The declaration of Universal’s William P. Clark 
also cited unwillingness to pay the guarantees that Blockbuster agreed to pay. Eric Doctorow of Paramount observed that 
Paramount’s discussions with Ingram and other wholesale distributors encountered the obstacle of lack of adequate reporting 
and tracing systems, and distributors’ reports of lack of demand sufficient to justify the expense of developing, buying or 
licensing the necessary systems.  Declarations from other studio executives, while different in details, were comparable."
640,31," Revenue sharing, unlike traditional purchasing, requires that all rental transactions at the retail level be tracked and accounted 
for in order to accomplish an accurate split between the studio and the customer."
640,32," Ingram's testimony is not as straightforward as Eddins suggests. Ingram testified that his company asked the studios to 
provide it the best possible revenue-sharing terms and the most choices and variety possible. “And clearly, if there were terms 
being offered to large retailers on a direct basis, we would try to most closely duplicate that for our dealers … .” When Ingram 
was asked if he asked studios to provide him output revenue-sharing agreements, he answered: “I don't know what was asked 
of the studios beyond we were asking for the best possible deals for our dealers.” When Ingram was asked, “So is it your 
testimony that you wanted both output and nonoutput agreements?”, his answer was: “I think that is accurate, yes, that we 
wanted maximum flexibility for our dealers.” Ingram was then asked if that was because his dealers were requesting those 
agreements, and he answered: “Our dealers were requesting to have revenue-sharing programs with maximum flexibility.”"
640,33," The evidence consists of three defense exhibits from the Texas trial relating to Rentrak's negotiations with Fox: (1) An August 
3, 1998 letter to Fox (Pat Wyatt) from Marty Graham at Rentrak, with Rentrak's thoughts on the fee structure Fox should 
consider in exchange for a retailer's commitment to acquire 100 percent of its output on a revenue-sharing basis, and the 
comment that “there is a strong economic incentive for the retailer to shift his/her purchasing to the output agreement terms—
exactly what we expect a majority of our retail customers to do”; (2) an August 21, 1998 letter from Rentrak to Fox, reporting that 
Rentrak has amended the terms of one of its supplier agreements to include an output option for retailers, and enclosing a 
summary of key terms, which included a one-year term for the output option; and (3) a letter of April 8, 1999 from Rentrak to Fox 
enclosing an “output” analysis and stating that the terms would generate 70 percent more margin dollars for Fox, from retailers 
willing to enter into output agreements, and that smaller retailers needed an output option that would enable them to more 
effectively compete with the biggest retail chains."
640,34," Webb testified that at the spring 1999 meeting of the IVRG, he asked Jeffries of Fox, on behalf of the IVRG, for the same 
terms Blockbuster had. A declaration from Webb also enclosed a June 5, 1998 letter he wrote to all the major studios, asking 
them to extend to all video retailers “prices, terms, and conditions that will eliminate any discrimination or unfair advantages,” 
including “any term that Blockbuster or others might be receiving that we are not.” Eddins cites a February 25, 1999 letter from "
641,," Webb to Columbia, expressing the appreciation of the IVRG for a February 11, 1999 meeting, and stating Webb had begun the 
process of collecting data from IVRG members. Eddins also cites the testimony of Robin Russell of Columbia about the same 
meeting, explaining that the IVRG “thought they wanted the quote, unquote Blockbuster deal,” and “came to us to discuss the 
possibility of creating a buying group, so they would be large enough to enter into a direct relationship.”"
641,35," Eddins points to another document, an October 30, 1997 Disney memo from Michael Johnson to Michael Eisner, reporting 
that Disney was planning to adopt the revenue-sharing model. Eddins points to one sentence in this memo: “Blockbuster 
represents 20–25% of the rental business and we hope to roll this out to a few other key retailers representing another 15–20%.” 
According to Eddins, we may infer from this sentence that Disney agreed with Blockbuster to withhold those terms from the 
remaining 55 percent of the market. To draw such an inference, however, would be pure conjecture. The statement is entirely 
consistent with an independent decision to try a new business model on the segment of the market—large chains—with which it 
was most likely to be successful. "
642,36," The trial court did not err in excluding Ingram Entertainment's strategic plans for 1999, 2000 and 2001. The strategic plans 
were not admissible under the business records exception to the hearsay rule.HN9[
]  A business record is “a writing made as 
a record of an act, condition, or event,” and may be used to prove the “act, condition, or event” if certain conditions are met. The 
conditions include requirements that the record was made “in the regular course of a business;” “at or near the time of the act, 
condition, or event;” and the “sources of information and method and time of preparation were such as to indicate its 
trustworthiness.” (Evid. Code, § 1271.) We doubt that a strategic plan—containing observations about industry developments, 
and opinions and statements of past actions and future plans—may be considered a “record of an act, condition, or event” within 
the meaning of the business record exception to the hearsay rule. (See People v. Campos (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 304, 309–310 
[38 Cal. Rptr. 2d 113] [reports of nontestifying medical experts and probation report were not admissible as business records 
because they were records of conclusions, not an “ ‘act, condition, or event’ ”].) Moreover, the plans in this case do not meet the 
trustworthiness requirement of the rule. As Ingram himself testified: “Clearly, we are trying to write an accurate plan with 
accurate information in it, but there is no assurance that the information in the plan is accurate, and in some cases information in 
the plan might be more on the case of speculation or best guess … .” Eddins's further argument that the business plans were 
admissible to show “operative facts, notice, knowledge and state of mind” is likewise without merit. "
643,37," As Aguilar noted, “ ‘[a]ssessing the sufficiency of the evidence to determine whether a reasonable juror could find that the 
plaintiff has satisfied his burden of persuasion’ ” is a traditional judicial function. (Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 856, fn. 26, 
quoting 2 Areeda and Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law (rev. ed. 1995) ¶ 322, p. 71.) "
645,38," Of course, it may well be that, if the same terms and conditions were offered to distributors, they would not have been 
accepted. However, that is not the question before us. "
646,39," In ABC Internat. Traders, supra, 14 Cal.4th at page 1264, the Supreme Court merely repeated its holding in Harris, supra, 
stating that: “We held [in Harris] section 17045 did not apply to advertising allowances allegedly granted to the competing "
647,," retailer, because the allowances were neither secret nor discriminatory, being available to all purchasers buying on like terms 
and conditions.” (ABC Internat. Traders, supra, 14 Cal.4th at p. 1264.) The court did not address the question whether 
advertising allowances were “rebates, refunds, commissions, or unearned discounts” (clause one) or “special services or 
privileges” (clause two). In G.H.I.I. v. MTS, Inc. (1983) 147 Cal. App. 3d 256 [195 Cal. Rptr. 211] (G.H.I.I.), the court rejected as 
specious the defendants' argument that plaintiffs “failed to plead that the ‘secret rebates’ were ‘not extended to all purchasers 
purchasing upon like terms and conditions’ … as section 17045 requires.” (Id. at p. 272, italics omitted.) The court observed the 
gravamen of plaintiffs' complaint was that they purchased on like terms and conditions, but were treated differently by 
distributors. Again, the court merely responded to an argument, and did not address the question whether “like terms and 
conditions” modifies the rebate clause. Moreover, the court pointed out that the plaintiffs alleged the existence of both secret 
prices and discounts and “financing arrangements and other special terms and services specified in the complaint which were 
not granted to” plaintiffs (id. at p. 264), thus implicating both clauses of the statute. Finally, in Uneedus v. California Shoppers, 
Inc. (1978) 86 Cal. App. 3d 932, 937 [150 Cal. Rptr. 596], the court made the general observation that the UPA “closely parallels 
the Robinson-Patman Act,” and that both proscribe three basic types of business practice: price discrimination in its various 
forms; sales below cost; and “the granting of rebates and discounts not made available to all buyers on like terms and 
conditions,” citing a law review article on the UPA. Again, the court had no occasion to address the question raised in this case. "
649,40," The jury instructions state that, to succeed with an affirmative defense that secret rebates are lawful because they apply to 
different classes of customers, the defendant must prove (1) that defendant “created different classes of customers,” such as 
wholesaler/retailer; (2) that “customers in the different classes performed different functions and assumed the risk, investment, 
and costs involved;” (3) that the difference in the rebate or discount “was given only in those sales where the favored buyer 
performed the function on which the claim of a different class is based;” and (4) that “the difference in price was reasonably 
related to the value of such function.? (CACI No. 3332.) "
650,41," E&H Wholesale, supra, 158 Cal. App. 3d 728, does not hold to the contrary. E&H Wholesale involved a suit by a wholesale 
distributor of cigarettes against two other wholesale distributors, alleging defendants gave secret rebates to selected customers, 
with the result that customers began purchasing from defendants rather than plaintiff. (Id. at pp. 730–732.) The court concluded 
the evidence did not support a finding that the secret rebates or discounts tended to destroy competition. Defendants gave the 
discounts to certain customers because the customers advised defendants of competitive offers from other distributors—in one 
case, from plaintiff—and the defendants met but did not exceed those offers. (Id. at pp. 738–739.) As the court concluded, “it is 
clear that discounts offered by [defendant to two customers] tended not to destroy competition, but rather, to meet the demands 
thereof, for in each instance, the discount was granted in order to meet offers made by competitors.” (Id. at p. 739.) The case 
does not involve any allegation of injury to competition in the secondary line of commerce (among the customers receiving the 
discount), but only in the primary line of commerce (between plaintiff and the defendants giving the discount). "
651,42," See also CACI No. 3333 [jury instruction on meeting competition as an affirmative defense to locality discrimination, below 
cost sales and loss leader sales claims]. No such instruction exists with respect to secret rebates. "
652,43," We express no opinion on whether evidence of a “knowing” inducement of an unearned discount is required to establish a 
violation of Business and Professions Code, section 17045 by the recipient. "
657,1," While plaintiffs initially sued fourteen defendants, on August 29, 2005, they voluntarily dismissed Total S.A., a French

659,4," In antitrust jurisprudence, courts use the adjective ""supracompetitive"" to mean above-competitive. See, e.g., Harrison Aire, Inc.

659,6," In interpreting Section 1's condemnation of agreements in restraint of trade, courts must reconcile the tension between two 
legal rules. The first requires courts to apply a simple, bright-line test (or ""per se"" rule) that focuses solely on whether certain 
conduct occurred. The second, in contrast, requires courts to use a multifactored reasonableness test (the ""rule of reason"") to 
measure the purpose and effect of challenged conduct. See Robert H. Bork, The Rule of Reason and the Per Se Concept: Price 
Fixing and Market Division (pt. 1), 74 Yale L.J. 775 (1965); Robert H. Bork, The Rule of Reason and the Per Se Concept: Price 
Fixing and Market Division (pt. 2), 75 Yale L.J. 373 (1966). While some cases suggest that these rules exist as binary opposites, 
others suggest that they represent the endpoints of a unified continuum. See Timothy J. Muris, California Dental Association v. 
Federal Trade Commission: The Revenge of Footnote 17, 8 Sup. Ct. Econ. Rev. 265, 304-06 (2000) (arguing that the ""supposed 
dichotomy"" between the per se rule and the rule of reason has been replaced with the ""rule of reason as a continuum""). Here, plaintiffs claim that defendants engaged in horizontal price-fixing: ""where competitors at the same market level agree to fix 
or control the prices they will charge for their respective goods or services."" In re: Flat Glass Antitrust Litig., 385 F.3d 350, 356 
(3d Cir. 2004) (quoting United States v. Brown Univ., 5 F.3d 658, 670 (3d Cir. 1993)). The Supreme Court has long held such 
restraints unreasonable per se. See, e.g., United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 224 n.59, 60 S. Ct. 811, 84 L. 
Ed. 1129 (1940); Flat Glass, 385 F.3d at 356. "
660,7," See also Leatherman v. Tarrant Cty. Narcotics Intelligence & Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 168, 113 S. Ct. 1160, 122 L. Ed. 
2d 517 (1993) (stating that a requirement of greater specificity for particular claims is a result ""that must be obtained by the 
process of amending the Federal Rules, and not by judicial interpretation""). Alternatively, if Congress saw a need to restrict 
antitrust class actions -- as it did with securities fraud class actions when it enacted the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act -- 
it could readily enact legislation that heightens the pleading standard in antitrust cases."
660,8," Or, to use the canon of statutory construction the Court used, ""Expresio unius est exclusio alterius."" Leatherman, 507 U.S. at 
168; see also Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 513. In other words, mention of one thing implies the exclusion of another. "
661,9," Defendants cite three cases from our Court of Appeals to suggest that district courts must apply a heightened pleading 
standard to antitrust complaints. None assists them. To the extent that Black & Yates, Inc. v. Mahogany Asso., 129 F.2d 227 (3d 
Cir. 1942) required plaintiffs to plead the facts underlying an alleged conspiracy, that holding was superseded decades later by 
Leatherman and Swierkiewicz. See also Fuentes, 946 F.2d at 202 (interpreting Black & Yates to require one to plead only the 
""conspiracy's participants, purpose, and motive . . . ."" and forgiving the plaintiffs for not alleging ""any meetings or phone calls at 
which the conspiracy was carried out. . . .""). Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ex rel. Zimmerman v. PepsiCo, Inc., 836 F.2d 173 (3d Cir. 1988) is equally unavailing. Like 
Black & Yates, PepsiCo also predated Leatherman, Swierkiewicz, and Fuentes. Even putting its timing aside, PepsiCo's facts 
distinguish it. In PepsiCo, our Court of Appeals wrote that its ""inquiry [was] confined to the single issue"" of whether the Drink 
Interbrand Competition Act of 1980 protected a consortium of soft drink manufacturers and bottlers from Section 1 liability for 
horizontally restraining trade. Id. at 178. Granted the court did require a heightened pleading standard, but it did so only 
""because the soft drink industry is involved . . . ."" Id. at 181 (emphasis added). Since this case involves hydrogen peroxide, not 
soda, it does not implicate the Soft Drink Act; hence, PepsiCo is inapposite. Last, although defendants do not much rely on it, we note that, unlike the plaintiffs in Garshman v. Universal Res. Holding, Inc., 
824 F.2d 223 (3d Cir. 1987), the plaintiffs here describe the conspiracy, identify the conspirators, and articulate anticompetitive 
effects. See id. at 230-31 (affirming a district court's Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of a Section 1 claim because the plaintiffs failed to 
describe a contract or conspiracy in restraint of trade, the defendants' co-conspirators, and any anticompetitive effects). 
Garshman requires nothing more. "
662,10," We also disagree with the argument advanced in defendants' reply memorandum that, if Rule 8(a) does apply, plaintiffs failed 
to satisfy it. Not only do plaintiffs lay the Fuentes foundation by describing the conspiracy's participants, purpose, and motive, but 
they also buttress it with specific allegations about the conspiracy's timing, mechanics, and effects. "
666,1," Plaintiffs' first amended complaint identified attorney Martin Dix as the individual who prepared the allegedly defamatory letter; 
however, Dix was not named as a Defendant. (Doc. 58, at 7-8)."
666,2," Plaintiffs' first amended complaint asserted defamation and trade libel, false light invasion of privacy, tortious interference with 
business relationships and business expectancies, malicious conspiracy, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade, and 
negligence claims against Defendants. "
667,3," Unlike Rules 7.1(A) and 7.1(C), Local Rule 7.1(B) does not contain a provision granting the court discretionary cause to grant 
or deny a motion. See generallyN.D. Fla. Local R. 7.1."
667,4," Plaintiffs accompanied their motion with a pleading indicating that, ""[a]s grounds for the filing of the proposed Second Amended 
Complaint . . . Plaintiffs include information from documentary discovery exchanged between the parties, as well as the filing of 
the Cross Claim by Florida Pharmacy Association."" (Doc. 103-1, at 2). Although Plaintiffs' pleading cites no authority other than 
the Scheduling Order providing for amendments to pleadings that must be made prior to October 1, 2005, and Rule 20 of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (doc. 103-1, at 2), a liberal construction of Plaintiffs' pleading might nonetheless result in a 
determination that Plaintiffs satisfied Local Rule 7.1(A). Regardless, this Court need not address the meaning of ""citation of 
authorities in support of the motion"" contained within Local Rule 7.1(A) at this time. "
668,5," Plaintiffs did, however, make some modifications. Firstly, Plaintiffs expanded upon underlying facts with additional background 
information obtained via ""documentary discovery exchanged between the parties."" (Doc. 103-1, at 2). Secondly, the allegedly 
defamatory letter, referred to as the ""Custom Care/FPA letter"" in the first amended complaint, has been renamed the ""Anazao 
Letter."" Thirdly, the negligence claim, previously listed as Count Six in the first amended complaint, has been moved to Count 
Five of the proposed second amended complaint. (Docs. 58, at 23-25; 103-2, at 33-34). Additionally, Plaintiffs removed 
demands for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief contained in the last paragraph of each count in the first amended 
complaint. (Docs. 58, at 18-25; 103-2, at 29-34)."
668,6," Plaintiffs, in fact, request that this Court rule on Defendants' motions ""in light of the proposed Second Amended Complaint, with 
the exception"" of the new count asserted against Anazao alleging DUTPA violations. (Doc. 103-1, at 2-3). "
669,7," Plaintiffs' first count alleging defamation satisfies this requirement. (Doc. 103-2, at 29)."
669,8," Plaintiffs have now alleged that Third-Party Defendant Marty Dix participated in the conspiracy against them. Compare doc. 77-
1, at 14 with doc. 103-2, at 4. "
671,9," Plaintiffs' proposed second amended complaint alleges that Katz Kutter and Dix were negligent irrespective of intent: ""The acts 
and omissions . . . are sufficient to hold Defendants liable in negligence irrespective of whether or not the wrongful conduct was 
malicious, reckless, knowing, or otherwise intentional."" (Doc. 103-2, at 36)."
671,10," Similarly, the second amended complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to demonstrate that Dix owed a duty of care to the 
Plaintiffs. "
673,11," The only difference between the two versions is that the proposed second amended complaint deletes the last sentence 
contained in the first amended complaint in which Plaintiffs sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief. (Doc. 58, at 20)."
673,12," Count Three of the proposed second amended complaint adds the following sentence: ""The dissemination of the Anazao 
Letter also resulted in the Plaintiffs failing to meet projected sales and profit targets, resulting in the loss of the opportunity to 
sale the barachytheraphy [sic] business entities to a specific identified buyer."" (Doc. 103-2, at 34). Plaintiffs also omitted from 
their proposed second amended complaint an entire paragraph found in the first amended complaint requesting compensatory 
damages, punitive damages, prejudgment interest, as well as preliminary and permanent injunctive relief. (Doc. 58, at 25). "
674,13," But see Callaway Land, 831 So. 2d at 210 (Gross, J., concurring specially) (noting that Orlando Sports is ""better understood 
as not allowing a plaintiff to use creative pleadings to bypass the notice requirement imposed by the legislature as a condition 
precedent to a libel action"")."
674,14," In fact, the Primerica court rejected arguments that the tortious interference claim at issue in that case was simply a disguised 
defamation claim by relying, in part, upon the fact that Florida law provides separate statute of limitations periods for each action. 
See 48 F. Supp. 2d at 1368. "
675,15," Anazao also argues that Plaintiffs failed to file a memorandum pursuant to Local Rule 7.1(A), which this Court addressed 
supra. "
676,16," The Jones court, however, cited Foman for its reference to ""undue delay"" as one of several factors that a district court may 
consider when denying leave to amend a pleading. See Jones, 18 F.3d at 909."
676,17," Additionally, Anazao cites Kaplan v. Rose, 49 F.3d 1363 (9th Cir. 1994) for the proposition that courts may ""deny a motion to 
amend on the basis of previous opportunities to amend when evidence related to a new claim was known to the plaintiff when an 
earlier version of the complaint was filed."" (Doc. 110, at 6). Nonetheless, the Kaplan court denied the motion because of 
prejudice, notably that trial was scheduled within two months and ""voluminous and protracted"" discovery had already concluded. 
Kaplan, 49 F.3d at 1370. This case similarly hinges upon whether undue prejudice would result were the court to grant the 
moving party's motion to amend. See also Mir v. Fosburg, 646 F.2d 342, 347 (9th Cir. 1980) (""The district court has discretion in 
deciding whether 'the late shift in the thrust of the case' will unfairly prejudice the defendants in their defense.""). "
677,18," The court's decision in Select Holding was guided by Rule 15(b) and therefore presents a slightly different scenario than the 
one currently before this Court. Nonetheless, the court's pronouncements are instructive."
677,19," Plaintiffs now specifically allege in their proposed amended complaint that they ""have suffered an antitrust injury which the 
antitrust laws were intended to prevent."" (Doc. 103-2, at 38). "
678,20," Additionally, Plaintiffs allege that ""[t]here was no other purpose, but an anticompetitive purpose for the dissemination of the 
Anazao Letter."" (Doc. 103-2, at 38). "
679,21," Plaintiffs concede that the District Court for the District of Columbia, in ASA Accugrade, Inc. v. Am. Numismatic Ass'n, 370 F. 
Supp. 2d 213, 217 (D.C. Dist. Ct. 2005), noted that defamation did not constitute a per se antitrust violation. (Doc. 103-2, at 39). "
688,1," Trinko, 540 U.S. at 409. "
719,1," Craftsmen also sues under Mo. Rev. Stat. § 416.031(1). HN1[
] Under Missouri law, Craftsmen's state antitrust claims must 
be construed in harmony with comparable federal claims. See Mo. Rev. Stat. § 416.141. Summary judgment on the federal 
claims mandates judgment on the state claims. See Alpha Shoe Serv. v. Fleming Cos., 849 F.2d 352, 353 (8th Cir.), cert. 
denied, 488 U.S. 942, 109 S. Ct. 367, 102 L. Ed. 2d 356 (1988)."
719,2," The factual background of this case is presented at length in Craftsmen Limousine, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 363 F.3d 761, 763-
71 (8th Cir. 2004), and is not repeated here. "
722,1," The affidavit states, in part:"
722,1," . At the request of plaintiffs, I identified the relevant market, analyzed the effects of Defendants' anticompetitive behavior 
on the relevant market, and analyzed the injury to the plaintiffs. This analysis was done in conjunction with factors identified 
by the court in [Craftsmen]. . . . ."
722,8," . The Defendants' actions in denying specialty limousine manufacturers access to advertising in trade magazines and 
trade shows resulted in an exclusion of specialty manufacturers from the limousine market with a corresponding decrease 
in sales."
722,9," . The usefulness and admissibility of econometric models in antitrust litigation is well-documented. The econometric model 
I used to analyze the effect of Defendants' anticompetitive behavior took into account other factors affecting the demand for 
specialty limousines, including changes in the aggregate market demand for limousines and changes in the number of 
competitors in the specialty limousine industry. I later added the number of traditional limousine manufacturers, which 
changed little from year to year, to the econometric model. The addition of this variable did not change the results of the 
regression analysis. . . . ."
722,12," . Based on interviews of individuals who work in the industry and an examination of the annual LCT fact books, we found 
no likely explanation for the drop in the demand of Craftsmen's limousines other than the anticompetitive behavior of 
Defendants. The conclusion applies to other specialty limousine manufacturers in the market during the applicable time 
period."
722,13," . Based on the evidence presented at the first trial of this matter, Defendant Ford possessed substantial power within the 
relevant market. "
724,2," The first paragraph of Scoggins's report states: You asked Research and Planning Consultants (""RPC"") to provide an analysis of the impact of the anticompetitive behavior 
by Ford Motor Company and American Coachworks (""the defendants"") on the net income of Craftsmen Limousine, Inc. 
(""Craftsmen""). This report includes (1) an analysis of the causes of the decline in Craftsmen's profits during the period of 
the anticompetitive behavior, and (2) our estimate of the economic damages Craftsmen sustained due to this behavior."
724,3," The Court notes the Eighth Circuit's opinion that ""the alleged restraints were arguably based, at least in part, on safety 
concerns."" Craftsmen, 363 F.3d at 776. "
725,4," Even with Scoggins's testimony as evidence, this Court questions whether Craftsmen can prove actual adverse effects on 
competition, or a relevant ""specialty limousine"" market and any defendant's power in any relevant market. "
731,1," Applera Corporation is the successor in whole or part to defendants PE Biosystems Group, PE Applied Biosystems, PE 
Corporation, and/or the Perkin-Elmer Corporation."
731,2," Roche holds other patents related to the PCR process, among them Patents Nos. 4,683,195 and 4,683,202. Compl. P18. "
732,3," MDL claims that defendants stifled competition by, among other things, enforcing the '818 patent though affirmative litigation. 
Specifically, MDL asserts that ""Roche, acting on behalf of itself and on behalf of Applera's predecessor PE, filed an action 
against Promega Corporation on October 27, 1992, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, 
alleging … infringement of the '818 Patent"" (""the Promega litigation"")."" Compl. P37."
732,4," Defendants are indeed correct that the vast majority of Walker Process claims are brought by parties against whom a patent is 
enforced. See Nobelpharma AB v. Implant Innovations, Inc., 141 F.3d 1059, 1067 (Fed. Cir 1998) (""An antitrust claim premised 
on stripping a patentee of its immunity from the antitrust laws is typically raised as a counterclaim by a defendant in a patent 
infringement suit."") (citing Argus Chem. Corp. v. Fibre Glass-Evercoat Co., 812 F.2d 1381, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 1987)). Indeed, with 
the exception of the two cases discussed infra, neither the parties nor the court have been able to identify an instance in which a 
customer litigated a Walker Process claim. "
733,5," HN3[
] Regardless of whether there is an antitrust violation, a party against whom a patent is being enforced is always free to 
raise, as a defense, that the patent was invalid as a result of ""inequitable conduct."" See Nobelpharma AB, 141 F.3d at 1070 
(""Inequitable conduct is thus an equitable defense in a patent infringement action and serves as a shield, while a more serious 
finding of fraud potentially exposes a patentee to antitrust liability and thus serves as a sword."")."
733,6," The In re Remeron court's confusion is further evidenced by its acknowledgment that ""plaintiffs … may bring antitrust claims on 
other grounds even though they are not direct competitors …."" 335 F. Supp. 2d at 529 (citing In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust 
Litig., 214 F.3d 395, 400 (3d Cir. 2000) (finding class plaintiffs pharmaceutical purchasers could sue for antitrust violations)). 
This statement evinces a belief that the Supreme Court created a new cause of action in Walker Process, which it did not. It 
merely clarified the means by which a plaintiff could gain access to the protection of federal antitrust laws. "
734,7," Because the Promega litigation plays a central role in the court's statute of limitations analysis, a brief history of the case is 
provided. Following Roche's purchase of the '818 patent, Roche came to believe that Promega was violating a license 
agreement negotiated with Cetus, and assigned to Roche following the purchase of the '818 patent. See Hoffmann-La Roche 
Inc. v. Promega Corp., 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10174, 33 U.S.P.Q. 2d 1641 (N.D. Cal. June 13, 1994). Roche initiated litigation 
against Promega in October of 1992. In response, in June 1994, Promega filed a counterclaim asserting that the '818 patent was "
735,," unenforceable due to inequitable conduct that occurred during the patent application process. In 1996, after Promega was 
granted partial summary judgment, a trial was ordered to determine whether there was clear and convincing evidence of intent to 
deceive the PTO. Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. v. Promega Corp., No. 93-1748 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 9, 1996) at 65. On December 7, 
1999, the court found that the '818 patent had been fraudulently obtained, and accordingly, determined that the '818 patent was 
unenforceable. The decision was appealed and on March 31, 2003, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit 
vacated the trial court's decision, affirmed in part, and remanded ""to determine, in the exercise of its judgment, whether under all 
the circumstances, the incidents of inequitable conduct that we have sustained are such as to justify the sanction of rendering 
the '818 Patent unenforceable."" Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. v. Promega Corp., 323 F.3d 1354, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2003). On remand, 
the district court once again found the '818 patent unenforceable. Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. v. Promega Corp., 319 F. Supp. 2d 
1011, 1014-16 (N.D. Cal. 2004)."
735,8," The court notes that MDL argues that, even if the court were to find that Applera's and Roche's alleged fraud was not self-
concealing, defendants have also engaged in affirmative acts of concealment, among them initiating ""sham litigation."" Such 
""sham litigation"" includes the patent enforcement action against Promega. Because the court finds that MDL was on notice of its 
claims prior to September 2000, it need not address this distinction. "
736,9," The 1999 Order in the Promega litigation made a number of specific factual findings in support of its holding that La Roche had 
engaged in inequitable conduct. Among the inequitable activities attributed to La Roche were: (1) ""making misleading statements 
regarding the relative fidelity of Taq as compared to the prior art enzymes""; (2) ""claiming that Taq purified by the method taught 
in Example VI had a specific activity of 250,000 units/mg""; (3) ""presenting Example VI as though it had been performed when, in 
fact, it had not been performed""; (4) ""making deceptive, scientifically unwarranted comparisons between the specific activity of 
the claimed enzyme and the specific activity reported by Chien et al. and Kalendin et al.""; (5) ""claiming that Taq purified 
according to the method taught in Example VI yielded a single 88 kd band on an SDS PAGE mini-gel""; and (6) ""claiming that the 
Taq produced was free from nuclease contamination.""  1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18986, 1999 WL 1797330, at *28. The court finds 
it significant that these exact findings appear verbatim in MDL's complaint. Compl. P42. Notwithstanding the fact that these 
findings were reaffirmed on remand in 2004, 319 F. Supp. 2d 1011, 1016 (N.D. Cal. 2004), there is no dispute that the findings 
were first published in 1999."
736,10," While MDL cites a number of cases in support of the proposition that whether a plaintiff was on notice should not be decided 
on a motion to dismiss, none of these cases involved the degree of notice present in the instant action. In Firestone v. Firestone, 
316 U.S. App. D.C. 152, 76 F.3d 1205, 1210 (D.C. Cir. 1996), for example, plaintiff did not receive notice that the defendant 
controlled the disputed trust fund until well within the limitations period. Similarly, the plaintiff in Riddell, 866 F.2d at 1494, 
received significantly less notice where defendant argued that, because ""plaintiff suspected that the price paid for his shares was 
too low,"" he should have been aware that an appraisal was not independently prepared. "
738,11," For this reason, much of Applera's cited authority is inapposite. Both Northlake Mktg. & Supply, Inc. v. Glaverbel S.A., 861 F. 
Supp. 653 (N.D. Ill. 1994), and Franzon v. Massena Mem'l Hosp., 89 F. Supp. 2d 270 (N.D.N.Y. 2000), are cases decided on 
motions for summary judgment."
738,12," In addition, the complaint alleges coordinated enforcement of the '818 patent. Id. P37 (""Roche, acting on behalf of itself and on 
behalf of Applera's predecessor PE, filed an action against Promega Corporation …""). The parties vigorously contest the 
significance of Applera's involvement in the Promega litigation. It would be imprudent to decide this question of fact at this 
juncture, and instead, the court will accept MDL's assertion as pleaded. In addition, because MDL has pleaded that Applera had 
at least some involvement in the attempt to enforce the '818 patent, the instant case is distinguishable from Mitsubishi Electric "
739,," Corp. v. IMS Tech., Inc., 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15350, 1997 WL 630187 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 30, 1997). In Mitsubishi, relied upon 
heavily by Applera, there were no allegations that the licensee defendants had assisted the patentee defendant's efforts to 
enforce the patent at issue, and more generally, ""no suggestion of any connection between the licensees and the conduct which 
violates [the antitrust laws]."" Id. 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15350 [WL] at *5. For the same reason Applera's citation to Yankees 
Entm't & Sports Network, LLC v. Cablevision Sys. Corp., 224 F. Supp. 2d 657, 678 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (finding a ""unilateral act by 
Cablevision"" and no allegation that codefendants had any involvement in alleged anticompetitive behavior), is also unavailing."
739,13, There is no dispute that MDL has pled the alleged fraud before the PTO with sufficient particularity.
739,14," The court observes that HN19[
] Rule 9(b) does not place a heavy burden on plaintiffs, given that Rule 9 must be read in conjunction with the relatively liberal pleading requirements of Rule 8. See Shahmirzadi v. Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., 
636 F. Supp. 49, 53 (D.D.C. 1985)."
739,15," Allegations regarding Applera's knowledge of the alleged fraud involved in the procurement of the '818 patent appear 
throughout the complaint, for example: Applera and/or its predecessors have maintained agreements with Roche, and entered into new agreements with Roche, to 
preserve, extend, and exercise power over the Taq market, despite Applera's knowledge that the '818 patent was procured 
by fraudulent representations and omissions to the PTO. Compl. P34. (emphasis added);"" Defendants have threatened and filed legal actions asserting infringement of the '818 patent, despite being aware of the 
fraudulent conduct before the PTO that led to the procurement of the patent and, hence, the fact that the patent was invalid.

753,5, The Court has described these wholesale and retail markets in both the First Dismissal Order and the Second Dismissal Order. 
754,6," Plaintiffs' allegation of a ""de facto consolidation"" appears to be inconsistent with a claim under section 2 of the Sherman Act,

755,7," Defendants also move to dismiss any claim by the NCRA brought in an individual capacity under the UCL. The Court does not

769,7," While the focus of the argument concern Connecticut contacts,HN5[
]  ""where[, as here,] Congress has spoken by authorizing 
nationwide service of process, . . . the jurisdiction of a federal court need not be confined by the defendant's contacts with the 
state in which the federal court sits. Pinker v. Roche Holdings Ltd., 292 F.3d 361, 369 (3d cir. 2002). Accordingly, ""a federal 
court's personal jurisdiction may be assessed on the basis of the defendant's national contacts, [not just those contacts found in 
the particular state where the federal court sits""). Id. "

781,1," CIGNA Insurance Company (Australia) Ltd. has been known as named Defendant ACE Insurance Ltd. since July 1999. 
(Second Am. Compl. P15.) For simplicity, the Court will refer to the entire group of Defendants once known as or affiliated with 
INA or CIGNA as ""INA"" or ""CIGNA"" unless specifically referring to a specific subentity or affiliate. In any event, the various INA 
and CIGNA entities have jointly filed Defendants' various motions for partial summary judgment with the other Defendants in this 
matter and have joined in all briefs relevant to these motions. "
784,2," Plaintiffs also make this inference, commenting that Defendants filed this motion under Rule 56 because they ""perhaps [did] not 
want[] to strike out three times under Rule 12(b)."" (Pls.' Br. 3.)"
784,3," While Defendants argue for the application of generic summary judgment standards (e.g., Defs.' Reply Br. 2-4), their specific 
contentions regarding the burden of proof and the authority of this Court to consider the entire record make clear that 
Defendants understood that Rule 12(b)(1) standards should apply. Defendants cite to and quote the Third Circuit's discussions 
of ""in fact"" challenges to subject matter jurisdiction in arguing that the Court may weigh jurisdictional evidence and that disputed 
material facts should not preclude consideration of jurisdictional claims. (Defs.' Br. 12 n.17 (quoting Carpet Group Int'l v. Oriental 
Rug Importers Ass'n, Inc., 227 F.3d 62, 69 (3d Cir. 2000) and citing Turicentro, 303 F.3d at 300 n.4.) Both of these cases clearly 
apply Rule 12(b)(1) standards to FTAIA challenges. Defendants even cite approvingly to United Phosphorus, which expressly 
rejected the notion that FTAIA challenges should be assessed under summary judgment rules. (Defs.' Br. 12 n.17.) As 
Defendants' own argument and citations illustrate, Defendants simply did not need to file their motion under Rule 56 in order for 
the Court to consider the entire record relevant to jurisdictional facts."
784,4," Treating Defendants' motion as a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) also requires this Court to consider the status of 
Plaintiffs' cross-motion for summary judgment. Of course, CSR's motion cannot be viewed as a ""cross-motion to dismiss"" its own 
claims. Rather, it perhaps may best be analogized to a motion for a declaratory judgment. Plaintiffs contend that it filed its cross-
motion ""to avoid further redundant motions on defendants' part,"" and that its cross-motion asks that the Court ""further 
affirmatively hold that the Court does have subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs' antitrust claims."" (Pls.' Br. 6.) However, as 
discussed later in this opinion, the Court rejects the notion that Defendants' instant motion is somehow redundant or moot. 
Furthermore, a motion asking the court to declare that it ""does have subject matter jurisdiction"" makes little logical sense, and 
seems to this Court to be a rather transparent attempt by Plaintiffs to enjoy additional opportunities to present its argument to 
this Court by way of a lengthier response brief and a reply brief. Defendants might have opened the door to this questionable 
tactic by improperly identifying its motion as one for summary judgment rather than as a motion to dismiss. Yet Plaintiffs 
themselves called Defendants' motion a ""hybrid Rule 56/Rule 12(b)(1) challenge"" (Pls.' Reply Br. 1) and argued for application of 
Rule 12(b)(1) facial challenge standards to Defendants' motion. Plaintiffs certainly understood that Defendants' motion was not 
one for summary judgment, yet they proceeded to file a ""cross-motion"" for summary judgment in any event. The instant motions have been pending for over a year, and it would therefore be inequitable at this late date to reject Plaintiffs' 
reply brief due to the suspect nature of its ""cross-motion."" However, the Court will focus its analysis on Defendants' motion, and 
reiterates that Plaintiffs' cross-motion for summary judgment is procedurally dubious at best. "
785,5," In arguing for application of these ""in fact"" standards, Defendants necessarily inform this Court that ""the existence of disputed 
material facts will not preclude the trial court from evaluating for itself the merits of jurisdictional claims."" (Defs.' Br. 12 n.17 
(quoting Carpet Group, 227 F.3d at 69 (internal quotation omitted)).) This argument only fortifies the Court's conclusion that Rule 
56 summary judgment standards, which indeed preclude the Court from granting summary judgment in the face of disputed 
material facts, do not apply here and that Defendants' motion must be construed as one arising under Rule 12(b)(1). "
786,6," Unless otherwise noted, reference in this Court's FTAIA analysis to Plaintiffs' ""antitrust claims"" concerns Plaintiffs' federal 
antitrust claims under the Sherman Act. The Court will address Plaintiffs' state-law antitrust claims in Section VII, infra. "
788,7," The United States Supreme Court in Empagran usefully translated the ""technical language"" of the FTAIA into an 
understandable form: HN16[
] [The FTAIA] initially lays down a general rule placing all (non-import) activity involving foreign commerce outside 
the Sherman Act's reach. It then brings such conduct back within the Sherman Act's reach provided that the conduct both 
(1) sufficiently affects American commerce, i.e., it has a ""direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect"" on 
American domestic, import, or (certain) export commerce, and (2) has an effect of a kind that antitrust law considers 
harmful, i.e., the ""effect"" must ""give rise to a [Sherman Act] claim."" Id. at 162 (quoting 15 U.S.C. §§ 6a(1), (2)) (emphasis in original)."
788,8," Turicentro also identified conduct ""directed at the competitiveness of a foreign market"" as conduct involving foreign trade or 
commerce under the FTAIA. Turicentro, 303 F.3d at 302 (citing Kruman v. Christie's Int'l PLC, 284 F.3d 384, 395 (2d Cir. 2002)). 
However, the Supreme Court in Empagran reversed the essential holding of Kruman and held that under the FTAIA, jurisdiction 
may not be exercised over claims arising from wholly foreign anticompetitive effect, even if the challenged conduct also had an 
independent, adverse domestic anticompetitive effect. Empagran, 542 U.S. at 159. For present purposes, it is only necessary to 
observe that wholly foreign transactions qualify as ""conduct involving trade or commerce … with foreign nations"" under the 
FTAIA. Id. at 163."
788,9," HN19[
] Section One of the Sherman Act prohibits restraints of trade ""among the several States, or with foreign nations."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. In Turicentro, plaintiffs based their antitrust claims on Section One of the Sherman Act and did not and could not 
argue that their complaint alleged trade or commerce ""among the Several States."" Therefore, the Third Circuit observed that 
Plaintiffs could not argue that ""their allegations do not encompass 'trade or commerce … with foreign nations' for Foreign Trade "
789,," Antitrust Improvements Act purposes without sacrificing their ultimate statutory claim under the Sherman Act."" Turicentro, 303 
F.3d at 302 n.9. The same logic applies here and supports the Court's conclusion that Plaintiffs' allegations involve foreign trade 
or foreign commerce under the FTAIA. "
791,10," The Lloyd's Defendants, consisting of certain underwriters at Lloyd's, London, Excess Insurance Company Limited and 
Stronghold Insurance Company, have reached a settlement with CSR and have been dismissed from this case. However, the 
conduct of the Lloyd's Defendants, documents and other evidence created by them, and deposition testimony from officials of 
the Lloyd's Defendants, remain relevant to this matter and will be discussed where appropriate. "
793,11," The Court will further consider the issues regarding CSR America with regard to assessment of anticompetitive effect under 
the FTAIA later in this Opinion. "
796,12," 0f course, the extent to which the policies covered Plaintiffs' American asbestos-related risks forms the central issue in this 
case, and the Court expresses no opinion on the merits of the parties' arguments in this regard at this time."
796,13," Although this Court's prior Rule 12(b)(6) opinion is not determinative, even in that opinion the Court only recognized that 
Defendants' conduct, on its face, harmed competition ""within the market for general and products liability insurance with respect 
to plaintiffs."" CSR, 40 F. Supp. 2d at 565. The market at issue here is the one for insurance policies, not for coverage for risks. "
797,14," Plaintiffs cite several other examples of alleged misrepresentations (Pls.' Br. 19 n.6), but two of these appear to involve 
communications between CIGNA and Richard Oliver, CSR's broker (Cosenza Certif., Exs. 33, 34), not with other insurers. The 
Court is unable to determine whether an additional cited document, a memorandum from Michael Payne to Steve Nicholson of 
P.W.S. advising of CSR's withdrawal of its claims (Cosenza Certif., Ex. 29), represents communication to a non-participating 
insurance company."
797,15," CSR additionally points to HN36[
] subsection (1)(B) of the FTAIA, which allows for jurisdiction where Defendants' conduct 
had a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect on ""export trade or export commerce with foreign nations, of a 
person engaged in such trade or commerce in the United States."" 15 U.S.C. § 6a(1)(B). CSR argues that because the alleged 
boycott ""had a substantial effect on the ability of U.S. insurance companies to insure CSR's 'worldwide' risks, i.e., the exportation 
of insurance services, the FTAIA cannot bar CSR's United States antitrust claims."" (Pls.' Reply Br. 13.) However, CSR has 
provided no evidence to support its assertions. Furthermore, CSR's argument in this regard undercuts and contradicts its 
argument that Defendants' conduct here involved import commerce. "
798,16," In another pending summary judgment motion, Defendants argue that CSR America was not an ""additional insured"" under 
some of the policies at issue. Nothing in this Opinion should be interpreted as deciding this issue. For present purposes, 
Plaintiffs allege involvement of CSR America in the purported boycott, supported by some disputed record evidence. These 
allegations are sufficient to demonstrate, for jurisdictional purposes only, a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect 
on domestic commerce with regard to CSR America."
798,17," The Supreme Court in Empagran only held that the FTAIA denies jurisdiction where the defendant's alleged anticompetitive 
conduct causes an adverse foreign effect independent of the domestic effects of the conduct. Empagran, 542 U.S. at 164. The 
Court declined to address the situation in which the foreign injury was not independent of but rather ""linked to"" the domestic 
effects of defendant's alleged anticompetitive conduct. Id. at 175 (explicitly refusing to resolve issue because Court of Appeals 
did not address this argument). Plaintiffs in Empagran argued that without an adverse domestic effect, defendants could not 
have maintained the alleged international price-fixing conspiracy that inflicted foreign injury on the foreign plaintiffs. 542 U.S. at 
175. Here, however, the domestic and foreign effects of Defendants' alleged conduct are independent and easily separable."
798,18," In a footnote, Defendants suggested to the Court that if it ""were to determine, incorrectly, that CSR America had demonstrated 
the U.S. domestic antitrust injury necessary to survive summary judgment, under Empagran, that would only permit retention of 
the Sherman Act claims of CSR America and still require dismissal of the claims of CSR Australia."" (Defs.' Reply Br. 12 n.7.) 
Although the Court rejects Defendants' argument that CSR America has not shown the requisite domestic anticompetitive effect 
under the FTAIA, it agrees with Defendants that under these circumstances, the Court must dismiss CSR Limited's (or, in 
Defendants' terminology, CSR Australia's) antitrust claims but retain jurisdiction over those of CSR America. "
799,19," This Opinion only addresses whether the Court may exercise subject matter jurisdiction over CSR America's New Jersey state 
antitrust claims. The Court expresses no opinion on the merit of these claims. "
804,1," The trustees memorialized their actions and sent them to the Ethics Counsel for confirmation. The counsel's response differed 
slightly from what was indicated by the minutes, stating that he could not define ""quorum"" without looking at their bylaws, but 
acknowledging that he suggested the procedure of having the least-conflicted trustee vote. J.A. 1438. "
805,2," Defendants argue that The Imaging Center's claims are barred by the Sherman Act's four-year statute of limitations. Because 
we find that summary judgment was appropriate on the merits of The Imaging Center's claims, we will assume, arguendo, as the 
district court did, that The Imaging Center's claims are not time-barred, given the alleged recent accrual of damages and the 
allegations of a continuing violation. "
806,3," Citing In re Flat Glass Antitrust Litg., 385 F.3d 350, 360 (3d Cir. 2004), The Imaging Center also argues that in absence of 
evidence of collusion, it may prove concerted action and negate inferences of independent conduct through certain ""plus 
factors."" However, the Flat Glass plus factors apply where ""conscious parallelism"" is alleged. Conscious parallelism refers to the 
situation of an oligopoly or concentrated market where firms maintain supracompetitive price levels while aware of and because 
of the similar action of the few other firms in their sector. Id. at 359. Such is not the situation here. We also decline to attach the significance The Imaging Center does to Key Enters. of Delaware, Inc. v. Venice Hosp., 919 F.2d 
1550 (11th Cir. 1990), vacated for reh'g en banc, 979 F.2d 806 (11th Cir. 1992), dismissed as moot, 9 F.3d 893 (11th Cir. 1993), 
where the Eleventh Circuit upheld a jury finding of group boycott. That case is of no precedential authority even in its own circuit."
806,4," The Imaging Center points to a 1999 WMHS reference to ""pent up demand[]"" for radiology services. J.A. 1347. Notwithstanding 
the fact that this statement was merely an assumption of a WMHS consultant evaluating the feasibility of a new imaging center, 
the statement does not speak to a decline in the available quantity of radiology services. "
807,5," Indeed, for years before Memorial and Sacred Heart affiliated into WMHS, both hospitals employed exclusive contracts for the 
supply of radiology services, including the one under which Dr. Jackson had practiced at Memorial. "
808,6," HN8[
] Courts generally consider conduct not deemed anticompetitive under § 1 similarly unactionable under § 2. See R.J. Reynolds Tobacco v. Philip Morris, Inc., 199 F. Supp. 2d 362, 395 n.24, aff'd without published op., 67 Fed. Appx. 810 (4th Cir. 
2003); Retina Assocs., P.A. v. S. Baptist Hosp., 105 F.3d 1376, 1384 (11th Cir. 1997) (per curiam) (""While participating in an 
unlawful horizontal group boycott may be sufficient to establish a Section 2 claim, here such a finding is precluded by the Court's 
grant of summary judgment against Plaintiff on Count I. As such, there is no genuine issue of material fact as to the existence of 
predatory conduct.""); Williams v. I.B. Fischer Nevada, 999 F.2d 445, 448 (9th Cir. 1993) (""[A] § 1 claim insufficient to withstand 
summary judgment cannot be used as the sole basis for a § 2 claim."") (internal quotation omitted). The Imaging Center argues that a recent D.C. Circuit decision supports its claim that conduct deemed legitimate under § 1 can 
still support liability under § 2. See United States v. Microsoft Corp., 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330, 253 F.3d 34, 70 (D.C. Cir. 2001)). 
The Microsoft court, however, dealt with a scenario where the exclusive contracts did not foreclose a sufficient portion of the 
market to violate § 1, but had no procompetitive justification, making them actionable under § 2. Id. at 71. Although exclusive 
dealing is alleged here, a procompetitive justification has also been shown, as discussed above. The conduct alleged for the § 1 
claims, therefore, is of no avail to The Imaging Center's monopolization and attempted monopolization claims. "
818,1, West Coast was apparently only permitted to sell or distribute the beauty products to salons or similar entities. 
821,2," Arguably Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21 is also implicated by West Coast's motion to substitute and add parties. That rule, 
inter alia, provides: ""Parties may be dropped or added by order of the court on motion of any party or of its own initiative at any 
stage of the action and on such terms as are just."" After review, the Court determines that it can address West Coast's proposed 
substitution and addition of parties pursuant to Rule 15(a) without reference to Rule 21. "
822,3," The Court's consideration of the timing of the motion is mandated by District of Minnesota Local Rule 72.1(b)(1) which requires 
magistrate judges to review the case's scheduling order (Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)) before ruling on pre-trial motions."
822,4," Rusk was responding to West Coast's previous motion to amend (Doc. No. 53) which West Coast withdrew and refiled (Doc. 
No. 142) at the request of the Court. Rusk incorporates by reference its arguments to West Coast's previous motion to amend in 
responding to the present motion to amend. (See Doc. No. 148 at 35 n. 11.) Under the unique circumstances presented here, 
the Court will allow the incorporation. "
828,5," Punitive damages claims cannot be included as of right in an original complaint in certain actions such as those against health 
care providers and religious corporations. See Cal. Civ. Code §§ 425.13,14. Rusk does not claim to fit into one of these special 
categories of litigants. "
844,1," In this proceeding, the Justice Department and various state attorneys general alleged that Microsoft had violated provisions of 
the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., and section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15. See United States v. Microsoft Corp., 
84 F. Supp. 2d 9, 12 (D.D.C. 1999). Hereinafter, we will refer to this proceeding as ""the federal antitrust action."" "
845,2," As indirect purchasers, the plaintiffs did not buy their operating system software directly from Microsoft but, instead, purchased 
the software from intermediaries such as retailers and wholesalers. "
847,3," Moreover, it is questionable whether Count 47 would have been sufficient even if it had disclaimed any ability to accept more 
than $ 75,000. There would remain a conflict between article 862, which grants the plaintiff the relief to which he is entitled, even 
if it was not demanded in the complaint, and De Aguilar's holding that a binding stipulation suffices to prevent federal jurisdiction. 
We believe the best way to resolve this conflict may be to require that the stipulation be made outside of the text of the complaint 
(but of course still within the pending proceedings), so that any state laws concerning the ad damnum clause are not implicated. 
This position is supported by language in De Aguilar. See 47 F.3d at 1412 (stating that plaintiffs ""must file a binding stipulation or 
affidavit with their complaints"" (emphasis added)). "

862,4," Spirit's experts, Professors Kenneth Elzinga and David Mills have authored economic studies on predation that have been cited 
by the United States Supreme Court in its antitrust decisions on predatory pricing. Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson

(1989). Spirit's other experts and Northwest's experts are also eminently qualified. "
863,5," Professor Dempsey's research touched on the issues in this action, quoting Northwest's Michael Levine that ""I believe 
predation is possible and that it occurs. . . . It is possible for an incumbent to impose on prospective entrants nonrecoverable 
costs by pricing in a way that seeks to ensure that they do not attract a significant share of passengers regardless of the 
incumbent's own cost."" Id. at 708. Professor Dempsey cites Dr. Alfred Kahn who described Northwest as having a 'scorched-
earth' policy in which Northwest drove another low fare carrier, People Express, out of the market by substantially undercutting 
People Express's price while simultaneously increasing the number of flights in the market: ""If predation means anything, it 
means deep, pinpointed, discriminatory price cut by big companies aimed at driving price cutters out of the market, in order then 
to be able to raise price back to their previous levels. I have little doubt that is what Northwest was and is trying to do."" Id. See 
also Russell A. Klingaman, ""Predatory Pricing and Other Exclusionary Conduct in the Airline Industry: Is Antitrust Law the 
Solution?"" 4 DePaul Bus. L. J. 281, 306 (1992) (quoting Michael Levine: ""an incumbent who used such tactics [below-cost 
pricing and yield management] a few times quickly develops a reputation for fierce response to entry. [Levine] calls this 
reputational information 'the predatory investment in deterrence.'"" (footnotes omitted). "

866,7," In his report on variable costs, Professor Elzinga also found that ""In the airline industry, there are several layers of marginal (i.e. 
variable) costs. . . . Think of these as passenger variable costs. . . and include . . . the cost of processing the ticket, the cost of 
processing the passenger through the gate, the cost of in-flight food and beverages, insurance and other liability related 
expenses, and the cost of the extra fuel burned because of the passenger's additional weight. . . Flight variable costs … include 
the single-passenger variable costs described above, plus takeoff or landing fees, the fuel costs of flying the empty aircraft, and 
some additional maintenance and crew costs incurred from the operation of the aircraft. The third are the costs . . . [that] include the opportunity cost associated with the use of that aircraft. . . . Finally. . . route variable 
costs. . . include all of the costs listed above plus costs incurred in setting the new 'station' with ticket counters, maintenance 
facilities, and other service expenses."" (J.A. 789-90). "
868,8," Professor Ordover explained that ""VABS is equal to total onboard revenue (for the route segment) plus net beyond revenue 
contributions, minus variable expenses. VABSO is equal to VABS minus the cost of aircraft ownership. These measures which 
include the beyond contribution are used by Northwest in order to assess the profitability of individual routes as part of the 
overall network. VABS is often used for relatively short-term tactical marketing decisions and VABSO is frequently used to 
determine whether a route is successful over time."" (J.A. 401, n. 44). "
872,9," Economists note that to avoid costly litigation, proof of recoupment alone can serve as an independent screening mechanism 
for predatory pricing claims. See Donald J. Boudreaux, Kenneth G. Elzinga and David Mills, ""The Supreme Court's Predation 
Odyssey: From Fruit Pies to Cigarettes,"" 4 Sup. Ct. Econ. Rev. 57, 72 (1995). "
878,1," As I discuss infra, despite Northwest's argument to the contrary, our opinion in Directory Sales Management Corp. v. Ohio Bell 
Telephone Co., 833 F.2d 606 (6th Cir. 1987), does not stand for the proposition that we must evaluate Northwest's practices on 
a route-wide basis rather than a more segmented fare-specific analysis. "
879,2," Northwest argues in its brief that this issue has already been decided by Sixth Circuit precedent. Specifically, Northwest claims 
that our holding in Directory Sales Management, requires a court to look at an alleged predator's ""operations taken as a whole."" 
833 F.2d at 614. I do not find this case to be on point. In Directory Sales, the two companies competed in the exact same market 
but the plaintiff attempted to isolate one portion within that market to demonstrate that the incumbent was predatorily pricing. Id. 
at 613. We held that the portion which the plaintiff identified was neither a separate product nor a separate market and that the 
plaintiff would need to show predatory pricing in the market as a whole. Id. at 614. Critical to our holding in that case was that the 
two companies' businesses were coextensive. By contrast, in this case, Spirit's service is not coextensive with Northwest's 
service. Spirit alleges that Northwest engaged in predatory pricing in the only market in which Spirit serves, i.e., local, price-
sensitive passengers. If a reasonable trier of fact finds that such a distinct market exists, then Spirit has alleged a cognizable § 2 
claim. Therefore, I conclude that our holding in Directory Sales does not apply. "

893,5," Defendants also argue that antitrust immunity applies because the challenged restraints are the acts of the ""sovereign itself"" 
and that the State is ""ipso factor"" immune under Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315 (1943). However, 
the challenged restraints reduce price competition while leaving pricing determinations to private actors, which the state enforces 
without reviewing the prices for reasonableness. See, e.g.,  324 Liquor Corp. v. Duffy, 479 U.S. 335, 345, 107 S. Ct. 720, 93 L. 
Ed. 2d 667 (1987) HN10[

909,3," In its complaint, plaintiff incorrectly stated an alleged violation of § 43(a)(1)(A). Defendant recognized the mistake and

43(a)(1)(B). "
911,4," We also note that, with certain exceptions, HN21[
] Illinois courts have held that Rule 9(b) , requiring a claimant to plead the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake with particularity, applies to claims under ICFA. See Jacobson v. Ford Motor Co., 
1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16213, 1999 WL 966432, *4 (N.D.Ill.1999) (citing Gallagher Corp. v. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., 
940 F.Supp.176, 180 (N.D.Ill.1996)); Swift v. First USA Bank, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8208, 1999 WL 350847, *5 (N.D.Ill.1999). In 
Eromon v. Grand Auto Sales, Inc., 351 F.Supp.2d 825, 827 (N.D.Ill.2004). we also required a claimant to plead claims under the 
ICFA with particularity. In this case plaintiff has not pled its fraud claims with particularity; it has not pled the circumstances, ""the 
who, what, when, where, and how,"" in detail, as required under the Seventh Circuit's interpretation of Rule 9(b). See DiLeo v. 
Ernst & Young, 901 F.2d 624, 627 (7th Cir.1990). "
924,1," Also before the Court is Defendants' Motion to Strike Plaintiffs' Affidavits Containing Legal Conclusions (Docket No. 34), in 
which Defendants ask the Court to strike the Declarations of J. Owen Todd (Pls.' Br. Ex. 1) and Howard J. Sedran (Pls.' Br. Ex. 
2) from the record. The Court has not relied upon those Declarations. Defendants' Motion is, therefore, dismissed as moot. "

Ltd. P'ship v. Flynn, 710 F. Supp. 23, 28 (D. Mass 1989). "
928,3," Comcast essentially admitted as much during the September 7, 2004 Argument. Comcast's counsel, in urging the Court to rely 
on the language of the Cable Act and not state law contract formation principles in determining the enforceability of the 
Arbitration Agreements, explicitly stated that if state law principles were used, there could be a genuine issue of material fact as 
to whether valid Agreements were formed. (09/07/04 Tr. at 39). "
930,4," Plaintiff Kellman disconnected his cable service in December 2003, but his use of cable services in the twelve preceding 
months binds him under the 2002 Policies & Practices Arbitration Agreement."
930,5," The Court notes that these arguments apply to those Plaintiffs who initially subscribed to Comcast service in Philadelphia prior 
to December 2001, when Comcast began to include arbitration clauses in the Work Orders, and in Chicago prior to November 
2002, when the Policies & Practices were amended to include the arbitration clause Comcast seeks to enforce. These 
arguments thus apply to all Plaintiffs except Caroline Cutler, who initially subscribed to Comcast service in the Philadelphia 
region in April 2003. "
933,6," Comcast contends that the Philadelphia Plaintiffs' argument with respect to arbitration costs is rendered moot by Comcast's 
current offer to pay for all reasonable arbitration filing fees and arbitrators' costs and expenses.HN30[
]  The Third Circuit has 
rejected such ""after-the-fact offers"" as irrelevant to the cost inquiry where the arbitration agreement itself provides that the "
934,," plaintiff is liable for arbitration fees and costs. Spinetti, 324 F.3d at 217 n.2 (refusing to consider defendant's offer to pay the 
costs of arbitration). ""'If the provision, as drafted, would deter potential litigants, then it is unenforceable, regardless of whether, 
in a particular case,[the defendant] agrees to pay a particular litigant's share of the fees and costs to avoid such a holding.'"" Id.

] As applied in antitrust law, the continuing violations doctrine allows a plaintiff to recover for anti-competitive conduct that would ordinarily be time-barred as long as the conduct represents an ongoing unlawful practice that includes violations 
within the limitations period. See 2 Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P320c (2d ed. 2002). "
937,8," Plaintiffs argue that the unenforceable provisions of the Arbitration Agreements so permeate the Agreements with illegality that 
they preclude severance. The Court has found that there are but two provisions in each of the Philadelphia and Chicago 
Arbitration Agreements that are unenforceable. See Spinetti, 324 F.3d at 214 (holding that two unenforceable provisions could 
be severed from an arbitration agreement). Accordingly, the Arbitration Agreements do not represent an ""'integrated scheme to 
contravene public policy'"" and severance is appropriate. Parilla, 368 F.3d at 288 (quoting Graham Oil Co. v. ARCO Prods. Co., a 
Div. of Atlantic Richfield Co., 43 F.3d 1244, 1249 (9th Cir. 1994)). "
942,1," There is one similarity between Aikens and this case. In Aikens I noted that in the absence of the pleading of specific causes of 
action, the fact that Louisiana's antitrust statute was limited to intrastate conduct implied that plaintiffs were relying upon federal 
law because Microsoft's alleged ""anti-competitive practices"" and ""monopolistic behaviors"" were interstate in nature. Here, 
Microsoft likewise contends that South Carolina's antitrust statute is limited to intrastate conduct. However, because Walsh has 
expressly asserted her claim under the South Carolina antitrust statute, if Microsoft's contention is correct, that would be a 
ground to dismiss the state law claim, not to remove it. As stated in note 2, infra, because I am dismissing Walsh's claim on 
Illinois Brick grounds, I am not reaching that question. "
944,2," Microsoft contends Walsh's claim under South Carolina's antitrust statute also fails as a matter of law because the statute only 
regulates intrastate commerce. I need not reach this issue because Walsh's claim is barred by Illinois Brick."
944,3," I assume that Walsh does not want to pursue her own individual claim which, according to her allegations, is quite modest in 
value. If my assumption is incorrect, Walsh may file a motion for reconsideration, and I will then decide how to proceed. "
1002,1," The court also finds that the first and second counterclaims fail to state a claim against Russo, as Russo is not the patent 
owner. "
1006,2," As noted above, Sherwin Williams alleges that Chip-Mender and Russo disclosed the Pentel design patent-a patent for the 
outer case or shape of the product-but failed to disclose ""highly material information"" regarding the inner ""construction"" of the 
Pentel pen. Sherwin Williams does not, however, plead with specificity the particular prior art that was allegedly not disclosed."
1006,3," Chip-Mender and Russo also contend that sham litigation claims implicate the right to petition governmental bodies under 
Noerr-Pennington. See Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. 
Ed. 2d 464 (1961); United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965). They assert that 
sham litigation claims are subject to a heightened pleading standard, although they do not seek dismissal of the fourth 
counterclaim on the basis that the facts were not pled with sufficient specificity. The court notes that the Ninth Circuit recently 
clarified this issue, ruling in Empress LLC v. City and County of San Francisco, 419 F.3d 1052 (9th Cir. 2005), a case involving 
the application of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, that the notice pleading standard applies unless the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure require otherwise. Id. at 1055-56. "
1016,1," The facts are derived from the ""Defendant's Local Rule 56.1 Statement of Material Facts as to Which No Genuine Dispute 
Exists"" (""DF P    "") (Docket No. 34); the exhibits contained in the ""Defendant's Appendix of Summary Judgment Materials"" (""Def. 
Ex.    "") (Docket No. 35); the ""Plaintiff/Respondent's Statement of Material Facts as to Which He Contends There Exists a 
Genuine Issue to be Tried"" (""PF""); facts contained in the ""Plaintiff's Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment""

1021,5," Pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151A, § 25(e)(2), no benefits shall be paid to an individual ""for the period of unemployment 
next ensuing and until the individual has had at least eight weeks of work and in each of said weeks has earned an amount 
equivalent to or in excess of the individual's weekly benefit amount after the individual has left work . . . by discharge shown to 
the satisfaction of the [DET] commissioner by substantial and credible evidence to be attributable to deliberate misconduct in 
wilful disregard of the employing unit's interest. . . ."" "
1022,6," The only other evidence of ""bad faith"" referred to by the plaintiff is the fact that his termination was allegedly in violation of 
public policy. These arguments will be addressed in connection with Count III of the Complaint, infra. After a thorough review of 
the record, this court has not identified any other evidence to support a claim that Reynolds acted in bad faith when it terminated 
Rodio's employment after numerous warnings. "
1025,7," In light of the Supreme Court's ruling, this court will not address whether an individual salesman's personal assessment 
concerning the effect of advertising (an amorphous subject at best) can ever be deemed to be violative of a clearly defined 
public policy. "
1030,1," Although Plaintiffs use various terms to describe the anticompetitive relationship between the patents in the pool, e.g., ""blocking 
patents,"" ""complementary patents, ""competing patents"" and ""substitute patents,"" their claim appears to be based on the inclusion 
of patents that are not essential, as that term is defined in the DOJ's business review letter. Therefore, the Court will discuss this 
claim in terms of essential and nonessential patents."
1030,2," In the Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs briefly reference price stabilization in the context of their price fixing claim, but 
they do not flesh out the facts or the law supporting that theory. Nevertheless, Plaintiffs devoted a considerable amount of their 
oral argument to the theory of price stabilization. Price stabilization typically occurs when ""firms exchange price information in 
order to stabilize the price, thereby interfering with price setting by market forces.""  Stratmore v. Goodbody, 866 F.2d 189, 192 
(6th Cir. 1989). Here, Plaintiffs' argue Defendants' patent pool has allowed them to stabilize the price of DVD players. Despite 
this argument, however, Plaintiffs have failed to plead any facts to support this theory. "
1031,3," Plaintiffs' explanation of the ""illusory"" nature of these individual licenses also contradicts their assertion that the patent pool 
includes nonessential patents. (See Second Am. Compl. at P44(d)) (stating licenses to individual patents ""would be ineffective 
unless the whole pool was licensed."") "
1032,4," Defendants presented this document to the Court in responding to Plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order. (See 
Docket No. 71, Declaration of Jason Chin Hung Kwan in opposition to Plaintiffs' application for a temporary restraining order 
(""Kwan Decl.""), Ex. J.)"
1032,5," This provision of the License Agreement also diminishes Plaintiffs' allegation that the patent pool causes injury to competition 
by thwarting invention. Contrary to Plaintiffs' allegation, this provision of the License Agreement contemplates that, licensees 
may innovate or improve upon Defendants' inventions, and it sets forth terms for licensing those innovations back to Defendants. "
1033,6," To the extent Plaintiffs are alleging their group boycott claim is subject to the per se rule of illegality, they have failed to allege 
any facts to support their allegation that Defendants ""entered into an agreement or conspiracy to selectively limit the number of 
licensees that manufacture DVD players for sale or resale in the United States."" (Second Am. Compl. at P195.) The facts set out 
in the Second Amended Complaint support Plaintiffs' allegation that Defendants have entered into a contract to pool and license 
their respective DVD-related patents, but there are no facts to support a claim that Defendants entered into an agreement to limit 
the number of licensees under that contract. "
1060,1," To shield its ability to compete with other manufacturers, Volvo keeps confidential its precise method for calculating 
concessions offered to dealers.  374 F.3d 701, 704-705 (CA8 2004); App. 337-338. "
1061,2," The jury also awarded Reeder damages of $513,750 on Reeder's state-law claim under the Arkansas Franchise Practices Act.  
No question is before us respecting that claim, which trained on Volvo's alleged design to eliminate Reeder as a Volvo dealer. 
See  supra, at 171, 163 L. Ed. 2d, at 672-673, 126 S. Ct. 860. "
1063,3," A dealer's reputation for securing favorable concessions, we recognize, may influence the customer's bidding invitations.  Cf.  
post, at 183, n 2, 163 L. Ed. 2d, at 680, 126 S. Ct. 860.  We do not pursue that point here, however, because Reeder did not 
present--or even look for--evidence that Volvo consistently disfavored Reeder while it consistently favored certain other dealers. 
See  supra, at 172-173, 163 L. Ed. 2d, at 673, 126 S. Ct. 860. "
1064,4," LEdHN[5B][

1064,680," , 681, 126 S. Ct 860.  But Robinson-Patman does not bar a manufacturer from restructuring its distribution networks to 
improve the efficiency of its operations.  If Volvo did not honor its obligations to Reeder as its franchisee, ""[a]ny remedy . . . lies 
in state laws addressing unfair competition and the rights of franchisees, not in the Robinson-Patman Act."" Brief for United 
States as Amicus Curiae 28."
1064,5," See also Hovenkamp P 2333c, p 109 (commenting that the Eighth Circuit's expansive interpretation ""views the [Robinson-
Patman Act] as a guarantee of equal profit margins on sales actually made,"" and thereby exposes manufacturers to treble 
damages unless they ""charge uniform prices to their dealers""). "
1065,1," Section 2 of the Clayton Act, as amended by § 1 of the Robinson-Patman Act, provides in relevant part: ""It shall be unlawful for 
any person . . . to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality . . . where the 
effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or 
to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such 
discrimination, or with customers of either of them."" 38 Stat. 730, as amended, 49 Stat. 1526, 15 U.S.C. § 13(a). "
1066,2," Additionally, on more than 12 other occasions, Volvo offered worse deals to Reeder than it gave to dealers who made 
comparable purchases.  Arguably due to Volvo's stingy concessions, Reeder failed to close with its customers in these instances 
and thus never ended up buying the trucks at issue from Volvo."
1066,3," Similarly, and despite its selective discussion of the extensive evidentiary record,  ante, at 170-173, 163 L. Ed. 2d, at 671-673, 
126 S. Ct. 860, the Court does not question the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury's finding that Volvo engaged in 
price discrimination against Reeder relative to other regional Volvo dealers for a significant period of time. "
1067,4," Indeed, if Volvo's argument about the meaning of ""purchaser,"" see  ante, at 179-180, 163 L. Ed. 2d, at 677-678, 126 S. Ct. 860, 
ultimately meets with this Court's approval, then the Robinson-Patman Act will simply not apply in the special-order context.  Any 
time a special-order dealer fails to complete a transaction because the high price drives away its ultimate customer, there will be 
no Robinson-Patman violation because the dealer will not meet the ""purchaser"" requirement, and any time the dealer completes 
the transaction but at a discriminatorily high price, there will be no violation because the dealer has no ""competition"" (as the 
majority sees it) for that specific transaction at the moment of purchase."

1076,1," ""COCO"" is used in these Findings and Conclusions to identify recitals or summaries of specific information contained in 
documents or deposition testimony designated by UAC or third parties as ""Confidential-Outside Counsel Only"" under the terms 
of the September 8, 2005 Agreed Protective Order, or contained in testimony given at the preliminary injunction hearing when 
persons to whom the Agreed Protective Order prohibited disclosure of information designated ""Confidential-Outside Counsel 
Only"" were excused from the courtroom. Most of the portions of these Findings and Conclusions that are identified by the term 
""COCO"" recite or summarize ""Confidential-Outside Counsel Only"" deposition testimony of three UAC witnesses whose entire 
transcripts UAC designated as ""Confidential-Outside Counsel Only."" "
1103,2," UAC's proposed Findings 25-28 attempt to rely on the copyright license decisions in Storage Tech. Corp. v. Custom Hardware 
Eng'g & Consulting, Inc., 421 F.3d 1307, 1316-17 (Fed. Cir. 2005) and Hogan Sys., Inc. v. Cybresource Int'l, Inc., 158 F.3d 319, 
322-23 (5th Cir. 1996) as purportedly supporting its access to Avaya's MSP software. But those cases provide no comfort, to 
UAC, for in each instance the court's analysis rested on language in the license agreement that authorized such access, while 
Avaya granted no such authorization in its personal and nonassignable licenses. "
1111,1," While the Court has significantly discounted the award sought by Defendants, it recognizes that even the reduced amount of 
over $ 80,000 in fees and costs will result in financial hardship to Plaintiff's counsel and his law practice. In this regard, however, 
the Court believes it important to recall that, at the initial pretrial conference in this case, the Court expressed serious 
reservations about the merits of Plaintiff's claims and questioned whether Plaintiff's counsel had the experience and resources to 
see a complex federal antitrust case through to a successful conclusion. "
1132,1," Doc. 158 is actually defendants' joint memorandum in support of the motion to dismiss. The motion to dismiss itself was never 
actually filed, but the court granted defendants leave to file the motion out of time (Doc. 161) and therefore the motion itself (Doc. 
159, Ex. A) is hereby deemed filed. Nonetheless, because the motion itself was not in fact filed, the court's case management 
system does not reference it as a pending motion. Instead, the court's case management system reflects that the memorandum 
is the pending motion. For that reason, the court is using the case management system's reference to Doc. 158."
1132,2," HN1[
] Consistent with the well established standard for evaluating a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the court accepts as true all well pleaded factual allegations in plaintiffs' complaint. "
1135,3, The court will discuss plaintiffs' allegations with respect to Lyondell in more detail below. 
1136,4," The court will not address defendants' conscious parallelism argument because plaintiffs have clarified that they are not 
attempting to support their conspiracy allegation through an assertion of parallel pricing. Nonetheless, given plaintiffs' allegations 
of defendants' interrelated pricing, the court can envision that this issue may arise again during the course of this litigation. To 
that end, the court wishes to clarify that it is not inclined to adhere to that aspect of this court's holding in In re Universal Service 
Fund Telephone Billing Practices Litigation, 300 F. Supp. 2d 1107 (D. Kan. 2003), that a plaintiff relying on a theory of conscious 
parallelism must also allege a plus factor. In that case, the court was not confronted with some of the well reasoned arguments 
advanced by the plaintiffs in this case. Additionally, in the Universal Service Fund case this court relied on the district court's 
reasoning in Twombly v. Bell Atlantic Corp., 313 F. Supp. 2d 174 (S.D.N.Y. 2003), which was subsequently reversed by the 
Second Circuit in light of the liberal notice pleading standards of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Twombly v. Bell Atl. 
Corp., 425 F.3d 99, 114-17 (2d Cir. 2005). The court does note, however, that in the Universal Service Fund case the plaintiffs' 
allegations were sufficient to satisfy the ""plus factor"" element in any event. "
1137,5," Of course, defendants are free to challenge these amended allegations by a renewed motion to dismiss should they deem it 
appropriate to do so. "
1143,1," The parties refer to this requirement as ""the membership rule."""
1143,2," HN3[
] Private persons are given a cause of action under the Sherman Act by Section 4 of the Clayton Act, which provides for a suit to recover treble damages by any person injured in his business or property by the violation of the antitrust laws. Section 
16 of the Clayton Act allows injured parties to sue for injunctive relief. "
1146,3," There are eight other associations that plaintiffs claim are ""competitors"" of local Realtor(R) associations. These are discussed 
below in regard to the market foreclosure issue. However, Edwards does not claim that but for the tie at issue here she would 
join any of these other groups."
1146,4," In his treatise, Professor Areeda explains that there is no cognizable anticompetitive effect where the buyer proceeds in 
defiance of an attempted restraint and purchases a competing product: For example, dealers required to stock a manufacturer's full line would not be foreclosed to rival sellers at all if they would 
not stock a second brand in any event or only minimally if they stock other brands anyway. Phillip E. Areeda, Antitrust Law, § 1769e1, at 440 n. 48 (1996) (emphasis added). For this reason, plaintiffs' citation to Barber & Ross Co. v. Lifetime Doors, Inc., 810 F.2d 1276 (4th Cir. 1987), is inapposite. 
There, the plaintiff was foreclosed, by virtue of defendant's tying arrangement, from purchasing certain products from other 
suppliers that it otherwise would have purchased. Id. at 1279 n. 1. Here, Edwards wished to join, and did join, another 
association, notwithstanding the requirement that she join a Realtors(R) association. She thus has not been harmed by any such 
anticompetitive effect. "
1147,5," An individual real estate agent was also a plaintiff and also found to have standing. However, the First Circuit based its 
conclusion that he had standing on the fact that he had been denied access to the MLS and had suffered injury to his business 
as a result. Id. at 1572. Here, Edwards has never been denied access to the NKMLS and thus can show no comparable injury."
1147,6," Again, it is important to note that the NKMLS does not require that its participants join the NKAR in order to gain access to the 
MLS. Rather, membership in any local association of Realtors(R) will suffice. As previously noted, in 2003, NKMLS gave access 
to its MLS to 285 real estate brokers who belonged to Realtors(R) associations other than the NKAR. "
1149,7," Given that the lack of antitrust injury is fatal to plaintiffs' claims, the court will not address defendants' alternative, independent 
arguments for summary judgment."
1149,8," The standing analysis discussed above applies equally to plaintiffs' boycott claim, that is, they lack standing to bring such a 
claim because they have suffered no antitrust injury."

reasons for Realtors(R) board membership requirements). "
1157,1," Defendant ISC cites to several cases to support its position that plaintiff lacks the ""necessary predicate"" for an antitrust injury. 
The court finds the cases so cited distinguishable from the facts as presented herein in that the injuries alleged by Kentucky 
Speedway are reflective of the anti-competitive effect of the alleged anti-competitive acts, and are the type of losses likely to be 
caused by the claimed violations. See generally CTUNIFY, Inc. v. Nortel Networks, Inc., 115 Fed. Appx. 831 (6th Cir. 2004);

1173,7," The relevant portions of T.C.A. § 65-37-103 (Supp. 2005) are included in the August 3, 2005 and August 8, 2005 letters filed 
with this Court, see supra. However, in the interest of clarity, we include the full text of the statute here: HN5[
] (a)(1) The Tennessee regulatory authority (TRA) shall retain regulatory jurisdiction established in this title for 
specific, individual telecommunications services. Except as provided in this section, the TRA shall not assert regulatory 
jurisdiction over the retail offering of combinations or bundles of products or services, whether or not such combinations or 
bundles of products or services are subject to a tariff or other regulatory filing with the TRA as of May 28, 2005, and 
whether or not comprised of products or services provided by a local exchange carrier alone or with another company. 
Nothing in this section shall require any company to engage in joint marketing with another company when it does not 
choose to do so. (2) In order to transition to the changes in regulatory jurisdiction established by this part, telecommunications carriers shall 
provide customers with the following notice, as part of the terms and conditions for bundles or combinations: ""This offer 
contains telecommunications services that are also available separately. Should you desire to purchase only the 
telecommunications services included in this offer, without additional products or services, you may purchase those 
telecommunications services individually at prices posted on [company website] or filed with the Tennessee Regulatory 
Authority."" (3) The TRA shall issue a statewide public service announcement, no less than once per year, to inform Tennesseans that 
telecommunications services they purchase may be available at different prices, depending upon whether they are bought 
individually or bought bundled, and to inform Tennesseans that functionally equivalent services may be available from 
providers who do not offer service using wire line technology. Scripts for these announcements shall be posted for 
comments from industry and consumers or their representatives before being used and shall not favor any one provider or 
technology over others. (b) Unless otherwise agreed by the end-user, the terms and conditions established by tariffs or other filings at the TRA for 
combinations or bundles of products or services shall remain effective as to end-users who have selected such 
combinations or bundles prior to May 28, 2005, for the duration of a term selected by the end-user. If no term was selected "
1174,," by the end-user for a combination or bundle of products or services, or if no term limit applied to such combination or 
bundle, then the terms and conditions governing that combination or bundle of products or services, at the time the end-
user subscribed, shall remain in effect until the end-user agrees or elects otherwise or until the end-user is noticed of a 
change in terms by the service provider. Terms and conditions originally established by approved tariffs, which are changed 
and noticed to customers subsequent to May 28, 2005, shall bind end-users. End-users who terminate service within thirty 
(30) days of issuance of the notice of a change in such terms and conditions shall not be affected by such changed terms 
and conditions for the period between issuance of the notice and termination of service. (c) Nothing in this section shall affect, alter or be construed to affect or alter the applicability of state or federal antitrust law 
or federal telecommunications law or the TRA's authority under federal telecommunications laws. (d) Any provider of local exchange service shall permit any end-user of basic local exchange telephone service to terminate 
that service upon request and shall take all administrative steps necessary, including ""number portability,"" as that term is 
used in 47 U.S.C. § 153(30), of the end-user's existing telephone number, to permit such end-user to begin receiving 
replacement service from another certificated provider in a timely manner. (e) Nothing in this section shall alter or expand the TRA's jurisdiction to hear complaints alleging price discrimination, as 
prohibited by Tennessee law, or anti-competitive practices regarding the provision of retail telecommunications services 
within its jurisdiction as its jurisdiction existed immediately prior to May 28, 2005, except to the extent that such jurisdiction 
is reduced pursuant to exemption by the TRA subsequent to May 28, 2005. This chapter does not confer jurisdiction on the 
TRA relating to services outside its jurisdiction as of May 28, 2005. In evaluating claims of anti-competitive practices in any 
retail telecommunications services market, the TRA shall apply applicable federal or state law and shall consider all 
relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the following: (1) The geographical and economic extent of commercial demand for functionally-equivalent services; (2) The number and relative longevity of companies providing functionally-equivalent services; (3) The relative gain or loss of revenues attributable to functionally-equivalent services and customers who purchase 
functionally-equivalent services; (4) The relative increase or decrease in facilities-based investment attributable to providing functionally-equivalent services; (5) The degree to which marketing, pricing and business strategies are utilized to acquire or maintain revenues attributable 
to functionally-equivalent services and customers who purchase functionally-equivalent services; and (6) The relationship between pricing policies and costs of functionally-equivalent services. (f) Nothing in this section shall alter the TRA's jurisdiction to review price regulation filings or conduct rate of return 
ratemaking analysis, as applicable, for incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) telecommunications providers. Revenue for 
telecommunications services provided in combinations or bundles shall be considered regulated revenue for purposes of 
price regulation or rate of return rate analysis. "

1196,9," In any event, HN7[
] monopolization does not require predatory pricing. LePage's, 324 F.3d at 152."
1196,10," Contrary to J & J's assertion, the courts have not dismissed the theory of monopoly leveraging where the leveraging produces 
actual or potential monopoly power in the leveraged market. Verizon Communications Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, 
LLP, 540 U.S. 398, 415 n.4, 124 S. Ct. 872, 157 L. Ed. 2d 823 (2004) (""To the extent the Court of Appeals dispensed with a 
requirement that there be a ""dangerous probability of success' in monopolizing a second market, it erred""; emphasis supplied; 
citation omitted); Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. United Airlines, Inc., 948 F.2d 536, 547 (9th Cir. 1991) (HN8[
] ""a plaintiff cannot establish a violation of Section 2 without proving that the defendant used its monopoly power in one market to obtain, or attempt 
to attain, a monopoly in the downstream, or leveraged, market""; emphasis supplied). J & J arguably has actual or potential 
market power in both the trocar and suture markets."
1196,11," It is worth noting that trocars and sutures are not complementary products, and there is no inherent reason for offering them 
together."
1196,12," There are several reasons for including share-based discount in the analysis. First, as noted in text, Applied is entitled to 
consideration of all J & J's conduct. Second, J & J has admitted market power. The cases cited for the proposition that a 
monopolist offering a multi-product bundle may engage in such pricing with impunity are factually wide of the mark. In Western 
Parcel Express v. United Parcel Service of America, Inc., 190 F.3d 974, 975 (9th Cir. 1999), the district court found that Western 
had failed to establish market power, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed. The validity of UPS's discount scheme is irrelevant. In 
Concord Boat Corp. v. Brunswick Corp., 207 F.3d 1039, 1044, (8th Cir. 2000), Brunswick had 75% of the stern drive engine 
market, and offered a share-discount program which the Eighth Circuit found lawful. However, Concord Boat dealt with a single 
product, and the Eight Circuit found unpersuasive the bundling cases which J & J discusses, such asLePage's andSmithKline. 
(Id. at 1062.) See note 3, supra. "
1197,13," J & J's contention that bundling produced lower prices begs the issue if the so-called lower prices were higher than would 
obtain in the absence of bundling."
1197,14," If practices challenged under Section 2 were initiated in the absence of actual or incipient market power, those practices would 
not necessarily enjoy immunity from a claim that they nevertheless unreasonably restrained trade. "
1209,1," If we understand Judge Wood's invocation of Marrese v. Am. Acad. of Ortho. Surgeons, 470 U.S. 373, 105 S. Ct. 1327, 84 L. 
Ed. 2d 274 (1985) and the point that a state judgment might ""in some circumstances have a preclusive effect"" on a subsequent 
federal action, as to claim preclusion (as we note above), this is certainly not the case in California. On the other hand, 
preclusion of federal issues by a prior state judgment will certainly not be avoided by tolling the federal statute of limitations and 
delaying the federal lawsuit. As to the possibility that a federal suit will never be brought, the statute of limitations applicable to 
such a suit is, of course, irrelevant in the circumstances. But if the problem is that preclusion principles may ultimately provide an 
affirmative defense to a federal suit, this is certainly not a reason to toll the federal statute of limitations and delay the filing of a 
federal action. "
1210,2," This, of course, is not to say that a state statute of limitations implicated by a federal class action might not be tolled under 
American Pipe. See, e.g., May v. AC&S, 812 F. Supp. 934, 938 (E.D. Mo. 1993). That, of course, is not the issue here. The 
question here is claimed to be whether the limitations attaching to a federal statute may be tolled to improve the efficiency of a 
state class action. As we have noted, there is no efficiency gain here and no federal interest in tolling. "
1217,1," A detailed breakdown of the tolling process for Southwire's case may help. Starting with June 14, 1996, Southwire used up 24 
days before Heliotrope I began on July 8, 1996. It then used up another 606 days between the October 10, 1997, denial of class 
certification and June 8, 1999, when the Loeb I litigation against Sumitomo and Global began. Another 858 days elapsed from 
the August 24, 2000, rejection of the Loeb I class until it filed suit on December 30, 2002. The total number of days was 1488, in 
excess of the 1461 days in four years. "

1247,1," Although a number of discovery issues among the parties still exist, the parties to the instant motion represented to the Court in 
a conference call that no additional discovery was necessary to support or otherwise defend against the instant motions for 
summary judgment."
1247,2," The Plaintiff submits a substantial amount of evidence about what Todd Portune knew or suspected at the time, as well as his 
thoughts about what the Board would have done if the members had known particular facts about the Bengals's operations. 
Judicious as his thoughts might be, Mr. Portune's thoughts, opinions, and speculation are entirely irrelevant to this analysis. He 
was not on the Board at the time that the lease was negotiated or executed. "
1248,3," In the hearing held on the motion, however, Plaintiff's counsel Mr. Chesley seemed to retreat from this position. As he closed, 
he indicated that the Court was required to review the entire record before it and that, regardless of a non-movant's failure to 
respond to a motion for summary judgment, that ""the burden of establishing the nonexistence of a material fact dispute always 
rests with the mover"" (doc. 171). He then stated that: Your Honor, I submit, and Mr. Markovits will go into more detail, and I have listened to where [the Defendants] are coming 
from, but, Your Honor, to suggest that there is not one material fact on the issue of statute of limitations or fraudulent "
1249,," concealment, and that's why I used as an example the Baltimore situation to give clear evidence, and we are entitled to the 
inference in those things that flow (Id.). Co-counsel Mr. Markovits also appeared to retreat from the contention that the Board was entitled to summary judgment on 
this issue, instead apparently contending that there were facts supporting fraudulent concealment warranting submission to a 
jury: ""What I'm about to show is that we do have the facts to put at issue their fraudulent concealment, their misrepresentations 
about economic viability, and all the other elements of fraudulent concealment"" (Id.) In his closing, Mr. Markovits, however, 
reiterated that Plaintiff believes it is entitled to summary judgment in its favor as to this issue."
1249,4," The Plaintiff also suggests, as its predecessor did in response to the earlier motion to dismiss, that it suffered no economic 
injury when the lease itself was signed; it contends that the actual antitrust injury occurred only after the Bengals began 
occupying the stadium under the terms of the lease and, therefore, that the statute of limitations would only begin to run at that 
time. If this proposition were accepted, then the filing of the instant suit would have occurred within the four year statute of 
limitations, and the issue of whether fraudulent concealment of the claim occurred would be entirely moot. Plaintiff, however, has 
advanced no argument that would cause this Court to reconsider its earlier ruling with respect to this issue. As it noted in its prior 
Order: [Plaintiff's] argument, however, seems foreclosed by applicable Sixth Circuit law. In general, ""the focus is on the timing of 
the causes of injury, i.e., the defendant's overt acts, as opposed to the effects of the overt acts."" Peck v. General Motors 
Corp., 894 F.2d 844, 849 (6th Cir.1990) (per curiam). Furthermore, although [Plaintiff] might attempt to frame it as a 
""continuing conspiracy"" to perpetuate the antitrust injury, that opportunity seems foreclosed as well. An overt act that would 
reset the statute of limitations under this theory must be a ""new and independent act that is not merely a reaffirmation of a 
previous act"" and that ""inflict[s] new and accumulating injury on the plaintiff."" DXS, Inc. v. Siemens Medical Systems, Inc., 
100 F.3d 462, 467 (6th Cir. 1996); see also Martinez v. Western Ohio Health Care Corp., 872 F. Supp 469, 472 (S.D. Ohio) 
(Rice, C.J.). Accordingly, ""even when a plaintiff alleges a continuing violation, an overt act by the defendant is required to 
restart the statute of limitations…."" DXS, 100 F.3d at 467. Accordingly, this ""injury"" - if it may be so framed - occurred when 
the lease was executed. This overt act fixed the amount of compensation that the county would receive; all that remained 
was the collection thereof. These economic results are precisely the type of ""rippling effect"" that the Peck court determined 
could not serve as an ""overt act"" for statute of limitations purposes. Peck, 894 F.2d at 849. (doc. 27). It is also worth noting that the evidentiary materials submitted by the parties in this case clearly reveal that, under the 
terms of the lease, Hamilton County had a number of immediate obligations to prepare the stadium for occupancy by the 
Bengals. It would be difficult to comprehend that - even accepting the Plaintiff's argument as true - that such required 
expenditures would not constitute an immediate economic injury as of the signing of the lease. In any case, the Board fails, 
despite the wealth of evidence produced in this case, to articulate any subsequent ground or additional ""overt act"" subsequent to 
the signing of the lease by any of the Defendants that might arguably have restarted the statute of limitations. Given that 
shortcoming, the Court cannot substitute its speculation for evidence in this case. Because the ""timing of the defendants' overt 
acts [rather than] the timing of the plaintiff's injuries. . .controls the statute of limitations issue,"" the Court has little difficulty 
concluding that there is no question that the statute of limitations began running as of the execution of the lease. Peck, 894 F.2d 
at 849. "
1250,5," Although not addressed in the briefing, Plaintiff's counsel conceded this requirement during oral argument on these motions: THE COURT: Now it seems to me that to establish the claim of fraudulent concealment you have got two basic elements 
that have to be found. First, what are the essential elements of a cause of action for fraud or fraudulent concealment? And, 
secondly, when does the cause of action accrue so that the statute of limitations starts to run? Can you address that? MR. MARKOVITS: Sure. The elements of fraudulent concealment are wrongful concealment by defendants, a failure of 
plaintiffs to discover the operative facts, and plaintiff's due diligence. When - when it's - the fraudulent concealment doctrine 
tolls the statute of limitations. THE COURT: And there's reliance in there, too, isn't there? MR. MARKOVITS: Excuse me? THE COURT: There has to be reliance by the person who claims he was snookered? MR. MARKOVITS: That's not presented as an element, but presumably there has to be some reliance. And that's the 
Dayco case out of the Sixth Circuit, Your Honor. That's not the model instructions. It's Sixth Circuit law. And that's 
presumably what a jury would be instructed here. So those are the elements of wrongful concealment. (doc. 171). The legal precision of the term ""snookered"" notwithstanding, Plaintiff has admitted that binding Sixth Circuit 
precedent also requires reliance upon allegedly fraudulent statements before fraudulent concealment may be established. See, 
e.g., Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Diamond Time, Ltd., 371 F.3d 883, 891 (6th Cir. 2004); ADD. While a grant of summary judgment 
in this case would be appropriate even were this element not required, it lends additional support to this Court's conclusion as 
explained infra. "
1251,6," Many of the background facts articulated in the Complaint -- such as those surrounding the development of free agency and 
the efforts to secure new stadia across the country -- are uncontested by the parties. As such -- to the extent they are relevant -- 
the Court incorporates them herein. "
1252,7," Much of the Board's Complaint, as well as its briefing on the current motions, is spent detailing the intrigue leading up to its 
dispute with Defendants. While it may be relevant in demonstrating that the Defendants engaged in unlawful anticompetitive 
activities, the vast majority of such discussion is irrelevant to the issue of whether the statute of limitations has expired for the 
federal cause of action arising from such activities."
1252,8," Plaintiff argues that the salary cap each year is a percentage of revenues shared among league owners, such as broadcast 
fees, ticket revenues, and licensing fees. As a result, the Plaintiff argues that owners focused on expanding nonshared revenues 
to enhance their own bottom lines; stadium deals such as that at issue in this case was the primary method for doing so. This 
issue will be explored more fully infra."
1252,9," Carrie Davis, formerly taxpayer-Plaintiff, alleged that Brown and NFL stadium consultant Harrow actually devised the entire 
funding scheme in a manner that would rest most favorably with Hamilton County taxpayers. In particular, she cites sections 
from Rick Harrow's book, When the Game Is On the Line, where he claims that Mike Brown and he, after conducting extensive "
1253,," polls of Hamilton County voters, ""decided to propose a sales tax…."" They organized a campaign to enact this tax by integrating 
it with other proposals that local voters would support. Harrow outlined the strategy in his book: In fact, the marketing literature said, ""It's not about sports."" I emphasized public schools, property tax relief, the prospect of 
new jobs, and the estimated $ 295 million annually pumped into the local economy. Brochures featured a photograph of a 
wholesome boy, hat tilted on his head, with a milk stain around his mouth. The milk, then, became the carrot, the promise 
of the right community values. (doc. 20). The decision to emphasize these elements, rather than the benefit of retaining the team, was the result of extensive 
polling indicating that these issues were the ones truly capable of motivating taxpayers to support the stadium issue."
1253,10," In its motion, the Defendants contend that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine prevents many, if not all, of the public comments 
made by Bengals officials and representatives from being considered as potentially misleading or fraudulent statements in 
proving fraudulent concealment in this case. HN11[
] Such doctrine prevents statements made in the course of ""attempting to 
influence the passage or enforcement of laws"" from serving as the basis for violations of the federal antitrust laws. Eastern 
Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 135, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961). While this 
proposition is generally true, it has substantial limitations, some of which arguably apply to this case. F. Buddie Contracting, Inc. 
v. Seawright, 595 F. Supp. 422 (N.D. Ohio 1984). Furthermore, many of the media comments cited either occurred well before 
or after the sales tax measure that constitutes the ""legislation"" in this case, rendering the doctrine largely inapplicable here. 
However, even if the Court would consider every single statement advanced by the Board, as the Court does in the analysis 
infra, they would be insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the statute of limitations should be tolled 
in this case. "
1254,11," In negotiating Cleveland's right to a new or existing franchise, Cleveland officials sought the NFL's agreement that the Bengals 
would be precluded from moving to Cleveland. The NFL refused to consent to this condition."
1254,12," The Plaintiff contends that both of these individuals have ongoing relationships with the NFL and/or NFL member teams, 
rendering the value of their advice - and their motivation during the negotiation - somewhat suspect. It does not, however, offer 
specifics in making this charge."
1254,13," In fact, as the Plaintiff notes, this goal serves as one of the overriding purposes of the lease, as stated in its opening recital: By public vote on March 19, 1996, the citizens of Hamilton County passed a one-half percent increase in the Hamilton 
County general sales tax to keep competitive and viable major league football… by, among other things, the construction of 
a new football stadium in Hamilton County. "
1255,, (doc. 128).
1255,14," This view was echoed by Zeits, Neyer, Bedinghaus, and Krings in their respective depositions. Perhaps somewhat indicative 
of the thought given this process, however, was Krings's response to the inquiry of what he understood ""economically viable"" to 
mean: ""whatever it took to keep [the team] in town"" (doc. 123)."
1255,15," Arguably the most damning evidence against the Bengals on this issue is a letter dated February 13, 1996 sent from Katherine 
B. Blackburn, Esq. (""Blackburn"") on behalf of the Bengals organization to Bynoe. In light of the fact that the new Cleveland deal 
had elicited ""considerable talk and speculation in the press about how NFL dollars could be brought to bear on the Cincinnati 
stadium issue,"" Blackburn ostensibly thought it necessary to provide Bynoe with a copy of the interim agreement between 
Cleveland and the NFL (doc. 123). In her letter, she identified a few points that she felt ""stood out"" in it, including that the money 
the NFL was to contribute under the deal ""is intended to be repaid by whatever team ultimately ends up playing in Cleveland"" 
and that it was contingent upon a number of occurrences, including advance commitments to lease a certain percentage of the 
planned suites and club seats in the new stadium (Id.). She then indicated that the Bengals had been ""profoundly disappointed"" 
by the County's latest proposal, given that it had ""ignored"" a number of issues the team had identified as crucial (Id.). In this 
letter, however, she detailed the initial proposals offered by the County, and made numerous statements as to how they were 
unsatisfactory. "
1256,16," The Bengals organization has, in both their instant filings and in oral argument, suggested that it had such information 
available and would have provided it if the County had demanded it. In light of the demands made and the refusal tendered, this 
assertion is somewhat dubious."
1256,17," For example, a June 2, 1995 article in the Cincinnati Enquirer revealed that the Bengals were believed to generate ""between $ 
6-8 million"" in annual profits (doc. 123). Financial World published estimates of the NFL member teams' estimated profits and 
losses annually; the estimate of the Bengals' profits for 1996 was only off by approximately $ 800,000 ($ 10.1 million in 
estimated profit vs. $ 10.9 million in actual profits). In fact, as the Defendants note, one of the articles cited in their Second "
1257,," Amended Complaint containing public statements by Mike Brown that allegedly placed substantial pressure on the public and 
the County officials to execute the instant lease clearly states that, in 1993, ""the Bengals remain profitable"" (docs. 57, 123)."
1257,18," The most nonplussed answer to this line of questioning was offered by Krings: Q: During the course of the negotiations, was it your assumption that the Bengals were profitable? A: I don't know whether they were profitable or not. The assumption - Well, I guess the message that I believe that they 
were trying to deliver, since their revenues were low and that they have - since the revenues were low, there was less 
money available to do the things they needed to be both economically viable and viable on the field. (doc. 128). At best, this testimony reveals that he was relatively unconcerned about the Bengals' profits."
1257,19," As the Defendants note, this report contained, among other salient points, the following passage: The provision of ""major-league"" professional sports is characterized by monopoly. This restriction of the supply of 
professional sports franchises intensifies competition among metropolitan areas for the scarce franchises. One way in 
which this competition manifests itself is by shifting a major portion of stadium facility costs from the private professional 
sports team to the public sector. If Cleveland, Houston, or New Jersey will not build or offer more favorable financial terms 
on a new or existing football, baseball, or hockey stadium, perhaps Baltimore, Northern Virginia, or Nashville will. (doc. 123). "
1258,20," Defendants also note that current Commissioner Todd Portune - inarguably the initial impetus behind the initial suit - 
introduced voluminous materials detailing the NFL's alleged monopoly, including Congressional and expert testimony and 
information regarding the leases obtained from other cities, into the Cincinnati public record in January 1996 while a member of 
City Council. He also sponsored motions in 1995 and 1996 advancing allegations similar to those advanced in the instant suit. 
While he was not involved in the negotiations, and, therefore, his knowledge and/or opinions are largely irrelevant to the 
determination of the instant motion, he testified under oath that he was ""sure"" he brought these concerns to the attention of the 
County (doc. 123). Furthermore - and perhaps just as telling - he was unable to bring the instant suit until he had been on the 
Board for more than three years because he lacked the majority vote to do so, despite having all these concerns."
1258,21," In Zeits's words: ""We could have looked down the barrel of a loaded gun and decided not to negotiate the deal if we did, but if 
we did, we took our chances"" (doc. 128). "
1259,22," It is worth noting that, apparently, this information was discoverable and provided to the opposing party as part of an antitrust 
lawsuit, just as it was here. Accordingly, had the Board had such suspicions and chose to act on them, it would have been able 
to discover this same information - to the extent that they even thought it relevant - in the same way."
1259,23," Zeits's testimony provides: Q. Okay. And so it was your understanding at the time you were negotiating that the floor and ceiling of the salary caps 
were a percentage of DGR [""defined gross revenue""]; correct? A. Yes. Q. And that DGR included stadium revenues; correct? A. Yes. Q. And that's something that the NFL would have told you? A. That's something the NFL would have confirmed for sure, yeah. (doc. 128). "
1260,24," In its reply, the Plaintiff objects to the inclusion of Keenan's affidavit and testimony contained therein and argues that the Court 
may not consider it pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1). This is not correct. First, this additional information was provided to 
refute specific allegations advanced in the Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment - namely, that the Defendants had provided 
Hamilton County with false and fraudulent information. Second, and more to the point, Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1) does not address 
this information. It provides, in relevant part: HN12[
] A party that without substantial justification fails to disclose information required by Rule 26(a) or 26(e)(1), or to 
amend a prior response to discovery as required by Rule 26(e)(2), is not, unless such failure is harmless, permitted to use 
as evidence at a trial, at a hearing, or on a motion any witness or information so disclosed. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1). Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a), in turn, only defines that information required as an initial disclosure - of which 
this information is not arguably contained - while Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(1) only covers the need to supplement additional 
disclosures and responses. To be sure, the parties have objected to various items of discovery. However, it is not at all clear 
how the instant testimony is barred from consideration by the application of Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1), particularly in light of the 
fact that it is used to respond to a specific allegation by the Plaintiff. "
1261,25," It is again worth noting that the Board, the Plaintiff in the instant suit, is a continuous entity under state law. Although current 
members might not have been fully aware of the facts surrounding the negotiation of the lease, the knowledge of the Board 
members at the time of the execution of the lease is binding upon the current Board."
1261,26," The Plaintiff correctly has not contended that the Defendants were under any affirmative obligation to provide them with any 
material requested regarding the Bengals' financial condition or operations. See, e.g., Blon v. Bank One, Akron, N.A., 35 Ohio 
St. 3d 98, 101, 519 N.E.2d 363 (1988) (holding that parties to arm's-length business transactions have no general duty to 
disclose material facts to each other)."
1261,27," Furthermore, as discussed infra, the Plaintiff's contention that this statement revealed that the ""rule of reason"" was violated 
and gave rise to antitrust liability is untenable as a matter of law. If this is the sole basis upon which the Plaintiff urges that the 
statute of limitations be tolled, it is fatal to its claim. "
1262,28," Indeed, the Board's argument in this case necessarily implies that profits, rather than revenues, must be the proper frame of 
reference. For example, when it continually asserts that the Bengals could have been ""viable"" without the stadium deal given 
that the team was already, and remained, profitable, the question of the team's revenues is entirely irrelevant. While it may be 
arguable as to whether the Board's position is economically sound, it is entirely undisputed that none of the negotiating parties 
considered it to be the determinative or even a relevant issue. While the Board may question their collective wisdom, it may not 
create a question of fact as to their collective understanding and knowledge during the execution of the lease. "
1263,29," Although the Bengals were under no obligation to provide the information, a refusal to do so would more likely lead to an 
inference that information unfavorable to the Bengals' ownership or contrary to its assertions was being concealed than to the 
contrary."
1263,30," Furthermore, if the Plaintiff sought to benefit from Todd Portune's efforts in this regard, they have failed to plead any such 
efforts with the requisite particularity. See Dayco, 523 F.2d at 394. It is likely that it did not, however, because it recognized that 
they were immaterial or, at worst, damaging. He was not elected to the Board until November 2000, so any efforts were simply 
irrelevant to the Board's statute of limitations on the underlying lease. Second, it merely underscores the fact that he was a 
minority on the Board incapable of advancing the instant suit - despite suspicion and/or knowledge - on the Board's behalf. He 
ultimately brought the instant suit as a taxpayer suit. However, now that the Board has been substituted as Plaintiff, we must 
examine the Board's due diligence, rather than Portune's. "
1264,31," The Supreme Court also noted that when conspiracies to violate the antitrust laws are at issue, such as in Zenith, and 
purportedly in this case, ""each time a plaintiff is injured by an act of the defendants a cause of action accrues to him to recover 
the damages caused by that act and that, as to those damages, the statute of limitations runs from the commission of the act."" 
Zenith, 401 U.S. at 338. As noted supra, however, the Plaintiff has failed to identify or otherwise argue that any subsequent 
event in the relationship between the Board and the Defendants, other than perhaps the Bengals' occupancy of the lease, would 
serve as a subsequent overt act sufficient to give rise to liability. As for the occupancy of the stadium, no additional or 
subsequent damages arose that already were not expressly fixed by the terms of the lease executed by the parties. Accordingly, 
this cannot serve as an additional event. "
1271,1," Although the complaint does not explain how this minimum shipping charge was calculated, it implies that the minimum 
shipping charge was sufficient to cover actual costs of shipping by retailers and coupon processors. "
1277,1," Defendant has also brought its antitrust claim under Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 15.05(a) and (b). Because Texas's antitrust laws 
mirror the Sherman Act, courts have recognized the appropriateness of relying on federal case law in examining state antitrust 
claims. Accordingly, it is not necessary to discuss Defendant's state claims separately. See, e.g., DeSantis v. Wackenhut Corp., 
793 S.W.2d 670, 687, 33 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 517 (Tex. 1990)."
1277,2,"  Plaintiff urges that Defendant has failed to establish all of the elements of a per se illegal tying violation, which include that: (1) 
there are two separate products; (2) the two products are tied together or customers are coerced; (3) the supplier possesses 
substantial economic power over the tying product; (4) the tie has an anticompetitive effect on the tied market; and (5) the tie 
affects a not insubstantial volume of commerce. United Farmers Agents Ass'n v. Farmers Ins. Exch, 89 F.3d 233, 236 n.2 (5th 
Cir. 1996). While not deciding that Defendant has proved elements (1), (3), (4), or (5), the Court finds that Defendant has 
presented sufficient evidence to withstand a summary judgment for Plaintiff on its antitrust claim. "
1278,3," Both the Judge Judy and Judge Joe Brown license agreements provide that: Licensee acknowledges that the licensing of the Picture(s) specified in this Agreement has been separately negotiated and 
severally agreed upon; that the prices set forth herein represent fair value for the Picture(s); that Paramount did not directly 
or indirectly condition the granting of the license of any one or more of the Picture(s) upon Licensee agreeing to license any 
other series or picture(s); and that the licensing hereunder of more than one Picture is for the convenience of both 
Paramount and Licensee. Pl.'s Ex. A P 9; Pl's Ex. B P 9. "
1279,4, Defendant may separately recover damages for its antitrust counterclaim. 
1280,5," Though the Court does not reach Plaintiff's breach of contract claim for Becker because of disputed factual issues as to 
Defendant's antitrust defense, the Court's analysis of Plaintiff's breach of contract claims and Defendant's breach of contract 
defenses for Judge Joe Brown and The Parkers would likely also apply to the Becker license agreement."
1280,6," Plaintiff asserts that the license agreements contain a choice-of-law clause favoring California law. Defendant has not rebutted 
this. The Court need not decide whether California's or Texas's substantive law applies, however, since the law governing 
breach of contract claims is the same for both states. "
1282,7," The cases cited by Defendant are not applicable, as they deal with acceleration clauses or liquidated damages clauses in the 
context of leases for real property or other types of contracts that, in California, are subject to statutory rules for determining the 
validity of damages clauses. See, e.g., Ricker v. Rombough, 120 Cal. App. 2d Supp. 912, 261 P.2d 328, 329-30 (Cal. App. Dep't 
Super. Ct. 1953); Cal. Civ. Code § 1670-1671. "
1285,1," The Court conducted a hearing on SBC's motion on November 9, 2005. "
1286,2, Plaintiffs' response at 4.
1286,3," The plaintiff in Z-Tel was a CLEC, not a customer of SBC. "
1299,4," Even though SBC contends Plaintiffs' injunctive claim is moot because of the FCC Order and the filed rate doctrine thus 
mandates dismissal with prejudice of the complaint in its entirety, Plaintiffs have not had the opportunity to address the FCC 
Order in this regard nor has the Court addressed the issue. "

1335,3," “We liberally construe [plaintiffs’] notice of appeal from the order sustaining the demurrer, a nonappealable order, to be from 
the subsequent judgment of dismissal.” (Groves v. Peterson (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 659, 666, fn. 2 [123 Cal. Rptr. 2d 164].) "
1336,4," We commend the Attorney General and Consumer Attorneys of California for the excellent amicus curiae briefs submitted by 
each in this appeal. "
1339,5," In In re Firearm Cases (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 959 [24 Cal. Rptr. 3d 659], the appellate court focused on whether the 
challenged practice in a consumer UCL action caused substantial injury. The appellate court held, “[a]lthough the weighing test 
of the pre-Cel-Tech cases remains useful, the challenged practice must be the likely cause of substantial injury. [Citation.] The 
latter element was not supported by the plaintiffs' showing in this case.” (Id. at p. 981.) "
1340,6," In Progressive West Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, supra, 135 Cal.App.4th at page 287, the appellate court stated, “[t]he balancing 
test required by the unfair business practice prong of [Business and Professions Code] section 17200 is fact intensive and is not 
conducive to resolution at the demurrer stage. ‘ “[U]nfairness” is an equitable concept that cannot be mechanistically determined 
under the relatively rigid legal rules applicable to the sustaining or overruling of a demurrer.’ ” Progressive West is 
distinguishable from our case because the complaint in that case alleged, inter alia, that the insurance company engaged in a 
practice of demanding 100 percent of the money it had paid out to policyholders under “med-pay coverage” without regard to its 
own obligations. (Id. at p. 286.) Such a practice, the appellate court held, “fits the language often used in conjunction with unfair 
business practices as ‘ ?immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers.” [Citation.]’ ” 
(Ibid.) Here, as discussed ante, the second amended complaint is devoid of allegations which state a basis for claiming DCC 
engaged in an unfair business practice under Smith, supra, 93 Cal.App.4th 700. "
1342,7," We may affirm the trial court's order sustaining the demurrer for failure to allege facts sufficient to state a claim, based on the 
application of the definition of “unfair” not relied upon by the trial court. “We affirm the judgment if it is correct on any ground 
stated in the demurrer, regardless of the trial court's stated reasons.” (Wolkowitz v. Redland Ins. Co. (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 
154, 162 [5 Cal. Rptr. 3d 95].) "
1343,8," No party in this case raised the issue of the impact of Proposition 64 on this analysis. As we discuss, the second amended 
complaint did not sufficiently allege a UCL claim even based on the “fraud” prong as defined before the passage of Proposition 
64. Therefore, we do not need to address the applicability of Proposition 64 to this case. "
1347,1, This claim is asserted in Count I of the proposed second amended complaint.

] Whether a plaintiff has standing to bring an antitrust claim is the initial inquiry in antitrust cases.  Maranatha Temple, Inc. v. Enter. Prods. Co., 893 S.W.2d 92, 105 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1994, writ denied) (citing  Jayco Sys., Inc. v. Savin 
Bus. Machs. Corp., 777 F.2d 306, 313 (5th Cir. 1985)). The issue of standing to bring an antitrust claim is a question of law. See 
id. (citing  Eagle v. Star-Kist Foods, Inc., 812 F.2d 538, 539 (9th Cir. 1987)). The party bringing an antitrust claim ""must be either "
1361,," a consumer of the alleged violator's goods or services or a competitor of the alleged violator"" in the market. Id. (citing  Eagle, 
812 F.2d at 540;  Bell v. Dow Chem. Co., 847 F.2d 1179, 1183 (5th Cir. 1988) (holding that ""consumers and competitors . . . are

nor a competitor"" in the market)). We note that Southwestern Bell's standing argument is unusual insofar as it is not premised on the general standing 
requirements for antitrust cases.HN15[
]  Federal antitrust law imposes a threshold standing requirement upon persons seeking liability for antitrust violations.  Scott v. Galusha, 890 S.W.2d 945, 950 (Tex. App.-Fort Worth 1994, writ denied) (citing  
Bowen v. Wohl Shoe Co., 389 F. Supp. 572, 578 (S.D. Tex. 1975)). There is a two-pronged test to examine whether a plaintiff 
has proper antitrust standing. Id. (citing  Todorov v. DCH Healthcare Auth., 921 F.2d 1438, 1448 (11th Cir. 1991)). A court 
should first determine whether the plaintiff suffered an antitrust injury, and second, the court should determine whether the 
plaintiff is an efficient enforcer of the antitrust laws, which requires analysis of the directness or remoteness of the plaintiff's 
injury. Id. (citing  Todorov, 921 F.2d at 1449). "

permissible temporal scope of the Damage Period."" Reasoned Award at 22 n.13, Vol. IV at 874. "
1376,6," The panel also granted Midlothian relief on B-S Steel's additional claim under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act. B-S 
Steel did not raise that claim in its amended complaint, and it is therefore not at issue here."
1376,7," The final order granting summary judgment on all claims was entered on July 29, 2004. "
1377,8," We note that B-S Steel has not indicated that it is appealing the district court's order confirming the award. Thus, we need not 
determine whether this court has jurisdiction over such an appeal. See Denver & Rio Grande W. R.R. Co., 119 F.3d at 848 
(holding that this court has jurisdiction when the appellant has filed a docketing statement, indicating an intent to appeal a 
particular order, within the time for filing an appeal)."
1377,9," While the district court applied a Texas choice of law provision in the 1997 Conditions of Sale when construing the contractual 
validity of the arbitration agreement, the parties at times refer to Kansas law, perhaps recognizing the logical flaw inherent in 
applying a contractual choice of law provision before determining whether the underlying contract is valid. We need not consider 
the matter further, however, as our conclusion would be the same under either Kansas or Texas law. "
1379,10," The district court's mischaracterization appears to result from the assumption that the calculation of damages for a certain 
month took into account Midlothian's sales either to B-S Steel or to its competitors during that month. This assumption is 
unwarranted because, as discussed above, the damages models presented measured the latter companies' overall sales and 
profits during the applicable time period, not their purchases from a particular supplier during that time period. The latter figure 
was simply not involved in the calculation."
1379,11," See 18 Wright, Miller & Cooper, Federal Practice & Procedure § 4417, at 429 (observing that in the situation of ""basically

customer evidence). Significantly, the arbitrators observed that B-S Steel simply ""did not develop, to any significant degree, 
empirical data or evidence obtained from either competing steel service centers or from customers, choosing instead to develop 
its case through"" its alternative damages models. Id. at 17, Appellant's App. Vol. IV at 869. The arbitrators indicated that B-S 
Steel had the necessary data available but suggested that its choice not to use this data might be the result of ""'real world' 
business considerations . . . trumping the litigation process."" Id. at 17 n.9. Nevertheless, the arbitrators viewed this omission as 
raising the ""negative inference that, by having evidence available to it and not using it, such evidence might have undermined or 
defeated its claim."" Id. at 18 n.9, Appellant's App. Vol. IV at 870. Here as well, B-S Steel does not suggest that it wishes to 
present any actual data from the Favored Buyers or any additional evidence from customers in regard to the period at issue."

customers that it has increased purchases from Steel & Pipe during this period, and thus decreased purchases from B-S Steel, 
because of Steel & Pipe's lower prices. "

Midlothian that Midlothian refused to fill. In any case, our perception of B-S Steel's claims must be governed by the pretrial order.

the eastern United States, and ""that nationwide there would be up to $800 million in cost savings annually.""  369 F.3d 1108,

1565,4," Appellant relies heavily on some of our state action immunity cases involving the city of Detroit, but those cases can be readily 
distinguished from the alleged scheme here, and do not, therefore, represent any affirmation by us that the plaintiffs in those 
cases had alleged antitrust injury. In Michigan Paytel Joint Venture v. City of Detroit, 287 F.3d 527 (6th Cir. 2002), the plaintiffs 
alleged that the process by which the city solicited and accepted bids for a police telephone service violated Sections 1 and 2 of 
the Sherman Act. Although we dismissed that case on state action immunity grounds rather than a failure to state antitrust injury, 
that case does not represent an analogous situation to the instant case, for the alleged scheme involved two distinct products 
(construction of the network, and subsequent operation of telephone service) instead of the lone product here. As we stated, the 
""antitrust claims are based primarily on the allegation that Ameritech is engaged in a pattern of unlawful and/or anti-competitive 
conduct calculated to attempt to monopolize"" the telephone market. Id. at 534. Similarly, it is true that we dismissed on state 
action immunity grounds an antitrust claim involving the city of Detroit and a successful bidder to build a local cable television 
system, but that case, like Michigan Paytel, was brought under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, whereas, in our case, EMI 
limited its antitrust complaint to Section 1 of the Sherman Act. City Communs, Inc. v. City of Detroit, 888 F.2d 1081, 1088 (6th 
Cir. 1989). Finally, we chose to analyze as an immunity case Opdyke Inv. Co. v. City of Detroit, 883 F.2d 1265 (6th Cir. 1989). In 
that case, the plaintiffs alleged Sections 1 and 2 violations where Detroit and the private defendant agreed to build a hockey 
arena in Detroit, shirking the private defendant's informal agreement with the plaintiff to build an arena in Pontiac. But it should 
be noted that we quoted, with approval, the district court's statement that ""The Court is . . . not convinced that this agreement 
constitutes an antitrust violation. The City merely out-negotiated plaintiff and offered the Norris Group a better deal."" Id. at 1272. 
Therefore, although we chose to decide these cases on immunity grounds, we did not thereby affirm that the plaintiffs had 
alleged antitrust injury. For the reasons stated above, we now believe that judicial economy dictates a quick look at the plaintiff's 
allegation of injury to determine whether it is potentially cognizable under the antitrust laws. "
1567,5," That court's reference to collusion or fraud left open the possibility that Kentucky courts might review procurement contracts 
where plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged that public officials themselves had acted in a corrupt manner. To analogize to the laws 
of agency, corporate governance, and sovereign immunity, there is a vital distinction to be made between an allegation that a 
public entity acted in some improper manner, and an allegation that public officials acted in a corrupt manner, and therefore ultra 
vires, in directing the actions of the public entity. In our case, EMI is not suing BCFC officials in their personal capacities for 
corrupt acts, nor has it alleged that BCFC officials acted in a personally corrupt manner when they awarded the masonry 
contract bids to DSM aside from a single allegation that one official should have recused himself from voting on the bids 
because of his conflict of interest with respect to a project that was tangentially related at best to the masonry contracts at issue 
here. Rather, EMI restricts its allegations of wrongdoing to the county's act, not to any ultra vires acts of its officials. For that 
reason, the allegations in this case do not qualify for the exception cited above."
1567,6," Our holding is bolstered by the fact that HN19[
] Kentucky law expressly restricts standing in public procurement cases to 
local taxpayers and citizens. HealthAmerica Corp. of Ky. v. Humana Health Plan, 697 S.W.2d 946, 948 (Ky. 1985). Such 
standing was left undisturbed by the Kentucky Supreme Court's ruling in Pendleton Bros. in jurisdictions that have not adopted "
1568,," the KMPC. In this case, plaintiff EMI is neither a taxpayer nor a resident of Boone County, and Boone County did not adopt the 
KMPC. Therefore, EMI would not have had standing under Kentucky law to challenge the BCFC's award of the bids to DSM, and 
so the company could not have reasonably expected to enjoy any property interest in the lost bids. "

1578,23," Id. In making this argument, the defendants contend that the import restrictions worked both ways, i.e., American vehicle 
exports to Canada were also curtailed. Thus, they hypothesize, during times when the value of the Canadian dollar 
strengthened, Canadian cars were more expensive than their American counterparts, and therefore the two named plaintiffs 
buying cars in the United States during this time were in essence protected from the market effect of more expensive Canadian 
prices by the two-way import restriction. When posed this scenario as a hypothetical at his deposition, the plaintiffs' expert 
agreed that a restriction on American imports to Canada during such a time could keep prices lower for American consumers. 
See id., App. Vol. V, Tab 31 (Dep. of Robert E. Hall (excerpts)) (""Hall Dep."") at 242-45, 248-49."
1578,24," The complaint does not state explicitly that any one of the named plaintiffs intends to purchase a motor vehicle in the future. 
Rather, it asserts more generally that ""because Defendants' combination and conspiracy is ongoing, Plaintiffs and members of 
the Class are threatened with similar injury in the future."" Fourth Am. Compl. P 81. Given that the defendants have not 
challenged this aspect of the plaintiffs' complaint, I read it liberally to infer the direct assertion. "
1579,25," In my Order of March 4, 2004 denying the defendants' Motion to Dismiss as to the injunctive claims, I held that ""the Amended 
Complaint . . . allege[s] that violations are continuous and will continue unless enjoined by this Court', which constitutes 
""irreparable injury"" remediable by an injunction. In re New Motor Vehicles, 307 F. Supp.2d at 144 n.10."

1579,27," This argument of no past injury may be a more significant issue for the 23(b)(3) state law damages class certifications. 
However, the defendants do not argue that these named representatives will never lease or buy (or do not intend to lease or 
buy) vehicles in the future, or that an American-Canadian exchange rate reversal has permanently cured the problem. 
Therefore, these named representatives are not disqualified from representing this injunctive class."
1579,28," See Defs.' Mem. at 49-50. The defendants refer to the ""vertical restrictions."" The plaintiffs have not challenged independent 
vertical restrictions, but a horizontal agreement that enhanced and strengthened the vertical restrictions. It is the horizontal 
agreement that is allegedly illegal. Presumably the defendants will argue on the merits that the conduct here is not per se illegal, 
but subject to a rule of reason approach (they said so at oral argument), and will seek to justify any horizontal agreement on that 
basis. "
1580,29,"  Valley Drug Co. v. Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 350 F.3d 1181 (11th Cir. 2003), cited by the defendants, does not compel a 
different result. The antitrust class certified in that case was a 23(b)(3) damages class, not a 23(b)(2) injunctive class. Id. at 
1184. A federal damages claim involves proof of actual economic injury. See 15 U.S.C. § 15 (""injur[y] in [] business or property""). 
By contrast, as I have already noted, an injunctive claim involves proof of threatened injury. See 15 U.S.C. § 26 (""threatened 
loss or damage""). The court's statement in Valley Drug that a""fundamental conflict exists where some party members claim to 
have been harmed by the same conduct that benefited other members of the class,"" Valley Drug, 350 F.3d at 1189, applies to 
damage recovery."

1582,40,"  The case cited by the defendants to support their argument, Christiana Mortg. Corp. v. Delaware Mortg. Bankers Ass'n, 136 
F.R.D. 372, 376 (D. Del. 1991), is inapposite. There the plaintiffs were suing for ""compensatory damages, treble damages, and 
punitive damages"" under three federal antitrust claims. Here, I have dismissed all federal damages claims. Therefore, the 
statement that ""it is generally inappropriate in an antitrust suit seeking treble damages to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(2),"" id. 
at 382, has no bearing. In addition, the plaintiffs' interest in injunctive relief in Christiana Mortgage Corp. was problematic. They 
did not allege that the defendants' acts were continuing: in fact, they could not, for the underlying violation stemmed from a one-
time-only circulation of materials calling for a boycott of the plaintiffs. Id. In this case, the plaintiffs do allege that the defendants' 
conduct is continuing. Fourth Am. Compl. P 97."
