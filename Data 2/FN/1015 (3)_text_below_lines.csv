30,2," The authorized dealer agreement reserved to Panasonic the right to ""solicit and make direct sales of the Products to anyone, 
anywhere, and to appoint additional dealers of the Products and/or distributors, sales agents or sales representatives for the 
Products . . . without any obligation to DEALER of any kind."" Ex. D to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. P 2."
30,3," A manufacturer's certificate is needed to make a bid. It is a certificate from the manufacturer or master distributor saying that 
the dealer is an authorized dealer of the product in good standing and that the manufacturer or master distributor will ensure that 
the conditions of the bid are satisfied."
30,4," NAP provides a vehicle for selected authorized Panasonic dealers to act as representatives of Panasonic for sales to 
governmental, educational, non-profit medical, and large commercial accounts. This program permits Panasonic to compete with 
products of other manufacturers at national and other levels where Panasonic determines that its direct involvement is desirable. 
Dealers who qualify as authorized representatives under NAP can bring potential customers to Panasonic for handling pursuant 
to NAP, with the dealer in that case acting as Panasonic's commissioned authorized representative for the sale from Panasonic 
to that customer. Alternatively Panasonic, upon identifying an appropriate NAP customer, can appoint one of the authorized NAP 
representatives to act as the representative in that sale. NAP has its own pricing structure for direct sales to the end use 
customer by Panasonic, using a NAP representative. "
31,5," Plaintiff's assertion, which this Court accepts as true for purposes of summary judgment, is that the decision to bid under NAP 
was made not by Mr. Velasquez, but rather by his superiors at Panasonic. "
32,6," HN3[
] The non-moving party may meet its burden through affidavit and deposition testimony, answers to interrogatories, 
and the like. See Ross v. Bank South, 837 F.2d 980, 999 (11th Cir. 1988). However, the mere verification by affidavit of one's 
own conclusory allegations is not sufficient to oppose a motion for summary judgment. Fullman v. Graddick, 739 F.2d 553, 557 
(11th Cir. 1984). Likewise, ""when a party has given clear answers to unambiguous questions which negate the existence of any 
genuine issue of material fact, that party cannot thereafter create such an issue with an affidavit that merely contradicts, without 
explanation, previously given clear testimony."" Van T. Junkins & Assoc. v. U.S. Industries, 736 F.2d 656, 657 (11th Cir. 1984)."
32,7," This standard mirrors the standard for a judgment as a matter of law (previously called a directed verdict) at trial. The question 
under each is the same: ""whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is 
so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law."" Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250-52."
32,8," Both parties agree that the rule of reason analysis, rather than the per se analysis used for certain more serious violations, is 
appropriate in this case. HN11[
] The rule of reason requires ""a weighing of the relevant circumstances of a case to decide 
whether a restrictive practice constitutes an unreasonable restraint on competition."" DeLong Equip. v. Washington Mills Abrasive 
Co., 887 F.2d 1499, 1507 (11th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1081, 110 S. Ct. 1813, 108 L. Ed. 2d 943 (1990) (quoting 
Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 761, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775, 104 S. Ct. 1464 (1984)). "
34,9," Du Pont involved an alleged violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act rather than § 1. However, the showing necessary under 
Section 2 to establish the existence of a relevant market is the same as that necessary under Section 1.  Barwick, 692 F. Supp. 
at 1348 (failure to meet burden of showing relevant market under Section 1 warranted summary judgment on Section 2 claim as 
well)."
34,10," Interestingly, in the context of one of its antitrust claims under the Robinson-Patman Act (discussed infra), SBC appears to 
assert that the appropriate relevant product market is the ""color copier market."" Am. Compl. P 54 (effect of Defendant's 
discrimination being to ""substantially lessen the competition offered by Plaintiff in the color copier market""). "
35,11," There appears to be a limited exception in this circuit to the requirement that two actual sales occur in order to constitute a 
Section 2(a) violation.  American Can Co. v. Bruce's Juices, Inc., 187 F.2d 919 (5th Cir.), cert. dismissed, 342 U.S. 875, 72 S. 
Ct. 165, 96 L. Ed. 657 (1951), cited by Plaintiff, establishes that ""where competitors in the same market are engaged in 
competitive purchasing and selling at the time of the price discrimination and where the failure of the plaintiff to consummate a 
second purchase of the item discriminatorily priced is directly attributable to defendant's own discriminatory practice,"" a second 
sale was not necessary.  M.C. Manufacturing Co., Inc. v. Texas Foundries, Inc., 517 F.2d 1059, 1067 n.17 (5th Cir. 1975), cert. 
denied, 424 U.S. 968, 47 L. Ed. 2d 736, 96 S. Ct. 1466 (1976). The Court concludes that the Bruce's Juices exception, "
36,," applicable to cases involving competitive purchasers at the same level of distribution, is not applicable to the factual situation 
present in this case."
36,12," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals adopted 
as binding precedent all of the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 
1981."
36,13," This section provides: HN25[
] It shall be unlawful for any person to discriminate in favor of one purchaser against another purchaser or purchasers 
of a commodity bought for resale . . . by contracting to furnish or furnishing . . . any services or facilities connected with the . . . 
handling, sale, or offering for sale of such commodity so purchased upon terms not accorded to all purchasers on proportionally 
equal terms."

37,14," The only exception under Georgia law to the rule that merger clauses are given effect comes into play when promissory fraud 
is alleged. When a plaintiff shows that the other party to a contract represented a fact or made a promise as an inducement for 
contracting, the plaintiff may either rescind the contract and sue in tort for deceit or affirm the contract and sue on the contract for 
breach (but may not do both).  Schlange, 767 F.2d at 792. As Plaintiff in the present case has not alleged promissory fraud and 
is clearly trying to sue on the contract for breach rather than rescinding the contract, this exception does not apply. "
43,1," Minor leagues of professional baseball are classified according to their level of ability and competition. The highest rating is 
AAA, that of the Triple-A Alliance. The lower ratings, in order of descending ability and competition, are AA, A, and rookie or 
instructional league. "
46,2," By its notice of motion, Triple-A joins in the American League's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's Title VII claim. 
Triple-A has not, however, complied with Local Rule 3(g), and this failure alone warrants denial of its motion. See S.D.N.Y. Civ. 
R. 3(g). Furthermore, Triple-A has not filed any affidavits in support of its motion. A movant for summary judgment ""always bears 
the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for the motion"" and identifying which materials ""demonstrate the 
absence of genuine issues of material fact."" Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265, 106 S. Ct. 2548 
(1986). Accordingly, Triple-A's motion for summary judgment is denied. "
47,3," Similar statements have been held to constitute direct evidence of discrimination. See Barbano v. Madison County, 922 F.2d 
139, 141 (2d Cir. 1990) (statement by interviewer that he would not consider ""some woman"" for the position constituted direct 
evidence of discrimination)."
47,4," The plaintiffs in Thurston sued under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the substantive provisions of which ""were 
derived in haec verba from Title VII."" The Supreme Court has ruled that interpretations of one statute apply with equal force to 
another.  Thurston, 769 U.S. at 121. "
48,5," Lowe v. Monrovia, 775 F.2d 998 (9th Cir. 1986), does not support Plaintiff's position because the majority found that there was 
a vacancy in the position for which the plaintiff applied.  Id. at 1006. "
49,6," In Luddington, the court considered whether the Act should be applied retroactively to a case on appeal from the district court's 
order granting summary judgment. The court ruled that ""the new act is applicable only to conduct engaged in after the effective 
dates (plural because several sections carry different effective dates) in the act, at least if the suit had been brought before the 
effective date."" 1992 U.S. App. 13450, at *14. That language, however, insofar as it applies to a case such as the instant one, 
which is still in its initial pre-trial stage in the district court, is dictum. Furthermore, at issue in Luddington was the retroactivity of the provision of the 1991 Act which overturned the Supreme Court's 
decision in Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 105 L. Ed. 2d 132, 109 S. Ct. 2363 (1989). That provision is clearly 
substantive insofar as it expands the definition of conduct actionable under § 1981. Here, by contrast, at issue is the retroactivity 
of provisions of the 1991 Act which are clearly remedial and procedural in nature. "
50,7,"  Triple-A has not shown that Plaintiff filed a charge against it with a local commission on human rights. Accordingly, its 
motion to dismiss based on § 297(9) must be denied. "
51,8,"  On July 15, 1991, § 297(9) was amended to provide, ""A complaint filed by the [EEOC] to comply with the requirements of 
42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(c) shall not constitute the filing of a complaint within the meaning of this subdivision."" The statute 
expressly provided that the amendment ""shall take effect immediately and shall apply to complaints filed with any federal 
commission on human rights on or after such date."" Accordingly, because Plaintiff filed her EEOC charges prior to July 15, 
1991, she may not benefit from the amendments."
51,9, 
51,9," New York Codes Rules and Regulations (""NYCRR"") § 465(d)(2)(vi) provides: (1) If the division finds that . . . noticing the complaint for hearing would be . . . undesirable, the division may, in its 
unreviewable discretion at any time prior to the taking of testimony at a public hearing . . ., dismiss the complaint on 
grounds of adminsitrative convenience. (2) The grounds for dismissal of a complaint for administrative convenience may include, but not be limited to, the following: (vi) the complainant has initiated or wants to initiate . . . court action based on the same grievance. "

198, 202-204 (C.C.S.D.N.Y. 1890), centers in the uniformity of player contracts; the confinement of the player to the club 
that has him under the contract; the assignability of the player's contract; and the ability of the club annually to renew the 
contract unilaterally, subject to the stated salary minimum."" Flood v. Kuhn, 407 U.S. 258, 259, 32 L. Ed. 2d 728, 92 S. Ct.

54,11,"  The court implied, however, that an antitrust claim brought by an umpire would be barred by the baseball exemption, 
stating, ""Radio broadcasting is not a part of the sport in the way in which players, umpires, and the league structure and the

62,2," Prior to Honickman's 1987 acquisition of its franchises and other assets, Seven-Up Brooklyn's franchise territory covered five 
counties in the New York metropolitan area: Kings (Brooklyn), Queens, Richmond (Staten Island), Nassau and Suffolk. AR 1151. 
Apart from Seven-Up, Seven-Up Brooklyn also held distribution franchises for A&W Root Beer, Perrier, Hawaiian Punch, 
Brownie, Canfields, and Lipton Tea. AR 4."
62,3," How Honickman acquired Seven-Up Brooklyn, and whether he sought to avoid filing premerger notification reports with the 
FTC as required by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, section 7A of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18A, are not issues before the Court."
62,4," The Settlement Agreement also included the Consent Order, an Agreement to Hold Separate, and an Addendum permitting 
Honickman to distribute on an interim basis the carbonated soft drinks formerly bottled and distributed by Seven-Up Brooklyn. "
63,5," In the alternative, the Consent Order provides that Honickman need not obtain prior Commission approval if he satisfies 
certain hold-separate requirements set forth in the Order and an attached Agreement to Hold Separate and divests the 
overlapping bottling operations that he already owns. AR 12-14, 19-27. "
64,6, The transcript indicates that Honickman's attorney declined the offer. AR 1485. 
65,7," By Order dated January 13, 1992, this Court granted in part and denied in part plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to Amend Their 
Complaint, and granted the FTC's Motion to Dismiss Count II. Plaintiffs amended their complaint to add a Count II which sought 
judicial review of FTC proceedings on Honickman's application to acquire licensing rights formerly held by the now-defunct New 
York Seven-Up Bottling Company pertaining to the distribution of carbonated soft drinks in New York, Bronx and Westchester 
counties. Because the FTC had yet to render a final decision granting or denying Honickman's application, the Court viewed the 
matter as unripe for judicial review and accordingly denied leave to amend to add this issue as part of Count II. Plaintiffs also 
sought judicial review of an FTC decision to deny Honickman interim distribution pending final agency action on his application 
vis-a-vis New York Seven-Up. This decision the Court held was reviewable agency action, and gave leave to add Count II to that 
extent. The Court subsequently denied plaintiffs' petition for injunctive relief with respect to the FTC's denial of interim 
distribution."
65,8, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). 
66,9," That the agency commissioners in these cases were not, strictly speaking, parties to the settlement agreements does not 
render the principle of deference inapplicable to the case at bar. As Judge Bork pointed out in his opinion for the court in 
National Fuel Gas Supply, an agency and its staff are not a monolith for all purposes, and even an agreement to which the staff 
is a party ""does not make the Commission itself an interested party to the settlement contract."" 811 F.2d at 1572. "
67,10," Plaintiffs further assert that, without the prior approval provision, the FTC might not otherwise have been entitled to notice of 
the proposed acquisition. Pls.' Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. at 49. This argument ignores the likely applicability of the 
Hart-Scott-Rodino (""HSR"") Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18a, with its premerger notification and waiting requirements, to Honickman's 
acquisition of Brooklyn Bottling. See 15 U.S.C. §§ 18a(a)(2)(A), 18a(b). Assuming that these provisions applied, it would make 
little sense for the FTC to bargain in a settlement agreement for things to which it was already entitled by Act of Congress. "
69,11," In contrast, these statutes do require the Commission to hold formal hearings when the FTC issues a complaint in the first 
instance. See 5 U.S.C.§§ 21(b), 41(b). "
70,12, Which he did. See AR 1479 et seq.
70,13," The specific passage on which plaintiffs rely reads as follows: While this Court has not attempted to define with exactness the liberty thus guaranteed, the term has received much 
consideration and some of the included things have been definitely stated. Without doubt, it denotes not merely freedom from 
bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire "
71,," useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own 
conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of 
happiness by free men. . . . Meyer, 262 U.S. at 399 (citations omitted). The right to contract, of course, was not itself at issue in Meyer. And while the 
Supreme Court continues to refer to the passage above for the general proposition that the liberty interests protected by the 
Constitution extend beyond mere freedom from bodily restraint, see, e.g., Roth, 408 U.S. at 572 (quoting the passage), the 
Meyer Court's inclusion of the right to contract as a liberty interest apparently rested on a line of cases, applying substantive due 
process analysis to contract rights, which the Court subsequently abandoned in Nebbia v. New York, 291 U.S. 502, 78 L. Ed. 
940, 54 S. Ct. 505 (1934), and West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379, 81 L. Ed. 703, 57 S. Ct. 578 (1937). See Meyer, 
262 U.S. at 399 (citing, e.g., Adkins v. Children's Hospital, 261 U.S. 525, 67 L. Ed. 785, 43 S. Ct. 394 (1923); Lochner v. New 
York, 198 U.S. 45, 49 L. Ed. 937, 25 S. Ct. 539 (1905); and Allgeyer v. Louisiana, 165 U.S. 578, 41 L. Ed. 832, 17 S. Ct. 427 
(1897)). Thus, the mere inclusion of the right to contract in Meyer's catalogue of liberty interests protected Constitution tells us 
nothing about the weight to be accorded that right against ""governmental regulation for the public welfare."" Nebbia, 291 U.S. at 
525. "
73,14," The critical role of local bottlers in the distribution and marketing of the products of national concentrate manufacturers is a 
feature of the carbonated soft drink industry and received extensive analysis by Judge Gesell in FTC v. Coca-Cola, 641 F. Supp. 
1128, 1134-1137 (D.D.C. 1986), vacated as moot, 829 F.2d 191 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Much of Judge Gesell's analysis, including his 
discussion of the position of small concentrate manufacturers, third bottlers, piggybacking and alternative channels of 
distribution, applies to the facts of this case. Compare id. with AR 1429-1438. "
74,15," These findings appear in an Order Approving Asset Sale And Granting Related Relief, In re Seven-Up Brooklyn Bottling 
Company, Case No. 090-71516-21 (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. May 2, 1991), signed by United States Bankruptcy Judge Cecelia H. Goetz, 
which appears at AR 551-566. "
75,16," The engagement letter between DPSU and Robert T. Shircliff and Associates was signed on January 17, 1991. AR 582. The 
draft asset purchase agreement was prepared on or about January 25, 1991. AR 95. That agreement was submitted to the 
bankruptcy court on January 28, 1991. AR 78. The letter to DPSU reporting the results of the Shircliff search was dated June 10, 
1991, several months after the bankruptcy court's order approving the sale of Brooklyn Bottling to Honickman. AR 574. "

94,3," Another incident was reported to the Commission in which an independent consultant putting together gas supply packages for 
sale on the market approached a pipeline regarding transportation of the gas. The pipeline, however, learning of the availability 
of the gas by virtue of the consultant's request for transportation, sent its marketing affiliate to the producer to make a 
counteroffer for the gas. Id. at 33,563. "
95,4," See, e.g., Supplemental Comments of Exxon Corp. (July 23, 1987) at 2-3; Comments of Eastern Kentucky Production Co. (July 
23, 1987) at 6."
95,5," See, e.g., Comments of Tenneco Inc. (Dec. 12, 1986) at 15-16; Comments of ANR Pipeline Co. and Colorado Interstate Gas 
Co. (July 24, 1987) at 11. In particular, the staff of the Federal Trade Commission noted that pipelines may be particularly 
efficient gas marketers because of their knowledge of and experience in all aspects of gas production. See Statement of the 
United States Federal Trade Commission Staff, supra, at 20-22."
95,6," See, e.g., Comments of SNG Trading, Inc. (Dec. 19, 1986) at 2. The pipeline petitioners argue that ""only marketing affiliates 
have any significant incentive to help[] the pipeline meet its purchase commitments under its long-term producer contracts."" Joint 
Brief for Pipeline Petitioners at 15. "
96,7," Specifically, the independent functioning standard provides that: HN7[
] To the maximum extent practicable [a pipeline's] operating employees and the operating employees of its marketing 
affiliate must function independently of each other."
96,18, C.F.R. § 161.3(g). 
97,8," Nor are we persuaded that the Commission has impermissibly overlooked the benefits marketing affiliates provide in relieving 
pipelines' take-or-pay liability. Based on its review of specific submissions on this issue, the Commission concluded that ""a 
pipeline can undertake take-or-pay negotiations even if the pipeline and its marketing affiliate do not share any personnel."" Order 
497 at 31,143. Petitioners do not challenge that statement. Their sole contention is that take-or-pay relief efforts can be 
""enhanced"" by the participation of a marketing affiliate who has knowledge of the pipeline's supply contracts and of the amount 
of take-or-pay relief obtained from the sale of gas under different contracts. Joint Brief for Pipeline Petitioners at 32. That 
argument, however, is simply a particularized version of the pipeline petitioners' basic claim that there are costs to the 
Commission's regulation. That take-or-pay negotiations will not be ""enhanced"" is one cost that the Commission could reasonably 
balance against the benefits to be derived from some level of separation between pipelines and their marketing affiliates."
97,9," In attempting to rebut this argument, the pipeline petitioners do not argue that the line drawing involved in the independent 
functioning standard is a flawed response to the problem of anticompetitive abuse stemming from the pipeline-affiliate 
relationship. Rather, the pipeline petitioners broadly challenge the basis for ordering any separation of pipelines and marketing 
affiliates. The pipeline petitioners assert that having regulated in favor of open access in Order 436 and imposed strict standards 
of conduct proscribing preferences in Orders 497 and 497-A, the Commission had no rational basis for imposing any structural 
remedy at all. Joint Reply Brief for Pipeline Petitioners at 8-9. We need not dwell long on this argument; it seems eminently reasonable for the Commission to conclude that the likelihood of 
affiliate favoritism and illicit passing of information between pipeline and affiliate would be reduced if their operating personnel 
functioned independently of each other. "

61,284, 61,904 (1991). "
100,11," Minnesota and Hadson Gas also object that the Commission's orders fail to define ""operating employees"" and ""independent 
functioning."" Even petitioners recognize, however, that ""the Commission is entitled to a certain leeway in promulgating a general 
standard that will be given more complete definition when it is applied on a case-by-case basis."" Joint Brief for Minnesota and 
Hadson Gas at 41. We think petitioners' challenge as to these two regulatory phrases falls within that concession. "

112,1," Calling rice-based or whole-grain solutions ""solutions"" is somewhat of a misnomer. As chemists use the term, ""solutions,"" such 
as Tang, are clear and do not separate out into their solid and liquid components. Rice-based solutions are actually 
""suspensions,"" which, like fresh-squeezed orange juice, must he mixed or shaken to evenly distribute the non-liquid component, 
and even then remain cloudy. "
113,2,"  Mead, pointing to an isolated dictum in Maxim's Ltd. v. Badonsky, 772 F.2d 388, 391 (7th Cir. 1985), states that if the balance of 
irreparable harms (factor number 3 in the text) tips toward the defendant, the preliminary injunction must be denied regardless of 
the strength of plaintiff's case on the merits. This statement is erroneous. HN3[
] It is the balance of harms discounted by the 
parties' relative chances of succeeding on the merits (and taking account of the public interest), not the undiscounted balance of 
harms, that must weigh in plaintiff's favor for a preliminary injunction to issue.  Id. at 392; see also Diginet, 958 F.2d at 1393; 
Ping v. National Educ. Ass'n, 870 F.2d 1369, 1371-72 (7th Cir. 1989); American Hosp. Supply, 780 F.2d at 598; Roland Mach., 
749 F.2d at 392 (""when there is no clear balance of hardships in favor of the injunction, [plaintiff] must show that it is more likely 
than not to win"" on the merits). To buttress its position, Mead also relies upon a passage in Diginet, 958 F.2d at 1394, which reads: ""Given the exceptionally 
one-sided balance of harms [in defendant's favor], it is plain that the injunction should not have been issued, regardless of the 
likely merits of the [plaintiff's] claim."" When read in context, however, this passage does not support Mead's position. We 
characterized the balance of harms as ""exceptionally one sided"" because the plaintiff in Diginet failed to demonstrate that it 
would suffer any irreparable harm in the event preliminary relief were denied; in fact, we found that the plaintiff would benefit 
from a denial. Id. As such, the plaintiff could not clear the second preliminary injunction threshold (factor number 2 in the text), 
and hence was doomed to lose regardless of its chances of succeeding on the merits. To illustrate our point, consider the following. Plaintiff X seeks a preliminary injunction against defendant Y. Suppose that the 
(undiscounted) balance of irreparable harms tips slightly toward Y--in other words, that X will be irreparably harmed 9x if the 
court denies preliminary relief, while Y will he harmed 10x if the court grants it. Suppose further that X has a 99 percent chance 
of succeeding on the merits, Y a one percent chance, and that the public interest is not implicated by the case. The proper 
course in this instance--recognizing, of course, that quantifying the factors to this degree of precision is likely impossible--would 
be to grant preliminary relief, for that is the course that would minimize the cost of error. Weighing the equities as a whole favors 
X, making preliminary relief appropriate, even though the undiscounted balance of harms favors Y. "
114,3," Both parties state that a plaintiff, to obtain a preliminary injunction, must show that the injunction would not harm the public 
interest. This, in effect, adds a third threshold to our preliminary injunction standard by making the public interest factor 
dispositive. Although the statement finds support from a dictum in Brunswick Corp. v. Jones, 784 F.2d 271, 274 n.1 (7th Cir. 
1986) (as a prerequisite, plaintiff must establish that ""an injunction would not harm the public interest""), we question whether it 
accurately characterizes the law of the circuit. HN4[
] The public interest is one factor courts must consider in weighing the 
equities; it is not dispositive.  Ping, 870 F.2d at 1371-72; American Hosp. Supply, 780 F.2d at 601-02. Suppose, to take a simple 
example, that the balance of harms tips significantly in plaintiff's favor, that plaintiff has an overwhelming chance of succeeding 
on the merits, but that granting the injunction would ever so slightly impair the public interest (e.g., by removing one of ten 
products from a given product market). In this instance, preliminary relief would be proper even though it might harm the public 
interest. "
117,4," In holding that Abbott did not demonstrate any injury to its reputation, the district court focused exclusively upon, and dismissed 
as ""hyperbole,"" Abbott's assertion that Mead's campaign had shaken Abbott's ""reputation for innovation."" Dist. Op. at 76-77. The 
court did not address the reputational harm that attends a charge of product inferiority. "
118,5," Mead argues that the district court did not have to consider the effects of more mild remedies because ""Abbott did not request 
any relief . . . less draconian"" than ordering Mead to recall Ricelyte, stop using the name ""Ricelyte,"" or change its label. This is 
simply not true. Abbott explicitly requested the district court to enjoin Mead from advancing false claims in its promotional 
materials, Pl.'s Compl. at 21-22 (Feb. 21, 1991), relief certainly less draconian than that mentioned by Mead. "
119,6,"  We emphasize that the relevant harms are only those that accrue between a court's ruling upon the preliminary injunction motion 
and the entry of final judgment, Roland Mach., 749 F.2d at 391, and even then only those harms that could not be fully rectified 
by money damages or injunctive relief at final judgment or, as to the defendant, could not be fully covered by a Rule 65(c) 
injunction bond. Id. at 386,387. Given its finding that Abbott failed to demonstrate any irreparable injury, the court technically did 
not have to balance the hardships; demonstrating irreparable injury is a threshold matter, the failure of which dooms a plaintiff's 
case and renders moot any further inquiry.  Lawson Prods., 782 F.2d at 1433. Nonetheless, a court under these circumstances 
is well advised to consider the irreparable harm that would attend a preliminary injunction, for it gives us something to work with 
if, as here, we rule that the plaintiff has cleared the irreparable harm threshold. "
122,7," As an alternative argument for affirmance, Mead argues that Abbott has not established the second element of its trade dress 
claim: that consumers would likely be confused by the resemblance of Ricelyte to Pedialyte. This argument is without merit. The 
bottles, as the district court observed, are ""virtually identical,"" see Appendix, and Abbott need not present compelling evidence of 
actual consumer confusion at the preliminary injunction stage.  Vaughan Mfg., 814 F.2d at 349. "
127,1," Plaintiffs assert that the agreement called for a transfer of the notes only after final payment had been received, that 
McNamara's consideration was not received until at least February 13, and that the notes were not transferred until on or after 
February 18. The agreement itself, however, plainly states that as of February 6, 1987, First Bank ""has assigned"" its interest in 
the notes and collateral to Fletcher and McNamara, who are expressly permitted to use the collateral, including patents. The "
128,," agreement also provides that should Fletcher and McNamara sell or transfer the patents, the proceeds would be divided with 
75% going to First Bank and 25% to Fletcher and McNamara. Plaintiffs submitted a letter from First Bank to Fletcher and McNamara, dated February 18, 1987, stating that the notes are 
enclosed. They make a great deal of the apparent delay in the physical transfer of the notes, but it is clear from the February 6 
agreement that the conveyance of First Bank's interests took place on that date. "
145,1," It is undisputed that Joseph and Mildred Fontenot owned 100 percent of all of the defendant corporations and are the sole 
shareholders and directors, with the exception of SES/Georgia, of which they owned 51 percent. However, Joseph Fontenot 
served as president of that corporation as well. "
146,2," Plaintiffs and General Instruments filed for partial summary judgment against SESE on February 13, 1991, and against the 
other defendants on March 26, 1991. This matter was transferred to this Court on December 11, 1992. As will be noted below, 
discovery has been available during the entire pendency of these motions."
146,3," Jurisdiction is founded upon diversity of citizenship, and state law governs plaintiffs' suit on open account. "
147,4," HN1[
] Suits on open account are governed by La. R.S. 9:2781. The plaintiff must prove, by a preponderance of evidence, 
that one or more sales were made to defendant, that written demand was made, and that no payment was made within 15 days 
after receipt of written demand. If the correct amount was demanded, attorneys fees are also available. See, Chachere v. Bren 
Lynn Corp., 561 So.2d 140 (La. App. 1990). "
148,5," Plaintiffs, however, do not allege fraud. "
149,6," SES/Louisiana argues that because not ""every employee of SES/East was hired, this factor is not important. However, 
SES/Louisiana does not contend that the employees not hired were retained by SES/East, but simply that they were laid off. The 
Court finds this a distinction without a difference."
149,7," Wolff suggests that there mere fact that both corporations have the same shareholders is sufficient to permit plaintiffs to collect 
their debt from the new corporation, but the Court need not rely on this in order to grant summary judgment. "
151,8," Plaintiffs also contend that these suits are invalid because they were not cases in controversy, since the same person was 
owner and president of all of the parties. This argument is attractive, but this Court need not reach it. "
152,9," The suit against Jo'Mil was in Louisiana district court, and there is presumably no bar to plaintiffs' revocatory action in that 
matter."
152,10," The Court notes the issue, but does not decide, whether the second-line stores who did not contract directly with GI may raise 
a breach of contract issue, either because they were in privity with SES/East or because the contract was a stipulation pour 
autri. Neither party has raised this issue. "
155,11, The Court intimates no opinion as to the ultimate accuracy of these allegations by this recitation. 
156,12," The Sylvania court left open the possibility that some vertical restrains may justify per-se condemnation. The effect of vertical 
restraints on intrabrand competition when there is little or no interbrand competition, may, under a proper showing, warrant such 
condemnation. See, Sylvania, supra, at 52, n.19. However, this issue is not now before us because no evidence regarding the 
amount of either intra- or interbrand competition, or the effect of these restraints on such competition, has been submitted. Nor 
have any such facts been pled."
156,13," HN14[
] The standard for summary judgment is identical to the standard for a directed verdict. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317 (1986)."
156,14," Both the distributor and the GI employee referred to in the notation deny knowledge of any such notations, but this is a matter 
of credibility which is the province of the jury."
156,15," Although it is doubtful that hearsay is permissible in an affidavit unless the opposing party can prove the underlying facts at 
trial, compare, Lavespere v. Niagra Mach. & Tool Works, 910 F.2d 167 (5th Cir. 1990) with Geiserman v. MacDonald, 893 F.2d 
787 (5th Cir. 1990), the Court believes these affidavits are not pivotal because of the fatal flaw in SESE's pleadings and proof as 
to the relevant markets and antitrust injury. "
157,16," Even if this Court were to presume that the relevant product market is the patented device of GI, over which it holds a legal 
monopoly, SESE has failed to allege either the relevant geographic market or the level of competition which was affected by GI's 
concerted refusal to deal."
157,17," Illegal tying may also be a violation of the Clayton Act, but the analysis as to the dispositive issue is the same for both. See, 
Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 10, n. 15. "
158,18," Payne dealt with a § 2(a) case, but the antitrust injury requirement has been held applicable to § 2(d) and (e) cases, as well. 
See, World of Sleep, Inc. v. La-Z-Boy Chair Co., 756 F.2d 1467 (10th Cir. 1985) and Rutman Wine Co. v. E. & J. Gallo Winery, 
829 F.2d 729 (9th Cir. 1987). "
159,19," The factual support for SESE's allegations were filed as part of a joint opposition of all counter-claimants, and have also been 
considered in favor the stores in this opposition. Therefore, the factual deficiencies already discussed apply equally here. "
160,20," In light of this holding, the Court need not and does not reach the issue of whether the stores' claims are forbidden as 
constituting a ""pass-on"" theory under Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720 (1977)."
160,21," Among plaintiffs' assertions is that the Fontenots have drained all of the stores of their assets. In light of this contention, the 
Court must wonder of the efficacy of solidary liability against these stores. However, the stratagems of the parties is not now a 
concern of the Court."
160,22," Despite numerous briefs and reply briefs on their behalf on this issue, the stores do not contend that Louisiana law is 
inapplicable as against them, although they are all of foreign domicile. Therefore, the Court will use Louisiana law under the 
presumption that there is no difference between it and any foreign law which might be applied. "
161,23," This is not to suggest that a party can avoid summary by talismanic use of the words ""fraud"" or ""bad faith"". In addition to the 
allegations, there must be evidence with creates an issue of fact as to that allegation. This Court simply finds that summary 
judgment is not available as this record is now constituted."
161,24," To rule otherwise would suggest that single person could never own and run two or more closely-held corporations and enjoy 
the protections afforded under the law."
161,25," SES/Mississippi contends summary judgment is appropriate because it did not come into existence until after plaintiffs ceased 
doing business with SES/East. But in light of this Court's ruling that SES/Louisiana is the successor corporation to 
SES/Louisiana, this fact is not dispositive. "
171,1," HN1[
] Section one of the Sherman Act provides: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several 
States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."
171,15," U.S.C. § 1. Plaintiff bases its right to sue on the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 15 and 26. HN2[
] Section 15 establishes the right of private parties to bring suit and recover treble damages: (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reasons of 
anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the United States . . . without respect to the 
amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable 
attorney's fee."
171,15," U.S.C. § 15. HN3[
] Section 26 establishes the right to injunctive relief; it provides: Any person, firm or corporation . . . shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of the United States having 
jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by violation of the antitrust laws . . . when and under the same 
conditions and principles as injunctive relief against threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage is granted by courts of 
equity, under the rules governing such proceedings . . . . "

172,2," The class, as certified, consists of: All individuals, persons, proprietorships, partnerships, corporations and other entities (excluding defendants, their subsidiaries, 
their affiliates and co-conspirators) who were accounts of defendants and sold raw material directly to any defendant in the 
geographic area from at least as early as January 1, 1977, to at least December 31, 1984. The ""geographic area"" covered by the class consists of parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Connecticut. In addition to the sellers included in the class, renders also purchase raw materials from: (1) ""peddlers"" or brokers in the 
business of purchasing byproducts from others and reselling them to renderers; and (2) occasionally, from other renderers. 
Renderers do not routinely use other rendering companies as a supply source. They typically purchase from other renderers 
only when, due to some difficulty or unusual circumstance, the other renderer has an excess supply which it is unable to process 
in a timely fashion. Members of these other groups are not parties to this action. Only sellers who generate raw materials are 
members of the plaintiff class."
172,3, Ryder Rendering sold its assets to Darling in 1984.

175,8," Theater Enterprises, Inc. v. Paramount Film Distributing Corp., 346 U.S. 537 (1954). "
176,9," The Ninth Circuit has, in its analysis of Matsushita and Monsanto, added another consideration: whether ""permitting an 
inference of conspiracy would pose a significant deterrent to beneficial procompetitive behavior."" In re Coordinated Pretrial 
Proceedings, 906 F.2d 432, 440 (9th Cir. 1990). In the same opinion, the court commented extensively on the ground-breaking shifting of analysis to the court on summary 
judgment motions and the care which must be taken not to read too much into the Supreme Court's language, stating that the 
Court's opinions should not be interpreted as suggesting that a district court may grant summary judgment to antitrust defendants whenever the court concludes that 
inferences of conspiracy and inferences of innocent conduct are equally plausible. Allowing the district court to make that 
decision would lead to a dramatic judicial encroachment on the province of the jury. To read Matsushita as requiring judges to 
ask whether the circumstantial evidence is more 'consistent' with the defendants' theory than with the plaintiff's theory would 
imply that the jury should be permitted to choose an inference of conspiracy only if the judge has first decided that he would 
himself draw that inference. This approach would essentially convert the judge into a thirteenth juror, who must be persuaded 
before an antitrust violation may be found. . . . . Nor do we think that Matsushita and Monsanto can be read as authorizing a court to award summary judgment to antitrust 
defendants whenever the evidence is plausibly consistent with both inferences of conspiracy and inferences of innocent conduct. 
Such an approach would imply that circumstantial evidence alone would rarely be sufficient to withstand summary judgment in 
an antitrust case. After all, circumstantial evidence is nearly always evidence that is plausibly consistent with competing 
inferences . . . . (Citation omitted.) . . . . . . . . The key to proper interpretation of Matsushita lies in the Court's emphasis on the dangers of permitting inferences from 
certain types of ambiguous evidence. . . . . Thus, Matsushita established that a trial judge should not permit an inference of antitrust conspiracy from circumstantial 
evidence where to do so would have the effect of deterring significant procompetitive conduct . . . . In short, the trial court must 
consider whether, on the evidence presented, the protection of innocent independent conduct outweighs the costs associated 
with the potential decrease in strict antitrust enforcement. If it does, then the plaintiff must come forward with additional, 
'sufficiently unambiguous' evidence that does not have these undesirable deterrent effects. Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings, supra, 906 F.2d at 438-39. "
180,10," Ebersole began working for Moyer following the sale of his rendering business to Moyer. Following the expiration of his non-
compete agreement with Moyer (signed in connection with the sale of his business), he left Moyer, formed his own rendering 
company, and again became a competitor of Moyer."

time. He sat in our house, we discussed it in detail on a daily, regular basis. (M. Ellerin deposition, p. 45, excerpts reproduced at plaintiff's joint appendix, Vol. I, exhibit 7) Both Lee and Kent Ryder discussed business matters with her and confided to her that they believed other renderers were

States v. Standard Tallow Corp., 85 Civ. 2062 (S.D.N.Y. March 15, 1985)."
188,17," None of the present defendants was named a defendant in Baugh, supra, although the roster of defendants included the Van 
Iderstine Company (later acquired by Darling) and Robert C. Sage, who served as Standard's chief raw material solicitor from 
1970 to 1987. Each entered a plea of nolo contendere. (The court cannot at this time identify the source of this information.) The Grand Jury returned its indictment September 17, 1952, charging, inter alia, ""beginning in or about 1935 . . . up to and 
including the date of the return"" of the indictment, that the defendants had conspired, inter alia, to: (1) fix prices for the purchase of rendering material from suppliers in the Philadelphia area; (2) fix opening prices, cash bonuses, and other gratuities to be paid or given the owner of a new stop in the Philadelphia area; (3) refrain from soliciting ""stops from which another defendant renderer purchases rendering material in the Philadelphia area""; (4) engage in the following conduct: ""when one defendant renderer purchases rendering material from a supplier of another 
defendant renderer in the Philadelphia area the defendant renderer receiving the rendering material of said supplier will permit 
the defendant renderer losing the business of said supplier to secure an equivalent amount of business from one of his 
suppliers""; and (5) ""prevent in the Philadelphia area any person, firm or corporation from entering the rendering business or from becoming a 
peddler, to force renderers other than defendants out of the rendering business and to force peddlers to give up the collection of 
rendering material . . . (Plaintiff's joint appendix, Vol. I, exhibit 3, Grand Jury Indictment, paras. 27-28)"
188,18," Harrigan was the civil corollary, filed by a competing renderer, to the 1952 criminal indictment, Baugh. The roster of 
defendants included Van Iderstine and Sage. (Plaintiff's joint appendix, Vol. I, exhibit 4, complaint) Harrigan terminated in an out-
of-court settlement for an undisclosed amount."
188,19," Darling-Delaware and Standard Tallow were both named defendants in United States v. Darling Delaware, Inc., No. 70 CR 
1078 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 17, 1970). Both were indicted by a grand jury on charges of violating Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 
U.S.C. § 1, by, inter alia: (1) refraining from soliciting or accepting business from accounts of other renderers; (2) submitting collusive and rigged bids to certain accounts; and (3) resolving ""allocation disputes where an account changed from one defendant or co-conspirator renderer to another, by 
requiring the latter renderer to return the account or by allowing the account's retention but requiring that an account of 
approximately equal tonnage be exchanged for the account lost"". (Plaintiff's joint appendix, Vol. I, exhibit 2, Grand Jury Indictment, para. 16) These activities were alleged to have occurred over a 
period ""beginning at least as early as 1931, the exact date being unknown"" and continuing to the date the grand jury indictment 
was returned (December 17, 1970). (Plaintiff's joint appendix, Vol. I, exhibit 2, Grand Jury Indictment, para. 14) "

settlement."
189,21," In United States v. Standard Tallow Corp., 85 Civ. 2062 (S.D.N.Y. March 15, 1985) the federal government alleged that 
""beginning sometime in November 1975 and continuing thereafter until at least April 1982"" Standard Tallow violated the False

consideration in compromising or attempting to compromise a claim which was disputed as to either validity or amount, is not 
admissible to prove liability for or invalidity of the claim or its amount. Evidence of conduct or statements made in compromise 
negotiations is likewise not admissible. This rule does not require the exclusion of any evidence otherwise discoverable merely 
because it is presented in the course of compromise negotiations. This rule also does not require exclusion when the evidence is 
offered for another purpose, such as proving bias or prejudice of a witness, negativing a contention of undue delay, or proving 
an effort to obstruct a criminal investigation or prosecution."

206,2," In this appeal, Reserve does not challenge the district court's finding of no illegal price discrimination by either CertainTeed or 
Owens-Corning in sales to customers other than BMA. Appellant's Br. at 11 n.1. "
208,3," See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322 (""In our view, the plain language of Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment . . . 
against a [nonmoving] party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that 
party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial."") (emphasis supplied). "
209,4," Earl W. Kintner, A Robinson-Patman Primer 187 (1970)."
209,5," The district court described the use of a ""Special Approval Request"" form in the following way: Owens-Corning's regular practice required its sales representatives to complete ""Special Approval Requests"" (""SARs"") when 
deciding whether to partially or wholly meet a reported competitive offer. SAR's document information about the identities of 
customers and competitors, competitive prices reported by a customer, and prices requested for approval by Owens-Corning 
sales representatives. If a sales representative recommended meeting a price, the representative forwarded a completed SAR to 
Owens-Corning's Toledo headquarters, where RIDMD [Owens-Corning's Residential Insulation Distribution Marketing Division] 
personnel could assess the reported competitive offer's credibility. If necessary, RIDMD sought further information from a 
customer. . . . Furthermore, Owens-Corning periodically reverified that competitors continued to offer the prices that Owens-
Corning had elected to meet. Reserve Supply Corp. v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 1991-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) P 69,304 at 65,141 (N.D. Ill. 1990). These 
SARs were retained in Owens-Corning's files. "
210,6," Also, Reserve states in its Local Rule 12(f) statement that Lee told Owens-Corning salesperson Dexter Goodwin in April 1979 
that CertainTeed was offering a 16 percent discount to BMA. R.158 at P 17. "
211,7," Reserve also states that BMA explicitly told Owens-Corning that it would keep its purchases from CertainTeed to a minimum. 
R.158, Lee Dep. Ex. 6. Consequently, Reserve argues, BMA's business was secure at Owens-Corning, and it had no reason to 
drop its discount to meet a possible threat from CertainTeed. This statement hardly creates a genuine issue of triable fact. As a 
preliminary matter, it is contrary to Reserve's admissions that (1) purchasers actively disclosed discounts to their suppliers in 
order to acquire better prices and (2) that Owens-Corning could not maintain a higher price than Johns-Manville or CertainTeed 
without a loss of business. More importantly, this statement purportedly assuring Owens-Corning was made at the exact time 
that Owens-Corning agreed to offer the 16 percent discount, in June 1979, after it had already instituted the 15 percent discount. 
It therefore has little probative value. "

can successfully sell at a higher price than its competitors; and if a seller attempts to sell at a lower price . . . its competitors will 
be given the opportunity to meet its lower price, thereby resulting in uniform prices again, but at a lower level; and without any

227,1," As a formal matter, the only issue before me today is whether to dismiss claims against APS. The present motion-- captioned 
""Motion to Dismiss Counterclaim of Defendant Hi-Tech Systems, Inc. Against Plaintiff Advanced Power Systems, Inc.""-- simply 
incorporates an earlier motion to dismiss that addressed the first amended counterclaim against APS alone. As such, this motion 
does not deal with claims against the subsequently added principals of APS. However, the threshold sufficiency of the claims 
against the APS principals was briefed by both parties in the context of defendant's petition to file an amended counterclaim 
against the principals. Moreover, the claims against APS and its principals raise substantially similar, if not identical, issues. For 
these reasons, I regard the previously stated objections to Hi-Tech's claims against the APS principals as having been 
incorporated in the instant motion to dismiss. "
229,2," The statute of limitations is tolled as soon as a motion for leave to file an amended complaint is filed, rather than on the date of 
final approval of that motion. See Longo v. Pennsylvania Elec. Co., 618 F. Supp. 87, 89 (D.C.Pa. 1985)."
229,3," Because I decide that the amended counterclaim relates back to the original pleading, I need not determine whether the 
second amended counterclaim, filed within the statutory period, itself tolled the statute of limitations, despite being improperly 
filed. There is, however, a strong argument that it did. State law supplies the rule of decision for determining when an action is 
commenced for purposes of the state's statute of limitations. Walker v. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U.S. 740, 752-53, 64 L. Ed. 2d 
659, 100 S. Ct. 1978 (1980). Under Pennsylvania law, an action may be commenced by filing a complaint, Pa. R. Civ. P. 1007 
(2), which here was done within the statutory period. While the filing process was defective, the Pennsylvania courts have 
repeatedly emphasized that once a complaint is filed, the central concern is not procedural propriety but the good faith of the 
plaintiff and the notice received by the defendant. For this reason, the Third Circuit has described Pennsylvania rules for 
commencement of an action as ""relatively liberal."" Patterson v. American Bosch Corp., 914 F.2d 384, 387 (3d Cir. 1990). For 
instance, timely filing of a complaint may be sufficient to toll the running of the statute of limitations even in the absence of proper 
service within the statutory period. See, e.g., Lamp v. Heyman, 469 Pa. 465, 366 A.2d 882 (Pa. 1976) (finding that filing of a 
praecipe four days before expiration of two year statute of limitations tolled the statute, where plaintiff failed to deliver the writ to 
the sheriff for service). Instead of treating defects in process as inevitably fatal, Pennsylvania requires plaintiffs who have 
initiated an action to make ""a good faith effort to effectuate notice of the action."" Farinacci v. Beaver County Industrial 
Development Authority, 510 Pa. 589, 511 A.2d 757, 759 (Pa. 1986). Under this ""good faith"" effort rule, ""the thrust of all inquiry is 
one of whether a plaintiff engaged in a 'course of conduct' forestalling the legal machinery put in motion by his/her filings."" 
Leidich v. Franklin, 394 Pa. Super. 302, 575 A.2d 914, 918 (Pa. Super. 1990) (citing Lamp). Here, there is simply no evidence 
of such a course of conduct or any bad faith whatsoever on defendant's part. After the second amended counterclaim was found 
defective, defendant quickly filed for leave to file a new counterclaim. Moreover, plaintiffs were put on notice within the statutory period of the commencement of an action against them, as evidenced 
by their motion to strike of March 8, 1991. Under Pennsylvania law, the statute of limitations is tolled when plaintiff timely files a 
complaint and defendant is timely put on notice of the action, even when the process though which defendant received notice 
was technically improper. See Leidich, 575 A.2d at 918 (plaintiff's improper service of summons on defendants by mail was 
sufficient to toll statute of limitations)."
229,4," Even when dealing with a state law claim, the question whether an amendment relates back is one of federal law. See Britt v. 
Arvanitis, 590 F.2d 57, 60-61 (3d Cir. 1978); Loudenslager v. Teeple, 466 F.2d 249, 250 (3d Cir. 1972)."

256,6," BMW NA's response at appellate oral argument to the apparent inconsistency between Cronin's outrage in 1981 at the alleged 
bribe and his solicitation of Robert's application in 1982 is two-fold: (1) Robert's recollection of the 1982 date is inaccurate, or (2) 
Cronin had no responsibility for the Philadelphia territory. The first explanation clearly raises an issue of credibility for the jury. 
The second explanation is not borne out by the record. Prior to 1985, when the Mid-Atlantic Region was first formed, Cronin 
served the Eastern Region which encompassed Philadelphia. See A1853. Moreover, Green's testimony shows that Cronin 
supervised his dealership. See A1769."
256,7," Gladys Caufield testified that she believed that she and her lawyer, Marvin Buchner, negotiated with all three of the Potamkins, 
A1663, because she met with all three at one time. Moreover, Buchner initially contacted one of Victor's salesmen to inquire into 
the Potamkins' interest in Trans-Atlantic. A1621. "
257,8," BMW NA ultimately paid $ 693,569 for Trans-Atlantic, inclusive of parts. A1649. "
258,9," There is significant dispute concerning whether BMW NA made a good faith attempt to consider Robert's application. 
According to Robert's affidavit, by October 10th Green hand-delivered the buy-sell agreement to Philip Capossela, then the 
BMW Regional Manager for the mid-Atlantic Region, and requested a dealership application form which Capossela refused to 
provide. A1706. Capossela testified that he was thus aware of the expiration date, A103, and that at that time he told Green that 
Robert was not a ""suitable"" candidate for a franchise, in the words of BMW NA in-house counsel. A105-106. Robert telephoned 
Capossela and offered personally to travel to his Virginia office to obtain an application, but was told that the district manager 
would provide Robert with a copy and that he, Capossela, would contact Robert by October 16th. A1706-07. Robert was unable 
to reach Capossela again, but sent a letter, dated October 18th, A1716, and contacted Robert Casella, BMW Director of Dealer 
Development for the mid-Atlantic Region, on October 22, 1985, who again discouraged Robert from traveling to Virginia to 
obtain an application form. A1707. Casella agreed to meet with Robert on October 29th and to supply a form at that time. Robert 
then wrote a follow-up letter, A1717; Casella refutes Robert's recordation that Casella gave him assurances that there would be 
sufficient time to process the application before the expiration of the buy-sell agreement. A147; see also A1205-06 (Casella's 
""Inter-branch Memo"" of the incident). BMW NA provides a host of reasons for failing to decide on the application until after the agreement expired. It hints that * * * 
[clause deleted], and that field personnel could not have taken the application before October 29th and 30th. BMW NA also suggests that Irv 
Green did not properly tender notice of the alleged buy-sell agreement. Thus, Capossela testified that Green needed to enclose 
a cover letter to introduce the buy-sell agreement, and his personal delivery of the buy-sell agreement to BMW NA was 
insufficient notice. A1756. Indeed Jackling asserted that Robert's application was incomplete, and the buy-sell agreement expired of its own accord. 
A2415-16. The record does not indicate why, if the application package was incomplete, Jackling directed counsel at Weil, 
Gotshal to hire a private investigator to investigate Robert pursuant to the application, nor why other processing steps were 
taken. * * * [one sentence deleted] And Casella explained that an application is pending from the ""time the [acquisition agreement] hits my desk."" A1814. Although District Parts Manager Graynor indicated that Robert and his proposed parts manager had refused to sign the 
Prospective Dealer Parts Department form, A2017, Robert contends they were never shown that form. A1974. Another BMW 
dealer, Martin Sussman, had refused to sign a BMW Dealer Operating Requirement Agreement because he disagreed with one 
of its conditions, but had not been threatened with termination of his franchise. A2141-44."
258,10," In relevant part, Jackling wrote: "
259,," I am informed that Pennsylvania law allows BMWNA to respond to a request for consent to the sale of a franchise ""within 
60 days of receipt of a written request on the forms, if any, generally utilized by the manufacturer or distributor for such 
purposes and containing the information required."" At your October 10, 1985 meeting with Mr. Capossela, BMWNA was not provided with a written request or with the 
information we require in order to evaluate your potential purchaser. Mr. Potamkin submitted his application package on 
October 29. The following day, October 30, we received your written request for consent. By statute, BMWNA's 60 days to evaluate the proposed sale of a franchise cannot expire on a Saturday or Sunday. 
Consequently, whether we count from October 29 or from October 30, BMWNA's deadline is Monday, December 30, 1985. "

261,18," . evidence that BMW NA punished discounters by decreasing their allocations; and last,"
261,19, . BMW NA's aversion to the Potamkins. 
262,12," A November, 1985 memorandum from Robert Casella, Business Development Manager for the Mid-Atlantic Region, to 
Edward Robinson, BMW NA's Eastern Region Sales Manager, best articulates BMW NA's position:"
262,1," . Mr. Potamkin has not indicated a willingness to provide the necessary minimum operating requirements standards for 
Service and Parts."
262,2," . It is not clear that proposed Potamkin BMW would be a distinct and separate operation allowing for the complete 
autonomy needed for a proficient and distinct BMW operation."
262,3," . Mr. Potamkin has expressed an unwillingness to provide the necessary exclusive personnel required for the BMW 
operation."
262,4," . As a dealer in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and through his association and vested interest in the Potamkin New York 
organization, Robert M. Potamkin brings a somewhat cloudy commitment to customer satisfaction and customer service, in 
addition, to publicly announced pending legal action for odometer tampering, advertising misrepresentation, and 
questionable leasing tactics. The above as evidenced by enclosed newspaper articles."
262,5," . Mr. Potamkin has emphatically stressed that the guide of 94 units would not be acceptable. It is felt that at some time in 
the future our status at the proposed facility would be compromised and the BMW operation would be shuffled into 
secondary or less than adequate accommodations. A1901. In addition, many of those same reasons were provided to Green by Andrew Pokorny: . . . Moreover, to date, Mr. Potamkin has been unwilling to agree to meet BMWNA's minimum standard operating 
requirements, and to accept an SPG of 94 units -- the identical SPG you have. We are unwilling to accept any buyer not 
prepared to meet our minimum operating standards. In addition, Potamkin's action reflects a spirit of non-cooperation which 
is contrary to that required to build a good working relationship. . . . A869-70. "
263,13," Proof of anticompetitive effect is the hallmark of a rule of reason test, see Tunis Bros. Co., Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 952 F.2d 
715, (3d Cir. 1991) cert. denied, 120 L.Ed.2d 903, 60 U.S.L.W. 3879, 112 S.Ct. 3034 (June 30, 1992), and it is well settled that 
protecting interbrand, rather than intrabrand, competition should be the goal of antitrust law.  GTE Sylvania, 433 U.S. at 52. "
264,14," In a letter to BMW dealer Irv Green, Andrew Porkorny, BMW NA's Vice President of Regional Operations and Sales, also 
provided as a reason for the decision that ""Mr. Potamkin is not qualified,"" the following: In general, it is clear to us that there is a fundamental incompatibility between the ""BMWNA"" corporate image and the 
""Potamkin"" image, that the proposed buyer will not maintain the high commitment to customer service required by BMWNA, 
and that Mr. Potamkin will not properly represent BMWNA in the market place. As a result, the public and BMWNA will be 
harmed should your proposed transaction go forward. A869. In an effort to prove that incompatibility, BMW NA has also produced the report of a private investigator, Earle Gay, which 
was prepared at the request of BMW NA's counsel during the pendency of Robert's application for the Green franchise. The 
Potamkins have provided sufficient evidence to render as a material factual dispute the genuineness of this ""image"" reason, 
however, especially as it relates to Gay's report. First, combined with the other evidence to indicate that BMW NA never intended to consider Robert's application, there is no 
dispute that Robert's application was the first for which BMW NA hired a private investigator's services. A2288. Gay submitted 
his report directly to the Weil, Gotshal & Manges law firm and BMW NA decision-makers never received a copy of it. A2164. 
Further, from the information provided to Gay at the outset of his investigation a jury could infer that BMW NA was culling 
pretextual excuses to deny a Potamkin franchise. Gay testified that he was ordered to investigate consumer complaints, but not 
provided with favorable references furnished by Robert. A2292-98. Despite BMW NA's contention that applicant references are 
always favorable and therefore were considered less valuable for purposes of its investigation, Gay testified that in each 
subsequent investigation of a potential dealer, BMW NA furnished him with a copy of the application and he checked positive as 
well as negative sources. Moreover, BMW NA's thorough investigation into the Potamkins' business practices appears pretextual given its lack of interest 
in similarly investigating other prospective and existing dealers. For example, although Gay was asked to investigate all 
consumer complaints against the Potamkins, a 1981 lawsuit brought by the Pennsylvania Attorney General against several 
Toyota dealerships, who also owned BMW franchises, attracted no attention from BMW NA. One BMW dealer who entered into 
an ""assurance of voluntary compliance"" with the state Attorney General's Office testified that he did not receive an inquiry from 
BMW NA. A2040-41."
264,15," Another reason given by BMW NA pertained to alleged deficiencies in Robert's Philadelphia location. We note that these are 
no more extensive than those attributed to other prospective and existing dealers, and a reasonable jury may find that rationale 
for BMW NA's decision to have been pretextual. For example, one BMW dealer, John Thompson, whose franchise acquisition 
was conditioned upon relocation, received numerous extensions over several years. A2034-40. By contrast, BMW NA contends 
that the location of Robert's proposed facility was undesirable, as had been Green's location, and that BMW NA had planned to 
move that dealership point north into the more affluent suburban area where Sloane BMW was eventually opened. Yet, in 
contrast to the negotiations with and repeated extensions given to Thompson, BMW NA never informed Robert of this alleged 
deficiency. Robert also opined that his proposed facility, located at a busy crossroads frequented by residents of the northern 
suburbs, would have been an appropriate one. Another dealer, Frank Ursomarso, conceded that he failed to meet a requirement of separate franchise facilities but has reached 
a compromise with BMW NA. A2465. For example, in response to one deficiency of which Robert was informed, lack of a 
customer service counter, he promised to build one to suit BMW NA. In contrast, BMW NA's District Parts Manager John 
Graynor indicated to Robert and his parts manager that BMW required an exclusive BMW parts manager and counted their 
disagreement as a deficiency; yet Robert was never informed that many BMW dealerships satisfied that requirement by 
assigning one assistant parts manager exclusively to the BMW franchise. A1916-18. "
265,16," Although BMW NA rejected BMW dealer Robert Ciasulli's initial application for a franchise in a 1981 proposed buy-sell 
agreement, citing a ""perceived lack of commitment to customer satisfaction,"" A2214, and again in 1986, citing concerns nearly 
identical to those invoked when rejecting Robert's application, A2229-30, the record indicates that Ciasulli subsequently received 
the Mack BMW franchise in Toms River, New Jersey. A2377; 2307-08. "
267,17," The parties have not addressed the question of choice of law. It remains true that if New York law governs the Trans-Atlantic 
incident (prospective contractual advantage) and Pennsylvania law governs the Green agreement (contractual relationship), 
then the Restatement (Second) of Torts, as adopted by each jurisdiction, would apply. We will proceed on that assumption. We note, however, that if Pennsylvania law were to control the prospective contractual advantage claim, proper recourse should 
be made to section 766 of the Restatement (First) of Torts.  Silver v. Mendel, 894 F.2d 598, 601-02 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 496

271,19, The Potamkins had been long recognized for selling high volumes of automobiles at discount prices. 
272,20," The affidavit suggests that some dealers had complained to Cronin prior to the meeting and that others complained following 
the meeting. There is nothing to suggest a meeting of the minds followed by concerted action."

274,24," In addition, I note that, while the majority opinion focuses on the dealer interactions with BMW NA, it overlooks the paucity of

274,25," A review of the depositions and exhibits makes clear that both BMW and its dealers had reason to fear a price cutting 
Potamkin franchise. The Potamkins had built a huge retail business by selling cars in high volume at small markup over the

service is provided though an interexchange carrier such as AT&T, which has a multi-LATA national network connected to 
virtually every local telephone company."
291,2," According to plaintiff, ""LATA"" stands for Local Access Transport Area,"" which is a geographic area in which Michigan Bell 
provides local and long distance service. Complaint P 6(s). The geographic region covered by a LATA is similar to that of an

304,2," The term ""bypass"" refers to the construction of a pipeline to connect an industrial customer directly to an interstate pipeline 
without using the facilities of the industrial customer's LDC. Major Deposition at 160."
304,3," ""Take or pay"" provisions in long term gas supply contracts require Southern to pay for gas covered by the contract, whether or 
not it takes the gas. In 1988, Southern and its LDC customers reached a settlement which permitted Southern to pass a portion 
of these take or pay costs to customers. This settlement, which was approved by the FERC, contained a term which would 
permit an LDC such as Alagasco to reduce its share of the take or pay costs in proportion to the amount of any load which the 
LDC lost to the pipeline in the event of a bypass. Matthews Deposition at 97. "
305,4," It was apparently this argument that led to plaintiff's motion for this judge to disqualify himself. The court denied the motion 
because, regardless of who makes the argument, the potential for some effect on this judge's family's interest is remote. (As a 
matter of interest, Grace Petroleum has already closed its well). Plaintiff's argument has a horseshoe nail and kingdom type 
theory which was rejected, in another context, in Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corp., 112 S. Ct. 1311, 60 U.S.L.W. 
4225, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532 (March 14, 1992) (Scalia, J., concurring)."
305,5," Mr. Limbaugh's deposition indicated that the possibility of incremental business was one factor which Southern considered in 
determining whether to grant the use of a tap."
305,6," Tutcher wrote to D. Mark Limbaugh, a Southern employee, on December 6, 1989. He stated that he was summarizing 
Southern's refusal to construct a new delivery point for GUA. The first rationale was the possibility of an economic benefit for 
Southern. Exhibit 103 to Tutcher's Deposition. While Mr. Limbaugh indicated in his deposition that the potential for increased 
volume was a consideration used by the company in determining whether to grant a tap, none of the materials furnished by GUA 
to the court contain a statement to the effect that Southern denied GUA a tap to service industrial end users because such 
service would not provide Southern with the possibility of transporting increased volume."
305,7," While Tuscaloosa Steel was a customer of Alagasco, the gas was transported to the mill through the Coronado line shipped 
through Alagasco's line. Southern had never transported this gas to through its line."
305,8," William Major, general counsel for Southern, William Matthews, the company's president, and Ron Gardner, allegedly adopted 
this policy."
305,9," In its brief, GUA maintains that Major's version of the policy differs from that propounded by Matthews and Gardner. Plaintiff's 
brief at 19. GUA claims that Major had testified that Southern would not grant a bypass unless there was incremental volume "
306,," from the direct connection. However, after reviewing Major's deposition, the court concludes that three gentleman presented the 
same version of the policy."
306,10, GUA provides no evidence of this.
306,11," GUA asserts that these actions are indicative of an agreement between Southern and Alagasco. This theory will be discussed 
more fully, infra."

Commission is informed."
306,14," Alagasco claimed that it has also reduced its transportation rates to certain industrial customers based upon a fear of 
competition from Southern. Memorandum at 15."
306,15," One of GUA's prospective ""end users"". "
307,16, GUA claims that Alagasco had access to this information because its computer is linked with Southern's.
307,17," In his affidavit, Tutcher refers to exhibits of these proformas and projections. None have been filed or submitted to the court."
307,18, Tutcher and Levrier's depositions provided this information regarding GUA. 
308,19," In its brief, GUA refers to a dissent by a FERC commissioner commenting on the load loss provision contained in Southern's 
FERC-approved order settlement with its LDC customers. In this dissent Commissioner Stalon stated, ""This is a classic cartel 
arrangement wherein Southern has promised its monopolistic local distribution company customers that if it bypasses their 
system to serve an end user directly, Southern will receive punishment in the form of absorption of the LDC's take or pay bill. 
This is anticompetitive . . ."" 46 FERC § 61,336. The Commission did, however, approve the settlement."

unreasonable if it has an adverse impact on competition and cannot be justified as a procompetitive measure. Seagood Trading 
Corp. v. Jerrico, Inc., 924 F.2d 1555 (11th Cir. 1991)."
308,21, GUA has not explained how Southern and Alagasco's conduct is parallel.
308,22, Southern maintains that GUA had never specified its prospective customers when it requested the tap. 
309,23," The portion of this deposition on which plaintiff purports to rely does not state that Southern has never sought another direct 
connection. Instead, the deponent stated that he was unaware of any additional contacts with industrial customers."
309,24," As previously discussed, Southern executives set forth a policy which dealt with the granting of a bypass. Major Deposition at 
112. Tutcher, however, maintains that Mark Limbaugh, a Southern representative, gave him different reasons for denying the 
taps."
309,25," After reviewing Bell, the court concludes that the case does not stand for the proposition that inconsistencies in a defendant's 
testimony were indicative of a conspiracy. Instead, the Bell court discussed inconsistencies in defendant's testimony concerning 
the reasons why he had refused to sell to the plaintiff. These inconsistent rationales raised a factual issue as to whether the 
defendant had a justified purpose in refusing to sell to the plaintiff."
309,26," The SURF negotiations refer to negotiations of long term service agreements between Southern and LDC customers. 
Alagasco's reply brief at 5."
309,27," As previously mentioned, plaintiff neglects to point out what these flaws are or how they manifest an agreement."
309,28, See supra p.4. 
310,29," As previously discussed, GUA maintains that this refusal conflicts with Southern's policy of granting a tap if it would provide 
""incremental volume."" Since Tuscaloosa Steel had not previously received gas from Southern's line, a tap from GUA would have 
provided Southern with increased volume."
310,30," GUA has not indicated how Alagasco controlled the delivery points on Southern's line. The court surmises that GUA may be 
referring to its conversations with an employee of Hunt Refining, discussed more fully below. According to GUA, a Southern 
employee had suggested to Mr. Tutcher that he contact Hunt Refining about utilizing one of its taps in the Tuscaloosa area after 
it had denied GUA its tap. A Hunt employee allegedly informed Tutcher that the company needed to contact Alagasco before it 
could grant permission to allow GUA to utilize its tap. Alagasco allegedly notified Hunt that it was opposed to the idea of Hunt 
granting GUA a tap."
310,31," The circumstances surrounding the adoption of this new policy are as follows. In 1991, Southern was allegedly seeking to 
acquire North Carolina Gas Pipeline whose major asset was a local distribution company. According to GUA, Southern's 
intended acquisition of this LDC produced concern among Southern's LDC customers. GUA claims that, following calls to 
Southern from Alagasco's Warren and others, Southern adopted a new policy concerning direct connection."
310,32," HN6[
] This section states ""Every person who shall monopolize, attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any 
other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations, 
shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding fifty thousand 
dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court."" 15 U.S.C. § 2. "
311,33," The relevant market area encompasses approximately ten miles on either side of Southern's interstate pipeline system in 
Central Alabama. Wilson affidavit. Southern has reserved its right to contest this market definition."
311,34," As previously discussed, Southern had suggested that GUA contact Hunt Refining to obtain a tap from Hunt's interconnection 
with Southern's line. Allegedly, a Hunt employee informed Tutcher that it would have to consult with Alagasco before it could 
permit GUA to take gas from Hunt's interconnection. Hunt allegedly denied GUA the right to obtain a tap after Alagasco denied it 
permission to grant the tap."
311,35," Firms controlling an essential facility have the obligation to make the facility available on nondiscriminatory terms, and the 
failure to do so subjects them to Section 2 liability. MCI v. American Telephone & Telegraph, 708 F.2d 1081, 1132 (7th Cir.),

313,39," Mr. Lowery indicated to Southern Resins-Lawler International that it would undertake the same steps should Southern Resins 
negotiate a contract with GUA. Plaintiff's Brief at 45."
313,40, It would appear to the court that this was a reasonable answer to a question rather than a threat. 
314,41," It is not clear that Hayes required a written commitment. The court does seem to suggest the lack of a commitment 
""evidenced by a bank writing"" to be a negative factor."
314,42," As previously discussed, Texline principals indicated that they would have financed the project had there been a project to 
finance."
314,43," Southern cites Martin for the proposition that a contract that contains ""infirmities"" such as contractual conditions that are 
impossible to fulfill or the absence of terms that render an agreement enforceable under state law is not a valid contract."
314,44," Southern has characterized GUA's brochure preparation and solicitations of other potential industrial end users as 
""preliminary overtures."" "
315,45," Southern also cites Hayes v. Solomon, supra, for this proposition. However, the efforts which the court found inadequate to 
constitute preparation in that case did not constitute preliminary studies as much as studies done in preparation for litigation."
315,46," See, however, Jayco, 777 F.2d at 315."
315,47," An official of Southern stated in a deposition that it had withdrawn its complaint because it was evident that it would not 
prevail. Major Deposition at 77. "
316,48," GUA maintains that Southern had ignored the results of the study. However, Southern claims that it did not adopt GUA's 
characterization of the study as showing bypass would be profitable."
316,49," Associated Gas Distributors v. FERC, 263 U.S. App. D.C. 1, 824 F.2d 981 (D.C. Cir. 1987) held that the regulatory scheme 
affecting interstate pipelines such as Southern's failed to take into account the issue of ""take or pay"" compensation."
316,50," As previously mentioned, GUA argues that Southern would have experienced an increase in volume as a result of a 
connection with Tuscaloosa Steel through GUA. "
317,51, Southern had not directly connected a customer in Alagasco's service area for 21 years.
317,52," Official Airlines Guides discusses the case of Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359, 93 S. Ct. 
1022 (1973). In Otter Tail the Supreme Court addressed the refusal of a regulated industry to sell power wholesale or to transmit 
power purchased from other sources to municipalities which owned their own retail distribution systems. In holding that Otter 
Tail's refusal to sell or distribute violated Section 2, the Court observed that monopolizing the market of transmission was used 
to further a monopoly in the market of retail distribution.  Id. at 377-379. GUA has not attempted to analogize its situation to that 
of the distributor in Otter Tail."
317,53," In its opposition, GUA has accused Southern of possessing a natural monopoly since it was the only interstate pipeline 
capable of servicing industrial end users in the market area."
317,54," To establish liability under the essential facilities doctrine, one must demonstrate (1) control of an essential facility by a 
monopolist; (2) a competitor's inability practically or reasonably to duplicate the essential facility; (3)the denial of the use of the 
facility to a competitor; (4)the feasibility of providing the facility."
317,55," Southern makes this contention in a footnote on page 33 of its brief and in the December 6 1989 letter to Dan Tutcher from 
Mark Limbaugh. "
318,56," After reviewing City of Chanute, the court concludes that Southern's assertion that this is ""directly on point"" is overstated. In 
City of Chanute, defendant had granted plaintiffs access to the pipeline. Despite Southern's assertions to the contrary in its reply 
brief, none of the extensive materials submitted to the court indicates that GUA could have otherwise gained access to 
Southern's pipeline."
318,57," In footnote 4 to its reply brief, Alagasco states that GUA incorrectly stated that Alagasco rescinded its offer to lower 
Tuscaloosa Steel's transportation rates. Alagasco asserts that GUA was referring to a proposal to buy gas on Tuscaloosa Steel's 
behalf."
318,58, Referred to as SURF negotiations.
318,59," See Mr. Furniture, supra, 919 F.2d at 1520 (holding that there must be a causal connection between the alleged antitrust 
violation and the antitrust injury for there to be antitrust standing). "
319,60, The elements of this claim have been set previously set forth.
319,61," See Public Systems Inc. v. Towry, 587 So. 2d 969-973-974 (Ala. 1991) (holding that contacting a competitor's customers 
does not constitute interference with business relations.)"
319,62," Alagasco stated that it would be unfair for it to maintain its expensive metering equipment for a company which is not paying 
for it."
319,63," In its brief, Alagasco states that Tutcher testified in his deposition that Hunt Refining had consulted with Alagasco before 
deciding whether to allow GUA to ""tie into"" Hunt's facilities and that an Alagasco employee had informed him that the company 
was opposed to the idea."
319,64," After the foregoing was prepared, the court provided the parties with a copy. Each party acknowledged that the foregoing is a 
fair and complete statement of the undisputed facts, the argued facts, the issues which must be addressed by the court and the 
parties' contentions with respect thereto."
319,65," The issue may be more one of sufficiency of evidence as to an essential element than ""standing."" Injury to business or 
property is an essential element. 15 U.S.C. § 15. Jayco does refer to a lack of ""standing."" 777 F.2d at 313. "
320,66," While the evidence may be sufficient to establish ""intention,"" the two requirements of intention and preparation are not entirely 
severable. Lack of true intention may be demonstrated by a lack of significant preparation. A lack of real intention may lead to a 
lack of preparation. In Jayco, the court said that the evidence of ""intention"" was weak, but sufficient. 777 F.2d at 314."
320,67," Mr. Herbst indicated in his deposition that Tutcher is obligated to present any venture undertaken by Midcoast Natural Gas, 
Tutcher's company, to Texline and Midcoast Transmission, another company with which Herbst is involved. Herbst Deposition at 
53."
320,68, Plaintiff has not addressed any of these contentions in its submissions to the court. 
321,69," Hayes refers to the requirements of intention, preparation and capability. Id., at 978. It also states: ""The mere possibility of 
financing being available in the abstract is not enough. Showing that someone somehow could possibly obtain financing is not 
the same as showing that plaintiffs themselves were able and prepared to do so."""
321,70," This base evidence was arguably more significant than that presented by plaintiff here. Here there is no evidence of a project 
feasibility consideration by any potential financial resource."
321,71," Cf. to plaintiff's ""contracts"" here."
321,72," Although the issue related to a jury instruction, the court extensively discussed the evidence, or lack thereof, of preparedness 
and held that ""there was ample evidence to support the jury's special verdict which found that Cable Holdings was not prepared 
to enter the western territory."" Id., at 1561."
321,73," Note 4 of Cable Holdings emphasizes the significance of the ""preparation"" requirement. It states: Cable Holdings contends that the Cobb County Board of Commissioners' decision to grant them a franchise in the western 
territory conclusively proves that they were prepared to expand their business. We disagree. Permission to enter a 
business may well precede by many months or even years a business company's ability, financially and technically, to 
implement the franchise. Id., at 1563."
321,74," See e.g., Salop, Strategic Entry Deterrence, 69 Am. Econ. Rev. 335 (1979). "
322,75, It is axiomatic that customers will change ilk they can buy the same product cheaper. 
323,76," GUA had accused Alagasco of withdrawing its offer to lower rates to Tuscaloosa Steel after GUA had been denied the taps 
by Southern. However, an Alagasco official stated in his affidavit that Tuscaloosa Steel received a discount of 53%. Wright 
Affidavit."
323,77," Pursuant to this theory, GUA accuses Southern and Alagasco of parallel conduct which is suggestive of a conspiracy."
323,78," This evidence consists of testimony from employees and officers indicating that it would lose take or pay compensation if it 
bypassed its LDC customers."
323,79," As previously mentioned, GUA has asserted that Southern would have been able to transport additional gas to Tuscaloosa 
Steel, a potential GUA customer. However, Southern has indicated that the possibility of transporting additional volume of gas is 
only one consideration in determining whether to grant a bypass of an LDC customer. "
324,80," In Jayco, Judge Goldberg stated, ""Moreover, the party opposing summary judgment may not rely merely on the pleadings or 
even on conflicting testimony, but must introduce 'significant evidence demonstrating the existence of a genuine fact issue.'"" 777 
F.2d at 308. Plaintiff has not met its burden to prove a conspiracy or other illegal agreement. "
325,81," With regard to the ""consummation of contracts"" factor, it is not clear whether this refers to contracts with the plaintiff's 
customers or its suppliers. Here, there is neither. "
330,1," A predatory price is one which is below ""some appropriate measure of cost."" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 
475 U.S. 574, 585 nn.8-9, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). "
331,2," In light of this, it is difficult to understand the dissent's apparent assertion that USA did not raise the predatory pricing issue in 
its first appeal to this court. See dissent, at 6-8. Indeed, ARCO clearly believed that USA had raised the issue; it devoted more 
than ten pages of its brief to rebutting an argument the dissent now claims was never made. See, e.g., Appellee's 1987 Brief at 
5-6, 9-10 (""The district court correctly dismissed USA's Sherman Act § 1 claim, even assuming that USA could have proved that 
ARCO and ARCO-brand dealers conspired to depress the dealers' prices and that USA suffered diminished profits as a result of 
the depressed prices.""), 35-44 (""The district court's decision is predicated on a third basic principle of antitrust law. Predatory 
pricing violative of the antitrust laws occurs only where there is a dangerous probability of successful monopolization. . . . Since 
ARCO admittedly posed no threat of monopolization, summary judgment dismissing the Section 1 claim was proper."")."
331,3," The predatory pricing conspiracy alleged in this case is merely one type of a vertical maximum price fixing agreement. A 
vertical maximum price fixing agreement requires that ARCO and its downstream purchasers have agreed to set resale prices at 
or below any level. A vertical conspiracy to predate requires that ARCO and its downstream purchasers have agreed to set 
resale prices below some appropriate measure of cost. Thus, proof of a vertical predatory pricing conspiracy in this case would 
necessarily entail proof of a maximum resale price maintenance agreement, so it was unnecessary to reach the predatory 
pricing issue if USA could prevail on its vertical maximum price fixing claim. "
332,4," Indeed, ARCO appears to concede the issue in its own motion for summary judgment: ""[We] proceed[] from the assumption 
that USA could prove that Atlantic Richfield set the retail prices of the competing distributors or dealers at levels lower than 
would have prevailed but for vertical conspiracy. . . . The allegedly conspiratorially low prices, even if illegal, did not cause USA 
injury of the type that the antitrust laws were intended to prevent."" (emphasis added). "
333,5," In Matsushita, the plaintiffs alleging the existence of a predatory pricing conspiracy sought to infer the existence of the 
conspiracy itself from ambiguous evidence. The Court rejected this attempt, holding that to survive summary judgment, ""HN9[
] a plaintiff seeking damages for a violation of section 1 must present evidence that tends to exclude the possibility that the 
alleged conspirators acted independently. Respondents in this case, in other words, must show that the inference of conspiracy 
is reasonable . . ."" 475 U.S. at 588 (citation omitted). Unlike the defendants in Matsushita, ARCO has not contested USA's 
allegation that it conspired with its dealers to set prices."
333,6," Indeed, the rule urged on us by ARCO would be perverse. Atlantic Richfield makes it clear that agreements to set maximum 
resale prices are illegal without proof of a dangerous probability of monopolization. 495 U.S. at 342. To rule in ARCO's favor in "
334,," this case would require us to conclude that agreements to set predatory prices are not illegal unless dangerous probability is 
proven. This would produce the rather remarkable result that all agreements to set maximum prices above cost are illegal, while 
only some agreements to set maximum prices below cost are illegal. We can conceive of no reason to believe the Supreme 
Court intended such a result when it decided Atlantic Richfield. "

370,11," Xerox claims that when its laser printers were first introduced into the market in 1978, assured availability was not at issue 
because at that time most of those printers were leased from Xerox and Xerox required that those machines be maintained 
under Xerox's FMSA. Plaintiffs claim that the industry practice is to provide service until manufacture of the product is 
discontinued and that Xerox's new maintenance policy was contrary to that industry practice and was designed to discourage 
the sale of used machines."

available for seven (7) years from the Original Equipment Warranty expiration date. B. For Equipment installed under a Xerox Order Agreement for Term Lease, FSM shall be available for seven (7) Years 
from the Term Lease Commencement Date. If the Equipment was installed under a Xerox Order Agreement for Equipment

control both the new and the used printer marketplace directly through Xerox."" Such a statement goes to the issue of intent only

Amerinet experienced in fact occurred because of any alleged wrongful actions of Xerox. "

sole cause of AmeriNet going out of business? A: Correct. I believe they would have survived -- Q: There were no other -- A: Yes, sir. I believe they would have survived but for the actions of Xerox. I believe that there would have been significant gross 
margin on those Xerox laser printer sales that would have enabled this entity to survive but for the actions of Xerox assuming 
liability on the part of Xerox. "

additional cash flows from the Xerox laser printer market they would have been able to penetrate the VAR market, the systems 
integration market, and also do what they had done in the past as far as the sale of IBM and other peripheral equipment. So I guess my conclusion is that they would have survived with the cash flows from the Xerox laser printer market because they

384,37," The following is the only instance in which Amerinet arguably refers to its alleged loss of non-Xerox product business: The Xerox personnel in Michigan proceeded to Meijer's location and after calling in several of Meijer's management personnel, 
pulled off the cabinetry of the unit and made disparaging and untruthful statements regarding Genesis and Genesis' equipment 
for the purpose of denigrating the business of Genesis and the products sold by Genesis. . . . The only purpose for Xerox's delay 
in installation and disparaging remarks would be to damage the business reputation of Genesis and to interfere with the 
business relationship between Meijer and Plaintiff in order to prevent any further possible transactions and to induce a breach of 
the existing contract if possible. Amended Complaint P 19."
384,38," [**59] In its memorandum in opposition to summary judgment, Amerinet argued, inter alia, for its business disparagement 
claims in the following terms: In the Meijer matter, Defendant made specific statements designed to call into question the value of the Xerox Laser Printer that 
Plaintiff was attempting to sell to Meijer. Specifically Defendant's sales and service representatives told Meijer that Plaintiff's 
equipment may not be eligible for full service maintenance. Defendant further implied that Plaintiff's equipment, after being 
placed under FSM, would still not operate at the same level as the Defendant's existing printer. Each of these statements was 
false and Defendant either knew or should have known that they were false. Defendant's statements damaged Plaintiff's reputation with its long-time customer resulting in a substantial direct loss of sales. 
In 1986, Plaintiff did approximately $ 1,000,000.00 in business with Meijer. In 1987 Plaintiff did only $ 100,000.00 in business 
directly as a result of the damage to its relationship from Defendant's derogatory statements. Amerinet's Memorandum in Opposition at 70-71."
384,39, Memorandum in Opposition at 74. 
385,40," In its complaint and amended complaint, Amerinet alleged interference with prospective business advantage and unfair 
competition. The district court deemed Amerinet's unfair competition claim a claim of tortious interference on the facts of this 
case because in Minnesota unfair competition is not itself an actionable tort, but rather, describes two specific business torts 
which are actionable, i.e. tortious interference with contractual relationships and improper use of trade secrets. The district court 
also treated Amerinet's claim of interference with prospective business advantage and its claim of interference with contractual 
relationships as stating the same claim. No party has challenged the district court's characterization of Amerinet's unfair 
competition claim as a claim for tortious interference or that court's equation of that claim with Amerinet's claim of interference 
with prospective business advantage."
385,41," Xerox has not challenged in this appeal the district court's denial of summary judgment on Amerinet's claim of tortious 
interference."
385,42," The district court also denied summary judgment on Amerinet's defamation claim. However, at the close of its case in chief, 
Amerinet withdrew its defamation claim and no issues pertaining to that claim have been raised in this appeal by either side. "
387,43," To the extent that Amerinet is contending in this appeal that Xerox's conduct constituted an unlawful restraint of trade within 
the meaning of Section 768(c), this Court disagrees, noting its affirmance supra in this opinion of the district court's grant of 
summary judgment against Amerinet with respect to the latter's antitrust claims. Amerinet has not shown how Xerox's actions 
violated any other federal or state statutory or common law anticompetitive prohibition. "
388,44," Appellant's Appendix at 787.HN30[
] -"
388,45," The only evidence of Meijer's alleged discontent with Xerox that Amerinet identifies on appeal is the trial testimony of Mr. 
Brandsey that he received a letter from Meijer ""indicating that [it] was very concerned about the performance of the Xerox 
machine that we had shipped in December of 1986 and felt that, quite frankly, Amerinet was to blame for this, and tried to 
indicate to us that we were totally at fault."" Supplemental Appendix of Appellees at 92. Ironically, Mr. Brandsey's statement 
indicates that Meijer was, if anything, unhappy with Amerinet's performance, not Xerox's. This is especially true in view of the 
evidence introduced by Amerinet at trial, that the Meijer printer, only two months after being repaired and installed, was 
operating at optimal capacity. "
390,46," Amerinet's destruction of business damage theory is apparently premised upon the allegation that Xerox's maintenance policy 
caused Amerinet to lose sales of used Xerox laser printers. Amerinet has not challenged on appeal, however, the district court's 
limiting instruction that the jury was to regard evidence concerning Xerox's maintenance policies solely as evidence with respect 
to the issue of intent. Thus, Amerinet's destruction of business theory of damages appears prima facie untenable in the light of 
the district court's said limiting instruction. This Court's discussion of the sufficiency of evidence of Amerinet's destruction of 
business damages proceeds upon the assumption, arguendo only, that Amerinet may point to evidence about Amerinet's 
alleged loss of sales of used Xerox laser printers in order to show that Amerinet produced evidence at trial of damages sufficient 
to survive a directed verdict or a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. "
391,47," In light of this opinion, all issues pertaining to Amerinet's quest for prejudgment interest and punitive damages, and Xerox's 
motion for a new trial have become moot. "

395,3," There is one allegation in the complaint that merits additional discussion: Primex's assertion that ""defendants' conduct 
threatens to eliminate plaintiffs from the electronic information business and thereby establish a monopoly in all forms of 'yellow 
pages' advertising in defendants."" This allegation differs from all the others in that it at least suggests the existence of some 
impact on the relevant market. Despite its reference to a ""monopoly,"" this allegation is insufficient.  The only harm alleged is the elimination of Primex from the 
telephonic services market; the suggestion of a monopoly is mere speculation by Primex that no other company may enter the 
field.  More important, there is no intimation of actual harm to competition.  Primex does not allege, for example, that there will 
be barriers to entry as a result of its elimination from the market.  At bottom, all that Primex is really alleging is that, if it folds, 
Pacific Bell will remain.  This is insufficient to allege an antitrust injury."

Reply, at 6-7). In support of this analysis, Varian cites three cases, all from the Southern District of New York, and all at least 30 
years old. Varian gives little guidance as to where relevant discussions appear; it provides no specific page citation in the 50-
page decision, United States v. Columbia Pictures Corp., 189 F.Supp. 153 (S.D.N.Y. 1960), nor any in the 211-page United 
States v. Morgan, 118 F.Supp. 621 (S.D.N.Y. 1953). The third citation, United States v. American Smelting and Refining Co., 
did not appear at the page cited by Varian, 1960 Trade Cas. P 69,975 (S.D.N.Y. 1960), but was located at 182 F.Supp. 834 
(S.D.N.Y. 1960). American Smelting and Refining Co. held that an arrangement between the two largest domestic competitors in 
the lead mining industry whereby one acted as exclusive seller of a portion of the production of the other in a designated area of 
the country, constituted price fixing and unlawful market allocation in violation of Sherman Act Section 1. The case does not

define products and markets covered by the Agreement as follows: "

service for the aftermarket involving equipment they have manufactured in the past, if they purchase product for any other 
purpose for those purchases they are removed from this exclusion and sales for such purposes shall be through JV and 
Richardson."

through the JV shall have the exclusive right to sell all Product [sic] to all customers for $ 5000 or less and Varian shall not take 
any such order. "
412,9," Art. VIII, P 4 sets forth the computational method by which prices are set for Varian products when sold first to the joint 
venture, and subsequently to Richardson. ""Gross Profit"" from the joint venture's sale of Varian products is defined as ""Net Sales"" 
minus ""Factory Cost"" minus ""JV expenses."" Art. VIII, P 5(c)(i) defines ""Factory Cost"" for Varian products as ""standard cost plus 
other manufacturing costs, excluding marketing and administrative costs as well as research and development costs."""
412,10," An extreme form of price-fixing is a naked cartel, which involves agreements between horizontal competitors to collaborate 
with respect to price or some market policy directly affecting price."
412,11," A merger between two or more companies usually involves an integration of resources, a subsequent resorting of functions, 
and the elimination of inefficient operations. "
413,12," An ancillary restraint, which was valid at common law, refers to a restraint on trade that is subordinate to the main lawful 
purpose of the transaction it is designed to effectuate. See Polk Bros., Inc. v. Forest City Enterprises, Inc., 776 F.2d 185, 188-89 
(7th Cir. 1985). A nonancillary restraint, by contrast, is one whose main purpose is to restrain trade and which was invalid at 
common law. In the context of joint ventures, a key question in determining the legality of an ancillary restraint is whether the 
restraint is no greater than is necessary to effectuate the legitimate business objectives of the joint venture. C. Hills, Antitrust 
Adviser § 1.14, at 23 (1985). The legality of ancillary restraints remains one of the factors considered by the courts in a rule of 
reason calculus."
413,13," Varian claims that it alone establishes the actual transfer price of Varian's products to the joint venture. Since none of the 
variables in the pricing arrangement set forth in Art. VIII(4) are assigned or agreed-upon, and since Varian has exclusive control 
over the fluctuating values of ""standard"" cost and ""other manufacturing costs,"" Varian argues that the VASCO price provisions, 
which govern the price at which Varian supplies the tubes to VASCO, do not constitute a price-fixing arrangement. (Defendants' 
Reply, at 11-13). The court is unable to comprehend the application of the pricing arrangement described in Article VIII(4) of the 
joint venture agreement, and the parties' own briefs have not shed adequate light on the matter. In the present state of the 
record, this court is not prepared to pass judgment on the legality of the VASCO pricing provisions."
413,14," The classic statement of the rule of reason was made by Justice Brandeis in Chicago Bd. of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S 
231 (1918):HN12[
] The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition 
or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition.  To determine that question the court must ordinarily 
consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the restraint was "
414,," imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the 
reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be obtained, are all relevant facts. Id. at 238."
414,15, Article VIII(4)(b) provides: 
415,," Subject to subparagraph (d) below Richardson shall pay JV and JV shall pay Varian pursuant to the sales terms of paragraph 10 
(a) of the Distributor-Requirements Agreement and upon receipt of Product, Factory Cost as defined in paragraph 5(c)(i) of this

415,16," The relevant portion of Article III states only that the ""partners shall share the profits and losses of the JV equally."""
415,17," The pertinent language of Article VIII(4)(d) states that when Varian's share of gross profits exceeds the cumulative additional 
amount over factory costs, ""payment by Richardson to JV and JV's payment to Varian upon receipt of Products subsequent 
thereto will be adjusted to keep equal Varian's and Richardson's share of Gross Profits."""
415,18," Article X, concerning the appropriation of profits, provides: ""Any profit of the JV the distribution of which is not provided for 
elsewhere in this Agreement shall be divided equally between parties."""
415,19," Article VI provides, in part, as follows: JV shall keep separate books of accounts as well as a separate General ledger. Promptly after the end of each fiscal quarter JV 
shall prepare financial statements which at a minimum shall include a balance sheet, order receipts, backlog, sales, cost of 
sales, gross profit, net profit, and such further information and reports as shall be requested by the JV Management Committee

of Varian with respect to Products shall be open to review by Richardson on a reasonable frequency during normal business 
hours. Also at the end of each fiscal quarter both the accounting staffs of Varian and Richardson shall meet to review JV 
financial statements and other accounting information. "

monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a 
felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $ 10,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any other

acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly."
419,15, U.S.C. § 18. 
420,23," The Penn-Olin Court recited a lengthy list of criteria which a trial court might consider in assessing the probability of a 
substantial lessening of competition: the number and power of the competitors in the relevant market; the background of their growth; the power of the joint venturers; 
the relationship of their lines of commerce; the competition existing between them and the power of each in dealing with the 
competitors of the other; the setting in which the joint venture was created; the reasons and necessities for its existence; the joint 
venture's line of commerce and the relationship thereof to that of its parents; the adaptability of its line of commerce to 
noncompetitive practices; the potential power of the joint venture in the relevant market; an appraisal of what the competition in 
the relevant market would have been if one of the joint venturers had entered it alone instead of through [the newly formed third 
company]; the effect, in the event of this occurrence, of the other joint venturer's potential competition; and such other factors as 
might indicate potential risk to competition in the relevant market. In weighing these factors the court should remember that the 
mandate of the Congress is in terms of the probability of a lessening of substantial competition, not in terms of tangible present 
restraint. 378 U.S. at 176-77."
420,24," Without supplying any authority for doing so, Plaintiff offers the Competitive Impact Statement not as prima facie evidence of 
Defendants' liability, but as evidence that Richardson and Varian intended to enter into a consent judgment. (Plaintiff's 
Supplemental Memorandum, at 2 n.1). In light of Varian's filing of a guilty plea in United States v. Varian Associates, Inc., 91 CR 
0946, infra note 29 and accompanying text, this court need not take judicial notice of the Competitive Impact Statement. "

421,29," The information reads, in relevant part, as follows: "
422,11," . The combination and conspiracy consisted of an agreement to adopt a program to collect rebuildable tube carcasses to keep 
them from being rebuilt by tube retailers for the purpose of raising prices of rebuilt power grid tubes and new tubes of the same 
types."
422,12," . In furtherance of the charged combination and conspiracy, the defendant and co-conspirators exchanged correspondence 
discussing the agreement to collect rebuildable tube carcasses and methods for its implementation as to rebuildable tube 
carcasses of a number of types of power grid tubes manufactured by Varian in the United States and sold by Richardson 
throughout the United States pursuant to a joint venture agreement between the defendant and Richardson"
422,13," . The rebuildable tube carcass collection agreement was intended to reduce the supply of rebuildable tube carcasses 
available to tube rebuilders and thereby to: a. increase tube rebuilders' cost for such rebuildable tube carcasses; b. restrain free and open competition for rebuildable tube carcasses, rebuilt power grid tubes, and new tubes of the same types; 
and c. deprive potential purchasers of the benefits of free and open competition in the sale of rebuilt power grid tubes and new tubes 
of the same types. (United States of America v. Varian Associates, Inc., 91 CR 0946, Information, P 10.)"
422,30," Indeed, although the guilty plea is admissible under § 5(a) to the extent that it is relevant in establishing the ultimate facts in 
issue in the subsequent suit, it seldom is sufficient, standing alone, to make the plaintiff's case, for he must prove damages to 
himself. See, e.g., Monticello Tobacco Co. v. American Tobacco Co., 197 F.2d 629, 631 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 344 U.S. 875 
(1952) (prior criminal conviction of defendants for price fixing and monopolization conspiracy insufficient for plaintiff's treble-
damage claim in the absence of proof that such conspiracy caused injury to plaintiff; ""the mere fact of conviction cannot make 
the major tobacco manufacturers liable for every business casualty in the cigarette field"")."

shall be freely given when justice so requires. "
429,1," Defendant also attacks these claims on a variety of other grounds, none of which do I reach here."
429,2," The following factual allegations reflect a consolidation of pertinent averments contained in complaints filed in Yeager's Fuel 
Inc. v. Pennsylvania Power & Light Co., Civil Action No. 91-5176 (the ""Yeager"" case), and Losch Boiler Sales & Service, Co., 
Civil Action No. 92-2359 (the ""Losch"" case). See infra section II for the procedural history of these cases. "
431,3," This case was originally assigned to Judge Van Antwerpen in accordance with this Court's procedure for the random 
assignment of cases. On May 12, 1992, the case was reassigned to me in accordance with that same procedure. The parties dispute whether Judge Van Antwerpen's order converted PP&L's entire motion to dismiss into a motion for summary 
judgment or only that portion of the motion to dismiss concerning state action immunity, for which materials beyond the 
pleadings had been submitted. The implication of this distinction is that plaintiffs' response to the converted motion for summary 
judgment only provides evidence beyond the pleadings on the state action immunity issue, while standing on the pleadings with 
regard to the sufficiency of each cause of action. PP&L, on the other hand, seeks application of the summary judgment standard 
enunciated in Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-24, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265, 106 S. Ct. 2548 (1986)(requiring parties 
responding to a motion for summary judgment to go beyond the pleadings to show that there is a genuine issue for trial), to each 
of plaintiffs' claims. Because I will grant PP&L's motion for summary judgment as to all antitrust claims under the state action 
doctrine and dismiss plaintiffs' RICO count for failure to state a claim under the Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) standard, I need not 
resolve this dispute."
431,4," Like the Yeager action, this case was originally assigned to Judge Van Antwerpen in accordance with the Court's procedure 
for the random assignment of cases. On May 15, 1992, the case was reassigned to me in accordance with that same procedure."

433,7, There was no dispute that the county waste authority lawfully owned the landfill pursuant to this statute. Id. 
434,8," Because the Supreme Court's recent reversal of this case was limited to the Third Circuit's second-prong Midcal (active state 
supervision) analysis, and the Third Circuit's first prong Midcal analysis was not even an issue upon which certiorari was 
granted, Federal Trade Comm'n v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 112 S. Ct. at 2174-76 (1992), the Third Circuit's first-prong Midcal 
analysis in Ticor is still the law of this Circuit and will be followed by this Court. To avoid confusion, I will refer to the Third 
Circuit's decision as Ticor and the Supreme Court's decision as Ticor II."
434,9, The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has not addressed the issue. Id.
434,10," ""Load Management"" refers to techniques of shifting demand for electrical power from periods of high peak usage to periods of 
time when demand is reduced. Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, Bureau of Conservation, Economics and Planning, 
Time-of-Use-Rates at 3 (1990). Because electrical energy cannot be stored effectively, electrical power plants must be designed 
to meet maximum power demand at any time. Id. Shifting power demand to ""off-peak"" times can result in reduced fuel costs and 
the deferral of new power plant construction in that ""peak"" demand will be lower, and facilities supplying that demand can be 
smaller. Id. "
435,11," Like the Pennsylvania Insurance Commission in Ticor, the PUC has been entrusted by the Pennsylvania legislature with ""full 
power and authority . . . to enforce, execute and carry out, by its regulations, orders, or otherwise, all and singular, the provisions 
of [the Code] and the full intent thereof."" 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 501(a) (Purdon 1979)(emphasis added). The PUC also has 
authority to evaluate the prudence and cost-effectiveness of ""load management"" programs. 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 1319(a). 
With such broad power to implement both the language and intent of the Code, the PUC's construction of the Code will be given 
substantial weight here. See Ticor, 922 F.2d at 1134 (quoting Masland v. Bachman, 473 Pa. 280, 374 A.2d 517, 522 (1977), for 
the proposition that in Pennsylvania, a specialized agency's interpretations of a statute it has been entrusted with implementing 
are ""'entitled to significant weight'"")."
435,12," The PUC's own policy statements may have stimulated the legislature to enact section 524 in the first place, which became 
effective July 10, 1986. In 1982, the PUC published a proposed policy statement of conservation and load management, 
suggesting that Pennsylvania electric utilities consider, inter alia, ""joint customer/company financing programs for residential and 
small commercial customers . . . [and] rate induced or company controlled load management programs."" 12 Pa. Bull. 3698 (Oct. 
9, 1982). In 1983, the PUC formally adopted this policy statement, finding authority ""to mandate the implementation of 
conservation and load management programs"" from the Code's broad conferral of power upon the PUC. 13 Pa. Bull. 3222, 3223 
(Oct. 22, 1983). This authority to mandate conservation and load management programs was subsequently called into question 
by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in June 1986 in Process Gas Consumers Group v. Pennsylvania Pub. Util. Comm'n, 511 
Pa. 88, 511 A.2d 1315 (1986). However, with the enactment of section 524 in July 1986, the Pennsylvania legislature expressly 
invested the PUC with the authority to ""order"" electric utilities to establish conservation and load management programs ""that the 
. . . [PUC] determines to be prudent and cost-effective."" See 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 1319(a)(2). "
436,13," The Pennsylvania legislature has charged the BCE &EP with studying and researching ""all matters within the [PUC's] 
jurisdiction."" 44 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 309(c)(Purdon 1979). In the words of the PUC, the BCE &EP was also meant to develop 
""an effective program of energy conservation."" 13 Pa. Bull. at 3223."
436,14, A residential thermal storage unit electrically heats water during off-peak hours for later use during peak hours. See id. at 34.
436,15," The rates specified in these tariffs are the ""lawful rates"" PP &L may charge, and PP &L is not permitted to demand or receive 
a rate greater to or less than that provided in the tariff. 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 1303 (Purdon 1979)."
436,16," If the PUC determines that tariff rates are ""unjust or unreasonable, or in anywise in violation of law,"" it must determine the 
""just and reasonable rate to be charged or applied by the public utility for the service in question."" 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 
1308(c)(Purdon 1979). See also 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 1309(a)(Purdon Supp. 1992)."
436,17," Plaintiffs present no evidence whatsoever that PP &L's programs do not have at least some load shifting effect. Plaintiffs' 
evidence consists entirely of documents suggesting that PP &L's programs may not be cost-effective and may have a coincident 
effect of increasing load and PP &L's share of the home heating market. At best, this evidence goes only to the question of how 
well PP &L's programs serve the state policy, which does not bear on whether the state policy permits the programs in the first 
place. The former question is one for the state, not this Court, to address. Cf. Town of Hallie, 471 U.S. at 44 n.7 (Federal courts 
are not required to ""embroil"" themselves in unnecessary interpretation of state statutes, which would undercut fundamental 
policy of federalism and state sovereignty in Parker.); Ticor II, 112 S. Ct. at 2177 (The second prong Midcal inquiry ""is not to 
determine whether the State has met some normative standard, such as efficiency, in its regulatory practices.""). Whether the 
state has conducted an evaluation of PP &L's programs will be addressed when I turn to Midcal's second prong. "
438,18," I also note that the teachings of Cantor have been called into question by Midcal's progeny. See, e.g., Southern Motor Rate 
Carriers, 471 U.S. at 57 n.21 (criticizing ""questionable dictum"" of Cantor). Also consider the Court's rejection in Southern Motor 
Carriers of the Cantor notion that Parker does not immunize private conduct from antitrust liability. Compare Southern Motors 
Carriers, 471 U.S. at 61 with Cantor, 428 U.S. 579 at 590-92, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141, 96 S. Ct. 3110 . See also Metro Mobile CTS 
Inc. v. Newvector Communications, Inc., 661 F. Supp. 1504, 1513 (D. Ariz. 1987), aff'd, 892 F.2d 62 (1989)(exploring 
questionable holdings of Cantor). "
439,19," Authority for the PUC to adjudicate complaints against public utilities within its jurisdiction flows from 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. 
§ 701 (Purdon 1979). PUC regulations for the handling of informal complaints appear at 56 Pa. Code § 56.161 et seq.; the 
procedure for handling formal complaints is set forth at 56 Pa. Code. § 5.21 et seq. The Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania 
has recognized HN12[
] the authority of the PUC to adjudicate complaints against public utilities within its jurisdiction of alleged 
anti-competitive conduct. See Executone of Philadelphia, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Pub. Util. Comm'n, 52 Pa. Commw. 74, 415 A.2d 
445 (1980). "
440,20," As of this date, there is no indication that the PUC has formally adopted these regulations."
440,21," I note in passing ""the close relationship between Midcal's two elements,"" identified by the Supreme Court in Ticor II, 112 S. 
Ct. at 2178. In this case, the first prong Midcal determination of whether Pennsylvania's load management policy contemplates 
programs such as PP &L's required consideration of the PUC's views on the relationship of those programs to the state policy. 
Under the second prong, the PUC's views on this relationship must be referred to again to determine whether the programs have 
been actively supervised."
440,22," Plaintiffs' argument rests upon 52 Pa. Code § 1.96, which states that the opinion of employees and representatives of the 
PUC are only considered as aids to the public and do not have the force and effect of law. . "
458,1," Plaintiff submitted, by letter dated October 16, 1991, to Dennis R. Salmon, Esq., counsel for defendants (a copy of this letter is 
attached as Exhibit G to the Declaration of Mr. Salmon filed March 16, 1992, in support of defendants' motion), the ""final"" list of 
trade secrets on which this litigation is proceeding. (This was a list of 50 trade secrets. It was amended shortly thereafter to add 
another trade secret, numbered ""5.1"" and to make minor amendments to the language of trade secret numbers 7 and 35. This 
amendment was approved by this court by order dated January 13, 1992. Also, by letter dated March 12, 1992, counsel for 
plaintiff notified this court that it was withdrawing trade secret numbers 49 and 50, leaving a total of 49.) The trade secrets that 
were the subject of the defendants' motion as originally filed were numbers 4, 8, 10, 11, 15, 17, 19, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29, 32, 
33, 38, 39, 40, 41, and 42 (as identified in plaintiff's letter of October 16, 1991)."
458,2," The alleged trade secrets with respect to which Intermedics elected not to seek relief in this litigation are numbers: 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 
10, 11, 18, 20, 29, 47, and 48. "
461,3, The court in Expert Electric also did not appear to rely upon or consider Lawlor.
461,4," The Lawlor court did not ignore the substantive policies that inform antitrust law, pointing out that construing res judicata 
doctrine to permit a second suit based on conduct that occurred after termination of the first action would help promote ""the 
public interest in vigilant enforcement of the antitrust laws."" Id., at 329. But this consideration did not play a dominant role in the 
court's analysis, which revolved for the most part around a comparison of the timing, character, and extent of the conduct that 
would be the subject of the two litigations."
461,5, Mr. Justice Harlan did not participate in the consideration or decision of the case.
461,6," Id., at 327, quoting the district court, whose holding was being reversed."
461,7," In Lawlor, for example, the Court insisted (1) that the question of whether the two suits could be said to involve ""essentially the 
same course of wrongful conduct"" was not ""decisive"" and (2) that the first action would not act as a bar to the second regardless 
of ""whether the defendants' conduct be regarded as a series of individual torts or as one continuing tort"". Lawlor, at 327 and 328. "
462,8," Defendants cite Ashton-Tate Corp. v. Ross, 916 F.2d 516, 523-24 (9th Cir. 1990); Whittaker Corp. v. Execuair Corp., 736 F.2d 
1341, 1345-46; Monolith Portland Midwest Co. v. Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp., 407 F.2d 288, 292-93 (9th Cir. 1969), all 
of which held that, for statute of limitations purposes, a cause of action for trade secret misappropriation arises only once. 
See also, Davies v. Krasna, 14 Cal. 3d 502, 511-15, 121 Cal. Rptr. 705, 535 P.2d 1161 (1975). For example, the court in 
Monolith held: California does not treat trade secrets as if they were property. It is the relationship between the parties at the time the secret is 
disclosed that is protected. . . . The fabric of the relationship once rent is not torn anew with each added use or disclosure, 
although the damage suffered may thereby be aggravated. The cause of action arises but once, and recovery for the wrong is 
barred within two years thereafter unless the statute has been effectively tolled. Monolith, supra, 407 F.2d at 293."
462,9," Elsewhere in their papers defendants explicitly acknowledge that this fourth factor is the most important in the Constanti 
analysis and insist that this court's analysis of the res judicata issues be governed by the law as articulated in Constantini. "
463,10," Excepting, presumably, the issues of whether the alleged trade secrets were trade secrets in the first place and whether the 
individual defendants had access to them during their tenure with the plaintiff company. "
465,11," We also are unimpressed with plaintiff's argument that this court purported to distinguish ""use"" from ""disclosure"" during the 
May 19 hearing and that defendants' moving papers did not adequately notify plaintiff that defendants were basing their motion 
on disclosures or uses of the alleged trade secrets. There are at least two places in their opening memorandum where 
defendants explicitly use both terms. Moreover, it is simply incredible to suggest that counsel for plaintiff believed that 
defendants intended to limit the scope of their motion in such a self-defeating manner, especially given the indisputably 
embryonic state of Ventritex's product development efforts in the spring of 1986. We hereby warn counsel for plaintiff that we are 
not pleased with his efforts to claim that he justifiably relied on strained interpretations of statements by this court taken out of 
context."
465,12," Although P 3 of the Cello declaration establishes that document V104895 was generated by December 13, 1985, defendants 
do not contend, and the evidence does not establish, that this document by itself discloses Alleged Trade Secret #4. Rather, of 
these documents, we find the most important to be documents V104977 and V104980. See Brubaker decl.(filed March 18, 
1992), pp.4-7."
465,13," These are Bates stamped documents V105009, V105065, and V105066. As to the date of their generation, see Cello decl. at 
PP 27-29. "
466,14," Mr. Pless seems to concede that some circuits, those that use ""off-the-shelf components,"" do not lend themselves to 
miniaturization. We infer that one of the major tasks Ventritex faced in attempting to develop an implantable defibrillator was to 
redesign circuits that could deliver the desired service to the heart but only through an external device. See Pless Decl. of June 
2, 1992, at para. 3, p.2. "
476,1," Soon after the trial was completed Congress passed the Higher Education Amendments of 1992. Pub. L. No. 102-325, 106 
Stat. 448 (1992). Section 1544 of the Amendments makes lawful, for a two year period, certain Ivy Overlap Group activity which 
is the subject of this civil action. Section 1544 states in its entirety: (a) Effect on Pending Cases Prohibited. Nothing in this section shall in any way be construed to affect any antitrust litigation 
pending on the date of enactment of this Act. (b) In General. Except as provided in subsections (a), (c), and (e), institutions of higher education may -- (1) voluntarily agree with any other institution of higher education to award financial aid not awarded under the Higher Education 
Act of 1965 to students attending those institutions only on the basis of demonstrated financial need for such aid; and (2) discuss and voluntarily adopt defined principles of professional judgment for determining student financial need for aid not 
awarded under the Higher Education Act of 1965. (c) Exception. Institutions of higher education shall not discuss or agree with each other on the prospective financial aid award to 
a specific common applicant for financial aid. (d) Related Matter. No inference of unlawful contract, combination, or conspiracy shall be drawn from the fact that institutions of 
higher education engage in conduct authorized by this section. (e) Sunset provision. This section shall expire on September 30, 1994. Due to the Effect on Pending Cases Prohibition clause and the fact that the statute is limited in duration, the court will issue its 
opinion without regard to these provisions."
476,2," The existence of interstate commerce is both a jurisdictional requirement and an element of the substantive offense. Cardio-
Medical Assoc., Ltd. v. Crozer-Chester Medical Center, 721 F.2d 68, 71 (3d Cir. 1983). MIT concedes that the activities 
challenged in this case are sufficiently interstate in nature. MIT sends brochures and applications to prospective students in 
every state and admits many non-Massachusetts residents. In addition, MIT receives charitable contributions from individuals 
and corporations from around the country. Accordingly, the court will not address this issue."
476,3," MIT's status as a nonprofit corporation, on its own, does not shield its conduct from the Sherman Act. See American Soc'y of 
Mechanical Engineers, Inc. v. Hydrolevel Corp., 456 U.S. 556, 577, 102 S.Ct. 1935, 1948, 72 L. Ed. 2d 330 (1982) (""It is beyond 
debate that nonprofit organizations can be held liable under the antitrust laws.""). "
477,4," Presumably, however, under Marjorie Webster, once a court finds that such a restraint was commercially motivated, the court 
would examine the restraint's reasonableness and effects, irrespective of motivation. See Association for Intercollegiate Athletics 
for Women v. National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 236 U.S. App. D.C. 311, 735 F.2d 577, 583 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 1984)."
477,5," The Court did specify, however, that distinctions between businesses and professions are meaningful in other contexts, 
particularly when evaluating whether a particular restraint is lawful. See discussion of Goldfarb, infra. "
479,6," The court held that the establishment of a price for the blanket licenses was an incidental, albeit necessary, consequence of 
the creation of the licenses themselves. Further, the licensing system did not place any restraints on the ability of copyright 
owners to sell their compositions. "
480,7," The court's refusal to adopt a per se approach is not based, as MIT urges, upon the lack of experience among courts with 
regard to Overlap agreements. See Topco Associates, 405 U.S. at 607-08, 92 S.Ct. at 1133 (""It is only after considerable "
481,," experience with certain business relationships that courts classify them as per se violations of the Sherman Act""). As the 
Supreme Court commented in Maricopa, 457 U.S. at 349 n.19, 102 S.Ct. at 2475, this argument confuses ""the established 
position that a new per se rule is not justified until the judiciary obtains considerable rule-of-reason experience with the particular 
type of restraint challenged."" (italics in original; underline added). The challenged conduct in the present case involves price 
fixing, which is hardly a new type of restraint."
481,8," An educational counselor for MIT succinctly explained the relationship between costs and the college selection process: [Students] are always concerned about money. They are always concerned about money. They are typically concerned less 
about whether the curriculum is right for them or not. That's sort of a second tier kind of a thinking, people don't get to that while 
they are applying a lot of times. (N.T. 1515). "
482,9," MIT contends that while economic theory can predict the behavior of a for-profit firm, since by definition its primary motivation 
is profit-maximization, economic theory cannot predict the consequences of cooperative behavior among non-profit institutions 
such as colleges, since non-profit educational institutions have diverse interests, some of which may conflict with the goal of 
profit-maximization. MIT contends that basic economic theory rejects a presumption that bona fide non-profit organizations that 
act cooperatively will do so in a way that harms the consumer. The government's expert economist, on the other hand, testified that institutions of higher education are motivated to collude, 
just as profit-maximizers are. According to the government's economist, colleges compete for many things such as students, 
faculty, and financial support. By minimizing the competition for students, the schools can increase their revenue as compared to 
costs. Since these institutions do not distribute profit among owners, the decision-makers can consume these increases in other 
ways, such as greater travel funds, higher faculty salaries, improved facilities, etc. According to the government's economist, the 
only distinction between for-profit and non-profit entities is the way in which they consume profit--for-profit entities distribute 
profits among the owners, while non-profit entities distribute profits within the organization. This distinction, concludes the 
government's expert, has no significance economically. Both the government and MIT set out to substantiate their theories and demonstrate empirically what each believed to be the 
proper relationship between Ivy Overlap Agreements and the price of an Overlap institution education, or, phrased differently, 
whether the price for an education rose as a result of Overlap. Both experts agreed that price is properly defined as average net 
revenue per student, but the similarity in approaches ended there. The government's economist chose to compare the average 
net revenue per student of the Ivy Overlap Group schools with the average net revenue per student of several different schools 
which he deemed to be comparable. MIT's expert conducted a multiple regression analysis, a method which permits an 
economist to isolate a single variable in a multiple-variable environment. Only by controlling for numerous factors which could 
have an effect on net price, according to MIT's economist, is it possible to gauge accurately Overlap's effect on net price. To that 
end, his study compared over 220 institutions with available data. Not surprisingly, each economist arrived at very different 
conclusions. The government's comparisons showed that the average net revenue per student for the Ivy Overlap schools was 
generally higher than the average net revenue per student for other comparable schools. The difference, according to the 
government's expert, was economically significant and demonstrated that the Overlap process had an effect of raising the 
average net revenues of the Ivy Overlap Group schools. MIT's regression analysis, on the other hand, revealed no demonstrable 
statistical effect of Overlap on average net price per student. MIT's expert concluded, as a result, that the Ivy Overlap schools 
did not take in more revenue as a result of Overlap, as it would have in Overlap's absence."
482,10," The government presented an array of studies and comparisons purporting to demonstrate tangible anticompetitive effects of 
Overlap. The government points out that the Ivy Needs Methodology taxes a larger amount of income and assets for the family 
contribution determination than does the Congressional Methodology. The effect of this, according to the government's 
economist, is that the agreed-upon financial contributions was greater than it would have been had the Ivy Needs Methodology 
not been employed. The government also presented comparisons showing that the needy and minorities, the two groups MIT 
asserts are the direct beneficiaries of Overlap, had higher family contributions as a result of Overlap as well. "
483,," Further, the government demonstrated how the Spring Meeting negatively affected the economic opportunities available to 
students. The government's economist examined the bilateral rosters that MIT had with each of the Ivy League schools for 1988, 
paying special attention to handwritten changes that were made to the family contribution figures at the Spring Meeting, to the 
extent the changes were decipherable. He then compared the average family contribution of all the schools before changes 
were made with the average family contribution of all schools after changes were made. This comparison revealed that the 
changes made at the bilateral meeting did not result in a economically significant increase to the schools' average family 
contribution. This did not mean that there was not a significant impact on the price paid by students and their families, however. 
To demonstrate, the government's economist posed the following hypothetical: Before the Spring Meeting, student x had a 
family contribution, as calculated by MIT, of $ 2,000, and a family contribution, as calculated by Harvard, of $ 6,000. At the 
bilateral meeting, MIT and Harvard met in the middle and agreed that student x's family contribution would be $ 4,000. This 
would obviously mean that MIT's family contribution is up, Harvard's is down, and as to the average for the two schools, there 
has been no change. From the perspective of student x and his or her family, however, their ""best financial opportunity"" has 
increased by $ 2,000. The government's economist defined ""best financial opportunity"" as the difference between the lowest 
price that family faced before the reconciliation and that which it faced after the reconciliation. He found that on average, the 
""best financial opportunity"" for those students whose family contribution was changed at the 1988 bilateral meetings increased 
by $ 1,091, a figure which he deemed to be economically significant. MIT assailed the accuracy of the government's data and challenged the significance of the conclusions that the government 
sought the court to draw from this evidence. Much of MIT's criticism was sound. "
502,1," The concept of per se violations allows the court to forego any inquiry into the actual anticompetitive effects of the alleged 
violations. The United States Supreme Court has stated: HN5[

redeeming virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise 
harm. Northern Pac. Ry. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5, 78 S.Ct. 514, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1983) (1958). "
503,2," Certain activities such as resale price maintenance that have achieved per se status under section 1 of the Sherman Act are 
not included in Minn. Stat. § 325D.53. The absence of resale price maintenance may be explained by the fact that in 1971 
Minnesota still had a fair trade act that allowed vertical price-fixing in some circumstances. Minn. Stat. §§ 325.08-325.14.

513,2," The exact agenda and purpose of the meeting is disputed. The government contended, and the jury apparently found, that the 
dentists met with the intention of exerting pressure on the plans to increase fees. The dentists claimed, however, that the topic of 
the meeting was a new co-payment schedule proposed by the plans, and that the letter-writing campaign was undertaken at the 
behest of the president of one of the plans as a pro forma ""show of force"" to help the plans justify increasing the fees in Tucson 
to match those in Phoenix."

] There is no double jeopardy problem, however, where a defendant will not be subjected

95 S. Ct. 1013 (1975), where ""reversal [of a district court's order] on appeal would merely reinstate the jury's verdict, review of

515,6," The district judge also noted that this criminal prosecution ""bothered"" his ""sense of fair play"" when contrasted with the civil

542,1," The appellant is composed of several divisions, including the Marva Maid Dairy, the principal focus of this prosecution. The 
appellant shall be referred to alternatively as ""the Cooperative"" or ""Marva Maid."""
542,2, References in the opinion to the procurement of milk or school milk contracts will include milk and its associated products. 
543,3," Elliott was originally interested in getting the Hampton school account because of its close proximity to Marva Maid's 
operations, but settled on the Williamsburg contract, which is also relatively close to Marva Maid's operations."
543,4," Because they knew what the bid prices were for the prior year and what cost increases had occurred during the school year, 
bidding ""high"" entailed submitting a bid that would ""exceed that range sufficiently as to--not to be a real contender"" on the 
contract. J.A. at 324, 327, 330."
543,5, Elliott and Stamper essentially agreed on the approximate amount of their bids to deflect any signs of collusion or bid rigging. 
544,6," Shortly thereafter, Elliott was demoted in May 1986 and finally dismissed in December 1986. Elliott was not demoted for his 
bid rigging activities, rather he was dismissed because the board of directors believed Elliott was too aggressive in the 
marketplace and disliked the fact that he was destabilizing the market and upsetting the status quo. In July 1986, Neale took 
over as division manager at Marva Maid. Elliott testified that Neale was pleased about and condoned the bid rigging agreement. "
547,7," We recently granted appellant's motion to correct and supplement the record based on appellant's suggestion that there were 
""Elliott interview notes notes"" submitted to Judge Doumar in a related case, United States v. Hughes, Cr. Action No. 92-25-N, 
United States District Court of the Eastern District of Virginia, Norfolk Division, that were not submitted to Judge MacKenzie. We 
have conducted an in camera inspection of the ""Elliott interview notes"" submitted to Judge Doumar in Hughes and conclude they 
are identical, with the following exception, to the notes submitted to Judge MacKenzie and this court. Notes taken by the 
government after the Cooperative's trial were also proffered to this court pursuant to its order granting appellant's motion to 
correct and supplement the record. These notes, taken by the government while interviewing Elliott, were obviously not required 
to be produced to Judge MacKenzie because they did not exist at the time of the Cooperative's trial. "
550,8," We also note that strictly applying the harmless test to the case at bar, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

551,9," Courts have uniformly held that the limitations period extends until either final payments are received under the illegal 
contracts or the illicit gains are finally distributed among coconspirators. See United States v. Dynalectric Co., 859 F.2d 1559 
(11th Cir. 1988); United States v. Evans & Associates Construction Co., 839 F.2d 656 (10th Cir. 1988); United States v.

290 (9th Cir. 1981), cert. dismissed, 454 U.S. 1167 (1982). "
552,10," Indeed, Elliott testified that he knew bid rigging was illegal. "
553,11," We also find no merit to Marva Maid's arguments that the district court's jury instruction on the Sherman Act count was 
improper, Smith Grading, 760 F.2d at 533 and Part VI, infra, and that its bid rigging agreement to fix the price of processed milk 
is exempt under the Sherman Act as ""state action."" Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341 (1943)."
553,12," Marva Maid's factual predicate for this argument is somewhat misleading. Elliott testified that he submitted a more competitive 
bid in 1985 only because of competition other than Pet Dairy. In the years 1984 and 1986, Marva Maid submitted non-
competitive bids on the Newport News school milk contract. "
554,13," At its inception, the scheme to defraud intended to deprive the City of Newport News of money or property. Thereafter, Elliott 
decided to submit a ""more competitive"" bid when he became aware that other dairies were competing for the 1985-86 Newport 
News contract."
554,14," We also find Marva Maid's contention that the district court's jury instruction on the mail fraud counts was improper to be 
without merit. "
555,15," Other dairies who pleaded guilty to similar conduct were fined between $ 300,000 and $ 6,000,000. "
565,1," O.K. Sand's First Amended Complaint has been superseded, and the Court interprets O.K. Sand's motion for summary 
judgment as attacking the operative, Second Amended Complaint. "
566,2," Martin Marietta claims that in 1986, Mr. Kopetsky gave Martin Marietta the independent authority to establish the ""List Prices"" 
and make sales at prices exceeding 10% or 20% below ""List Prices"" without O.K. Sand's prior consent. In support of this claim, 
Martin Marietta cites the deposition testimony of its sales manager, John Schuler: Q. What provisions did you think were changed by your discussions with Mr. Kopetsky? A. That we no longer sat down and went over and had a mutual understanding on list price each year. Q. All right. So you understood after '85 that Martin Marietta could establish a list price without Mr. Kopetsky's prior 
consent? A. On Mr. Kopetsky's okay, I did that, yes, sir. Schuler Deposition, p. 119-120. O.K. Sand, however, claims that it never gave Martin Marietta such authority, and in support thereof, cites Kopetsky's deposition 
testimony: A. The only instructions that I ever gave John Schuler was that he had the sales and that he had the right to sell it at the 
prices was [sic] on our contract, and that's the only thing that John and I discussed. Kopetsky's Deposition, p. 76."
566,3," Martin Marietta provided at least one O.K. Sand employee with specific price information regarding sales to one customer, 
Potter Material. "
567,4," For example, if a customer bought one ton of type A product at one dollar per ton and a second ton of type B product at 5 
dollars per ton, the Invoice Register would report only that two tons of product were sold for a total of six dollars. Martin Marietta 
claims that from this data, O.K. Sand could calculate that the customer had paid an average of three dollars per ton."
567,5," O.K. Sand claims this figure to be 3,105.05. See O.K. Sand's Brief in Opposition to Martin Marietta's Motion for Summary 
Judgment, Appendix I, p. 18."
567,6," Martin Marietta explains that if it sold the 806.3 tons of Fill Dirt at 20% off the list price (80 cents per ton), to reach an average 
of one dollar per ton for 3,040.95 tons, it must have also sold something like 2,234.65 tons of Fill Sand, the next cheapest O.K. 
Sand product, for $ 1.07 per ton, which is 13 cents per ton below 20% off the list price for Fill Sand. The Court notes that there are several problems with this analysis, however, beyond the difficulties inherent in making these 
calculations. The document Martin Marietta refers to in determining how much product was sold per month was not even created 
until some eight months after Martin Marietta printed and distributed the August 1984 Invoice Register; it was created by Alice L. 
Huffman, who was not even hired as O.K. Sand's bookkeeper until April of 1985. In addition, the August 1984 Invoice Register 
reports that Customer No. 322727 made several ""negative"" purchases, whatever that means, of a one-dollar product in August 
of 1984. For example, the Invoice Register reports: Inv. No. Cust. No. Tons Matl Amount"

No. 322727 with respect to these transactions actually comes out to be negative number because the negative dollar entries 
exceed the positive dollar entries."" Id. Further, without Customer No. 322737's one dollar purchases, the total amount of product 
that sold for an average of one dollar per ton amounted to only 340.30 tons, well within the 806.3 tons of Fill Dirt actually sold in

568,7," Alice L. Huffman, O.K. Sand's bookkeeper since April of 1985, testified in her deposition that Martin Marietta supplied O.K. 
Sand with a separate list of customer names and corresponding customer numbers."
568,8," Martin Marietta claims that had O.K. Sand cross-referenced Customer No. 398222 with a customer list, it would have 
discovered that Customer No. 398222 was in fact Independent Concrete Pipe. Martin Marietta further claims that it sold 
Customer No. 398222 (Independent Concrete Pipe) ""no. 24 sand (also called concrete sand or 14-2 sand) and various sizes of 
gravel at least in part from [the] O.K. [Belmont facility.] (Affidavit of Steve DuBois, Fxs. 1-4)."" Memorandum in Support of Martin 
Marietta's Motion for Summary Judgement on O.K.'s First Amended Complaint, p. 11. Martin Marietta claims that had O.K. Sand examined invoices 5045029, 505355, 5058419, and 5062530, all Customer No. 
398222 a/k/a/ Independent Concrete Pipe purchases, it would have known that Independent Concrete Pipe paid on average $ 
2.18, $ 1.87, $ 1.91, $ 1.90, per ton per invoice in August 1985. Martin Marietta claims that had O.K. Sand made these calculations and compared them to the list prices for 1985, it would have 
discovered that these average prices were more than 10% or 20% below the ""List Prices"" for no. 24 sand or any size gravel in 
1985; Martin Marietta claims that the lowest price for no. 24 sand or any size gravel in 1985 was $ 3.50. Martin Marietta does not 
explain, however, how O.K. Sand would have known that Independent Concrete Pipe was only buying No. 24 sand and gravel; 
despite Martin Marietta's citation to Exhibits 1 through 4 of Steve DuBois' affidavit, those exhibits and DuBois's affidavit are 
unenlightening in this regard. "
569,9," Huffman testified she did not know that under the Sales Agency Agreement Martin Marietta was allowed to sell O.K. Sands 
products 10% or 20% below list prices: I never tried to figure ten percent or any percent. I only went with my list price and what was paid here and I never even 
tried to figure percent. I did not know anything about a percent. Huffman Deposition, p. 202."
569,10," The parties agree that it is common in the sand and gravel industry not to allow nonessential personnel or ""employees in the 
scale house"" access to actual prices, in fear that ""truckers and other competitors"" might gain access to it. The parties do not 
agree, however, about whether Alice Huffman was an ""employee in the scale house"" or the type of employee who is normally 
denied access to pricing information, nor do the parties agree that Martin Marietta's conduct toward Huffman was reasonable 
and in accord with the industry practice."
569,11," The ASPAP documents reported how many tons of each particular product were sold and the average price Martin Marietta 
received for each product for a particular month (and for the year to date.) The ASPAP documents also reported the total 
amount of product ""Transferred to Martin Marietta"" and the total amount Martin Marietta paid for the ""transferred"" products. "
570,12," O.K. Sand also claims that ""through its counsel Tom Blankenship, [O.K. Sand] requested an accounting of additional 
information in communications with Martin Marietta in late 1988 and early 1989."" See O.K. Sand's Brief in Opposition to Martin 
Marietta's Motion for Summary Judgment, Appendix I at p. 27. Although the Court recognizes that Blankenship is the author of

establish a genuine issue of fact on this issue. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 (e). "

571,14," O.K. Sand also moves for summary judgment on the grounds that Martin Marietta's Clayton Act claim is jurisdictionally 
deficient in two respects. First, O.K. Sand claims that Martin Marietta's counterclaim fails to cross the ""Clayton Act's jurisdictional 
threshold,"" in that Martin Marietta fails to show there was an exclusive agreement. Second, O.K. Sand claims that Martin 
Marietta has failed to allege facts within the jurisdictional ambit of the Clayton Act's ""in any line of commerce"" requirement. In

579,19," Martin Marietta also submits evidence that O.K. Sand was ""very well satisfied"" and profitable in 1986 and 1987. However, 
whether O.K. Sand was satisfied and profitable prior to September of 1988, when Martin Marietta claims O.K. Sand started 
making plans to switch to AA, is largely irrelevant. Of course O.K. Sand was at least partially satisfied with Martin Marietta from 
1985 to 1988, when it allowed the agency agreement to renew each of those years. The relevant inquiry is why O.K. Sand 
terminated or refused to renew the agency agreement in January of 1989."
579,20," Even if the Court assumes that O.K. Sand was happy with Martin Marietta up until the point of termination, that is not 
evidence that O.K. Sand terminated the agency agreement to price fix with American Aggregates; under the agency agreement

defendants are acting in conformity with a clearly articulated state policy, and (2) whether there is supervision by the State of the 
defendant's challenged activity. Although both Plaintiffs and Defendants appear to believe that active state supervision is 
required for the municipality to avail itself of state action immunity, the Court does not find that to be a requirement. In Hallie v. City of Eau Claire, 471 U.S. 34, 47, 85 L. Ed. 2d 24, 105 S. Ct. 1713 (1985), the Supreme Court held that a 
municipality need not demonstrate that the state actively supervised its allegedly anticompetitive conduct in order to be eligible 
for state action immunity. The Court explained: Where a private party is engaging in the anticompetitive activity, there is a real danger that he is acting to further his own 
interests, rather than the governmental interests of the State. Where the actor is a municipality, there is little or no danger that it 
is involved in a private price-fixing arrangement. The only real danger is that it will seek to further purely parochial public 
interests at the expense of more overriding state goals. This danger is minimal, however, because of the requirement that the 
municipality act pursuant to a clearly articulated state policy. Once it is clear that state authorization exists, there is no need to 
require the State to supervise actively the municipality's execution of what is a properly delegated function. The actions of which Plaintiffs complain in Count I include a conspiracy between Auburn and MMWAC. As will be shown infra in 
the text, MMWAC is not a private party either and is entitled to state action immunity in its own right. The Supreme Court made 
clear in City of Columbia that there is no conspiracy exception to the doctrine of state action immunity. City of Columbia, 113 L. 
Ed. 2d at 394. Although the Court in City of Columbia alluded to a possible market participant exception to state action immunity, 
this Court does not think such an exception, if found to exist, would apply in this case. Although MMWAC participates in the 
waste disposal market, it is not acting as a private firm. See Fisichelli, 956 F.2d at 14. Rather, in setting up and operating the "
593,," waste disposal plant, MMWAC is performing a police power function required of municipalities. These actions were impelled by 
State policy, and private market concerns were not a dominant purpose. See Union Pacific Railroad v. United States, 313 U.S. 
450, 467, 85 L. Ed. 1453, 61 S. Ct. 1064 (1941)(cited by Court in City of Columbia as possible example of market participant 
exception)."
593,8," The Court has not seen the actual interlocal agreement between the municipalities specifying the powers delegated to 
MMWAC under it. See 30-A M.R.S.A. § 2203. It is clear from the complaint and the contract attached to it, however, that 
MMWAC received from the municipalities the power to enter into waste handling agreements as contemplated in 38 M.R.S.A. § 
1304-B. "
594,9," In fact, under the statute MMWAC could have entered into a contract granting a monopoly for the ""collection"" and 
""transportation"" of waste to the Waste Management Defendants. See 38 M.R.S.A. § 1304-B(4)(A)."
594,10," Various portions of the Maine's waste management statute refer to the authority of municipalities to control waste generated 
within their borders. See 38 M.R.S.A. §§ 1304-B(1) and 1304-B(4); Midcoast Disposal, Inc. v. Town of Union, 537 A.2d 1149, 
1151 n.4 (Me. 1988). Despite this express grant of authority, the statute also clearly contemplates that the municipality may have 
to procure and use solid waste from areas outside the participating municipalities in fulfilling the statutory intent. Section 1304-
B(4-A)(B) provides that no contract for waste disposal, transportation or handling services may prevent a municipality from 
meeting its obligations to supply minimum BTU or tonnage levels required by the contract by using waste generated outside its 
borders. By implication the Legislature clearly expected that municipalities, or their surrogates, might by the long-term contracts 
permitted them arrange to procure the steady stream of waste necessary to effectively implement the legislative solid waste 
policy from outside the municipality, as MMWAC has here. "
595,11," As described above in the text, MMWAC's alleged acts are properly delegated and undertaken pursuant to a clearly 
articulated state policy, so it need not show active state supervision in order to qualify for state action immunity. Hallie v. City of 
Eau Claire, 471 U.S. at 47 (1985). "
596,12," In Riverview Investments, Inc. v. Ottawa Community Improvement Corp., 774 F.2d at 163, modifying 769 F.2d 324, 329, the 
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, citing Town of Hallie and Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v. United States, 
but without further explanation, requires active supervision by the State of actions by a private entity even when that entity is 
engaged by a municipality. This Court agrees with the Court in Vartan v. Harristown Development Corp., 661 F. Supp. 596, 601 
(M.D. Pa. 1987), aff'd 838 F.2d 1206 (3rd Cir. 1988), that the approach discussed in the text is the more appropriate one. "
597,13," In Tisei v. Town of Ogunquit, 491 A.2d 564, 570 (Me. 1985), the Law Court refers to ""the general police powers to control 
waste disposal."" "
598,14," The Court notes that Plaintiffs' § 1983 claim for injunctive relief for Defendants' alleged selective prosecution would be barred 
even if it had been appropriately pleaded. As the Court of Appeals stated in Willhauck v. Halpin, 953 F.2d at 711: An allegation that selective or vindictive prosecution has occurred in violation of due process should ordinarily be raised as a 
defense to such a prosecution. Once such prosecution had begun, a § 1983 action for injunctive relief to prevent the alleged 
violation of the due process rights of the state defendant would be barred. See Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 27 L. Ed. 2d 669, 
91 S. Ct. 746 (1971). The enforcement action by Auburn and MMWAC against Plaintiffs, in which selective prosecution and many of the other claims 
raised by Plaintiffs in this action are being litigated, was decided adversely to Plaintiffs by Maine Superior Court on July 20, 
1992. That decision is currently on appeal to the Maine Law Court."
598,15," After addressing the relationship between the tort of negligence and compliance with statutory mandates, the treatise then 
discusses administrative regulation: ""Where there is a normal situation, clearly identical with that contemplated by the statute or 
regulation, and no special circumstances or danger are involved, it may be found and can be ruled as a matter of law, that the 
actor has done his full duty by complying with the statute, and nothing more is required."" "
605,1," As this court noted in the Powell litigation: Under the Right of First Refusal/Compensation system, every NFL club retains rights to ""its players"" even though, in the case of 
veteran free agents, contractual rights to a player no longer exist. When a veteran player's contract has expired and a competing 
NFL club makes an offer to that player, the player's old team may keep the player simply by matching the competing offer; the 
player's old club therefore is said to have a ""right of first refusal"" as to the player's services. If the competing offer is large 
enough, and the club to which the player was previously under contract does not choose to match a competing offer, the old club 
will receive draft choice ""compensation"" which may be extremely costly to the acquiring club. [The Powell] plaintiffs allege that in 
addition to restraining player movement, this system effectively eliminated competition among NFL clubs for player services. Powell v. National Football League, 678 F. Supp. 777, 779 (D. Minn. 1988), rev'd on other grounds, 930 F.2d 1293 (8th Cir. 
1989), cert. denied, 112 L. Ed. 2d 700, 111 S. Ct. 711 (1991). "
606,," Plaintiffs in McNeil v. National Football League also alleged, and the jury so found, that the Plan B Rules substantially restrain 
competition in the relevant market for professional football players's services. See infra n.2."
606,2," The McNeil case involved eight professional football players whose contracts expired on February 1, 1990, and alleged injury 
resulting from their restriction under the Right of First Refusal/Compensation Rules of Plan B for the 1990 and 1991 seasons. 
See, e.g., McNeil v. National Football League, 790 F. Supp. 871 (discussing players' antitrust claims challenging the legality of 
Right of First Refusal/Compensation Rules and also the wage scale proposed under Plan B); Powell and McNeil v. National 
Football League, 764 F. Supp. 1351, 1359 (D. Minn. 1991) (discussing underpinnings of McNeil litigation). The McNeil case came before the court in a jury trial beginning June 15, 1992. On September 8, 1992, the case was submitted 
to the jury by way of a special verdict and the jury returned its answers on September 10, 1992. The jury found that the Right of 
First Refusal/Compensation Rules in Plan B have a substantially harmful effect on competition in the relevant market for the 
services of professional football players, that those rules significantly contribute to competitive balance in the NFL, but that the 
rules are more restrictive than reasonably necessary to achieve the objective of establishing or maintaining competitive balance 
in the NFL. The jury further found that all of the plaintiffs suffered economic injury as a direct result of the Right of First 
Refusal/Compensation Rules in Plan B, and determined the following monetary damages (before trebling) as a direct result of 
those rules: Mark Collins, $ 178,000; Don Majkowski, $ 0; Tim McDonald, $ 0; Freeman McNeil, $ 0; Frank Minnifield, $ 50,000; 
Niko Noga, $ 0; Dave Richards, $ 240,000; and Lee Rouson, $ 75,000. After taking the verdict, the court denied on the record defendants' requests to enter judgment in their favor on the issue of the 
legality of Plan B and to enter judgment in their favor on the claims of the four players whose monetary damage awards were 
zero. "
607,3, See supra note 2.
607,4," The issue of the illegality of the Plan B rules also encompasses various other rulings in McNeil, for example, the termination of 
the nonstatutory labor exemption. Powell and McNeil v. National Football League, 764 F. Supp. 1351, 1355-59 (D. Minn. 1991) 
(decision only in McNeil). "
608,5," Those four players are Keith Jackson, Webster Slaughter, D.J. Dozier, and Garin Veris. Plaintiffs concede that the remaining 
six players are unable to demonstrate a threat of irreparable harm unless defendants impose another system like Plan B, in 
which case the two players who are currently without contracts may again be subject to some system of restraint."
608,6, See supra note 2 (detailing jury's findings in McNeil).
608,7, That conclusion is further supported by testimony in the McNeil case. 
609,8," As the court instructed the jury in the McNeil case: According to defendants, competitive balance means that all of the NFL teams are of sufficiently comparable playing strength to 
provide competitive and high quality games that are close, exciting and well-played, and thus interesting to fans. McNeil Jury Instruction No. 19."
609,9," Those four teams are the Philadelphia Eagles, the Detroit Lions, the Cleveland Browns and the New England Patriots."
609,10," Those four football clubs, however, are currently without the services of those four players."
609,11," The court acknowledges that the impact may be more severe on four individual teams, but notes that those teams may still be 
able to negotiate and sign the players after injunctive relief is granted. Moreover, as the court determined in McCourt when 
evaluating the balance of harms that would flow from enjoining the reserve system in professional hockey: no [team] is threatened with an injury comparable to [a player's] irreparable harm [if restrained]. The Los Angeles Kings and the 
California Sports, Inc., have argued valiantly, but unpersuasively, that to deny them [a player's] services will damage their 
franchise, that the team will be less proficient, that their record as a team and their reputation in the community will be seriously 
damaged and that they have already lost the sale of a large number of season tickets. . . . Defendants may not recover for their 
inability or their refusal to renew [a player's] contract through the operation of a provision that violates the antitrust law. Any 
injury that [a team] may suffer could have been avoided by exercising a greater effort to retain the services of [a player]."
609,460," F. Supp. at 912, vacated on other grounds, 600 F.2d 1193 (6th Cir. 1979). "
610,12," The Norris-LaGuardia Act also prohibits the enjoining of various enumerated activities, none of which are at issue in the 
present case. See 29 U.S.C. § 104; H.A. Artists & Assoc., Inc. v. Actors' Equity Ass'n, 451 U.S. 704, 714, 68 L. Ed. 2d 558, 101

engaged in enumerated activities"") (emphasis added); I Phillip Areeda & Donald F. Turner, Antitrust Law P229b, at 191 (1978) 
(Act protects those activities ""which employees and unions conduct unilaterally in pursuit of their goals""). "
611,13," For example, the players: have . . . paid a price for the loss of their collective bargaining representative because the NFL defendants have unilaterally 
changed insurance benefits and lengthened the [football] season . . . Powell and McNeil, 764 F. Supp. at 1359 (discussing motion in McNeil)."
611,14," The court further finds that defendants' reliance on Milk Wagon Drivers' Union, Local No. 753 v. Lake Valley Farm Prod., Inc., 
311 U.S. 91, 85 L. Ed. 63, 61 S. Ct. 122 (1940), is misplaced. In Milk Wagon, the Supreme Court held that HN13[
] federal 
courts do not have jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief merely because the parties allege violations of the Sherman Act. Id. at 
103 (no exception recognized ""merely because alleged violations of the Sherman Act are involved"" because such an exception 
would undermine the labor policies protected by the Norris-LaGuardia Act). In the present case, plaintiffs seek to rely on a prior 
decision that established a violation of the Sherman Act, and thus constitutes much more than a mere allegation of such 
illegality. Moreover, the Supreme Court has recognized that the Norris-LaGuardia Act does not preclude injunctive relief for 
certain antitrust challenges, such as a situation where a union has conspired with a non-labor group, like an employer or other 
business group, to violate the Sherman Act. See, e.g., Los Angeles Meat & Provision Drivers Union, 371 U.S. at 99-100 (it is 
""beyond question that HN14[
] nothing in the anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act . . . insulates a combination 
in illegal restraint of trade between businessmen and a labor union from the sanctions of the antitrust laws"", citing Allen Bradley 
Co., 325 U.S. at 809). If the Act does not provide a statutory exemption for a conspiracy between a labor union and an employer 
to violate the antitrust laws, it is difficult to understand why the Act would insulate such a conspiracy between employers."
611,15," The Powell litigation involved ""a class action challenging player restraints as far back as 1987, including allegations of abuse 
of monopoly power under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, a challenged to the uniform player contract"" and the Right of First

be per se illegal under Section 1 of the Sherman Act) with A.B. Lipsky, Current Antitrust Division Views on Patent Licensing

624,6," In Keeler the Court stated that ""whether a patentee may protect himself and his assignees by special contracts brought home 
to the purchasers . . . would arise as a question of contract, and not as one under the inherent meaning and effect of the patent 
laws."" 157 U.S. at 666. The question of whether a license restriction is binding on the purchaser is indeed one of contract law. 
However, the remedy for breach of a binding license provision is not exclusively in contract, for a license is simply a promise not 
to sue for what would otherwise be patent infringement. Fromson v. Western Litho Plate and Supply Co., 853 F.2d 1568, 1572, 7

invention ""without authority""). The district court stated that it intimated no opinion as to whether Mallinckrodt might enforce the restriction on ""contract law or 
property law"" or on ""equitable grounds"". We agree that a patentee may choose among alternate remedies, but to deny a 
patentee access to statutory remedies is to withhold the protection of the law. Thus whether Mallinckrodt may also have a 
remedy outside of the patent law is not before us."

656,10," KLM argues that the wholesale/retail dichotomy espoused by Amber is totally inappropriate in this case and is grossly 
misleading. KLM points out that a typical use of the terms wholesale and retail is found in a supermarket situation. A supplier 
(farmer or producer), sells to a wholesaler; the wholesaler then wholesales the product to a retailer (grocery store) which then "
657,," retails the product to the public. Each level of the market, from the supplier on down, adds its own level of profit. Each separate 
level of the market provides certain value added service(s) which forms the basis of its profit. KLM contends that this analysis is 
not applicable here because in this case, the remail product, is available directly to all potential consumers, whether they are 
consolidators such as Amber or individual ultimate end-users. This court agrees with KLM's argument to a degree, but despite 
the fact that KLM does sell directly to the ultimate end-user, the undisputed facts reveal that there is a retail market for 
international remail services. "

judgment or only that portion of the motion to dismiss concerning state action immunity, for which materials beyond the 
pleadings had been submitted. The implication of this distinction is that plaintiffs' response to the converted motion for summary 
judgment only provides evidence beyond the pleadings on the state action immunity issue, while standing on the pleadings with 
regard to the sufficiency of each cause of action. PP&L, on the other hand, seeks application of the summary judgment standard 
enunciated in Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-24 (1986)(requiring parties responding to a motion for summary 
judgment to go beyond the pleadings to show that there is a genuine issue for trial), to each of plaintiffs' claims. Because I will

authority to evaluate the prudence and cost-effectiveness of ""load management"" programs. 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 1319(a). 
With such broad power to implement both the language and intent of the Code, the PUC's construction of the Code will be given

673,12," The PUC's own policy statements may have stimulated the legislature to enact section 524 in the first place, which became 
effective July 10, 1986. In 1982, the PUC published a proposed policy statement of conservation and load management, 
suggesting that Pennsylvania electric utilities consider, inter alia, ""joint customer/company financing programs for residential and 
small commercial customers . . . [and] rate induced or company controlled load management programs."" 12 Pa. Bull. 3698 (Oct. 
9, 1982). In 1983, the PUC formally adopted this policy statement, finding authority ""to mandate the implementation of 
conservation and load management programs"" from the Code's broad conferral of power upon the PUC. 13 Pa. Bull. 3222, 3223 
(Oct. 22, 1983). This authority to mandate conservation and load management programs was subsequently called into question 
by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in June 1986 in Process Gas Consumers Group v. Pennsylvania Pub. Util. Comm'n, 511 
Pa. 88, 511 A.2d 1315 (1986). However, with the enactment of section 524 in July 1986, the Pennsylvania legislature expressly 
invested the PUC with the authority to ""order"" electric utilities to establish conservation and load management programs ""that the

674,17," Plaintiffs present no evidence whatsoever that PP &L's programs do not have at least some load shifting effect. Plaintiffs' 
evidence consists entirely of documents suggesting that PP &L's programs may not be cost-effective and may have a coincident 
effect of increasing load and PP &L's share of the home heating market. At best, this evidence goes only to the question of how 
well PP &L's programs serve the state policy, which does not bear on whether the state policy permits the programs in the first 
place. The former question is one for the state, not this Court, to address. Cf. Town of Hallie, 471 U.S. at 44 n.7 (Federal courts 
are not required to ""embroil"" themselves in unnecessary interpretation of state statutes, which would undercut fundamental 
policy of federalism and state sovereignty in Parker.); Ticor II, 112 S. Ct. at 2177 (The second prong Midcal inquiry ""is not to 
determine whether the State has met some normative standard, such as efficiency, in its regulatory practices.""). Whether the 
state has conducted an evaluation of PP &L's programs will be addressed when I turn to Midcal's second prong. "
675,18," I also note that the teachings of Cantor have been called into question by Midcal's progeny. See, e.g., Southern Motor Rate 
Carriers, 471 U.S. at 57 n.21 (criticizing ""questionable dictum"" of Cantor). Also consider the Court's rejection in Southern Motor 
Carriers of the Cantor notion that Parker does not immunize private conduct from antitrust liability. Compare Southern Motors 
Carriers, 471 U.S. at 61 with Cantor, 428 U.S. 590-92. See also Metro Mobile CTS Inc. v. Newvector Communications, Inc., 661

676,19," Authority for the PUC to adjudicate complaints against public utilities within its jurisdiction flows from 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann.

procedure for handling formal complaints is set forth at 56 Pa. Code. § 5.21 et seq. The Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania 
has recognized the authority of the PUC to adjudicate complaints against public utilities within its jurisdiction of alleged anti-
competitive conduct. See Executone of Philadelphia, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Pub. Util. Comm'n, 52 Pa. Commw. 74, 415 A.2d 445 
(1980). "
677,20," As of this date, there is no indication that the PUC has formally adopted these regulations."
677,21," I note in passing ""the close relationship between Midcal's two elements,"" identified by the Supreme Court in Ticor II, 112 S. 
Ct. at 2178. In this case, the first prong Midcal determination of whether Pennsylvania's load management policy contemplates 
programs such as PP &L's required consideration of the PUC's views on the relationship of those programs to the state policy. 
Under the second prong, the PUC's views on this relationship must be referred to again to determine whether the programs have 
been actively supervised."
677,22," Plaintiffs' argument rests upon 52 Pa. Code § 1.96, which states that the opinion of employees and representatives of the 
PUC are only considered as aids to the public and do not have the force and effect of law. . "

cable service over a cable television system and directly or through one or more affiliates owns a significant interest in such 
cable system, or who otherwise controls or is responsible for, through any arrangement, the management or operation of such a 
cable system. 'Cable television distributor' or 'cable television program supplier' means any person or group of persons that leases, licenses or 
sells program material or program services used in the provision of cable television service by a cable television exhibitor. 'Grantee' is a holder of a cable television franchise issued by the City of Montgomery.

equivalent to copyright and that extend to works coming within the scope of the federal copyright law. The declaration of this 
principle in section 301 is intended to be stated in the clearest and most unequivocal way possible, so as to foreclose any 
possible misinterpretation of its unqualified intention that Congress should act preemptively, and to avoid the development of any 
vague borderline area as between State and Federal protection."" Crow v. Wainwright, 720 F.2d 1224, 1225 (11th cir. 1983) (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 94-1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 130 (1976),

707,9," For example, in reversing a lower court's use of ""implied"" preemption analysis when the federal act included express 
preemption language, the Supreme Court stated that: ""When Congress has considered the issue of pre-emption and has included in the enacted legislation a provision explicitly 
addressing that issue, and when that provision provides a reliable indicium of congressional intent with respect to state

Court wrote that: ""if the Government has granted the seller a patent or similar monopoly over a product, it is fair to presume that the inability to 
buy the product elsewhere gives the seller market power. . . . Any effort to enlarge the scope of the patent monopoly by using 
the market power it confers to restrain competition in the market for a second product will undermine competition on the merits in

he will do business and with whom he will not do business; such action generally does not violate the antitrust laws. Thus, the

receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers or either of them: Provided, that nothing herein contained shall

market by the exclusive deal. . . . When the sellers of services are numerous and mobile, and the number of buyers is large, 
exclusive-dealing arrangements of narrow scope pose no threat of adverse economic consequences. To the contrary, they may 
be substantially pro-competitive by ensuring stable markets and encouraging long-term, mutually advantageous business

Circuit has stated that: ""This sort of arrangement, referred to as 'exclusive dealing,' does not give rise to antitrust liability without proof of actual 
competitive injury. Implicit in the freedom to deal exclusively with one merchant, of course, is the freedom to refuse to deal with a

713,17," In this respect, § 7 differs substantially from 15 U.S.C.A. § 13(b). Section § 13(b) does not have the effect of shifting the 
burden of an essential element of the plaintiff's case upon the defendant. It serves only to make the defenses of cost justification 
and ""meeting competition"" affirmative defenses to a claim of price discrimination. Texaco, Inc. v. Hasbrouck Wash., 496 U.S.

involved an analogous scenario. The case concerned an unusual challenge to a New Jersey law which prohibited discrimination 
in places of public accommodation. The national Kiwanis organization filed suit against its New Jersey chapter when the local 
chapter, in seeking to comply with the New Jersey law, admitted women in violation of the Kiwanis national constitution. The 
national organization sought to revoke the local's license to use the organization's trademarks on the grounds that the local had 
forfeited its license by breaching the Kiwanis charter. The national organization argued that the Lanham Act would not permit 
New Jersey law to be applied in such a way as to force the organization to license its trademark against its wishes. The district 
court disagreed. It held that in light of New Jersey's anti-discrimination laws, the plaintiff would not be permitted to withdraw its 
trademark, and further held that the Lanham Act did not preempt such an application of state law. The court reasoned that the 
local chapter would be, under state law, a genuine Kiwanis chapter, and thus that the Lanham Act would not be offended by the 
local's use of the Kiwanis mark, albeit without the national's ""consent."" 627 F. Supp. at 1391-92. The Third Circuit Court of 
Appeals reversed on the ground that the local chapter was not a ""place of public accommodation"" as defined by the New Jersey 
statute and thus was not subject to the anti-discrimination law. 806 F.2d at 477. However, relying on Mariniello, the appellate 
court noted that it agreed with the district court's preemption analysis under the Lanham Act. 806 F.2d at 472 n. 8. "

means or device, or to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, class of

717,22," Similarly, under the antitrust laws, prohibited price discrimination means the charging of different prices to different customers

discrimination is ""merely a price difference"" and is prohibited if not justified by cost or competitive factors)."
717,23," The defendants implore this court to extend P 543(f)'s coverage to local ""anti-discrimination"" ordinances as they apply to all 
cable services, not just basic cable service. Apparently, they fear that the plaintiffs will employ discriminatory practices in the 
provision of non-basic cable services. This the court cannot do, as the act's language is unmistakably clear on this point. "
719,24," As a final argument on this point, the plaintiffs contend that United Video applies to FCC regulations only, and local 
ordinances should be analyzed differently. This argument is meritless. Subsection (f) applies, by its own terms, equally to ""Any 
Federal agency, State, or franchising authority."" The relevant issue before the court in United Video was whether the challenged 
regulation was a ""requirement regarding the provision or content of cable services."" If the FCC rule was not such a 
""requirement,"" it is difficult to envision why a similar local regulation would be."

invalidated on first amendment grounds New York's ""Son of Sam"" law, which required income from works describing the author's 
crimes to be placed in a victims' fund. The statute was treated as a content based tax, analogous to the taxation scheme struck 
down in Arkansas Writers' Project, because it ""imposes a financial burden on speakers because of the content of their speech.""

at issue in those cases, Ordinance 48-90 is not a law of general applicability but applies only to the cable industry. However, this 
is nothing more than a re-argument that the ordinance impermissibly ""singles out"" the media. Because the court has found 
nothing constitutionally suspect in the fact that Ordinance 48-90 applies only to cable television, there is no basis for the 
argument that the ordinance falls outside the line of cases which hold that the communications media are subject to content-
neutral trade regulation. "

agreements which restrain trade, the ordinance may not apply to the plaintiffs' agreements at all. However, the defendants' 
position is not altogether genuine. Their counterclaim specifically alleges that these agreements violate Ordinance 48-90. 
Additionally, they cannot dispute that the existence of these particular licenses is what prompted the enactment of Ordinance 48-

748,13," We disagree with Banks' allegation in paragraph 22(c) of his Amended Complaint that the NCAA no-draft and no-agent Rules 
give the college player only one realistic chance of being drafted in the NFL because the college player (1) can enter the draft

eligibility); (2) enter the draft, then play for another league like the CFL, WFL, or ARENA or even sit out for a year and then 
reenter the draft (Bo Jackson was a first round draft choice of Tampa Bay, but he chose to play baseball instead, the next year 
he was drafted by the Los Angeles Raiders with whom he signed); or (3) complete his eligibility before entering the draft. Recently 97 of the 107 NCAA Division 1-A football programs imposed strict guidelines on NFL scouts to prevent plucking

impact, rather he broadly concludes ""the Rules operate as a restraint on all members of the NCAA . . . ."" Amended Complaint P 
22(b). "
752,*," At the outset of its analysis, the panel charges that, on appeal, Banks ""ignored"" the district court's holding that he failed to 
allege an anticompetitive impact upon an identifiable market. See Op. at 10. This charge, I suggest, is mistaken. The portion of 
Banks' brief quoted by the panel refers to two rulings entered by the district court. The first denies Banks' motion for a 
preliminary injunction against the NCAA to restore his eligibility--he was declared ineligible pursuant to the no-draft and no-agent 
rules--to play football for Notre Dame during his final year there.  Banks v. National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 746 F. Supp. 850 
(N.D. Ind. 1990) [""Banks I""]. Banks did not appeal this ruling. Instead, he filed an amended complaint seeking a permanent 
injunction on behalf of a class of players (not including himself) against enforcement of the rules, and damages resulting from his 
ineligibility. The district court's dismissal of the amended complaint, Banks v. National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, No. S90-394 
(N.D. Ind. Feb. 20, 1991) [""Banks II""], is the second ruling, and the one at issue in this appeal. Banks' characterization in his brief 
of these two rulings is right on the money. Banks I found that he had ""posited a credible anti-competitive effect"" of the no-draft 
and no-agent rules, Banks I, 746 F. Supp. at 860, but nonetheless denied his motion for a preliminary injunction on the ground 
that the rules' procompetitive effects outweighed any anticompetitive effects under the rule of reason. Id. at 860-62. Banks II (the 
""subsequent opinion"" to which Banks refers in his brief) shifted gears by dismissing Banks' amended complaint on the ground 
that it did not allege any anticompetitive effects. Banks II, slip op. at 11. The court did not, however, really explain its change of 
heart. Contrary to the panel's contentions, Banks did assign error to the holding of Banks II. See Pl.'s Br. at 21-27 (contending 
that Banks has alleged anticompetitive effects). Any confusion arises from the fact that Banks was compelled to address the 
arguments presented in the NCAA's brief below because Banks II's analysis of this issue was so thin.  [*1095] The parties agree that Banks, to survive the NCAA's motion to dismiss, must define a relevant market and allege how the 
challenged rules adversely affect competition in that market.  Lektro-Vend Corp. v. Vendo Co., 660 F.2d 255, 268 (7th Cir. 
1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 921 (1982). As the NCAA concedes, Banks defined two markets in his complaint, only one of 
which it is necessary to address here: the nationwide labor market for college football players. See Amended Complaint P 22(a)-
(b). NCAA member colleges are the purchasers of labor in this market, and the players are the suppliers. The players agree to "
753,," compete in football games sponsored by the colleges, games that typically garner the colleges a profit, in exchange for tuition, 
room, board and other benefits. Banks also alleges how the NCAA rules at issue--I will focus upon the no-draft rule--harm competition in that market: they 
foreclose players ""from choosing a major college football team based on the willingness of the institution to waive or change [the] 
rule[]."" Id. P 22(b). It is hardly a revelation that colleges fiercely compete for the most promising high school football players--the 
players who, incidentally, are most likely to feel constrained by the challenged rules two or three years down the line. If the no-
draft rule were scuttled, colleges that promised their athletes the opportunity to test the waters in the NFL draft before their 
eligibility expired, and return if things didn't work out, would be more attractive to athletes than colleges that declined to offer the 
same opportunity. The no-draft rule eliminates this potential element of competition among colleges, the purchasers of labor in 
the college football labor market. It categorically rules out a term of employment that players, the suppliers of labor in that 
market, would find advantageous. Cf.  FTC v. Indiana Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 459 (1986) (considering ""a horizontal 
agreement among . . . dentists to withhold from their customers a particular service that they desire""). It is well settled that an agreement among employers to control a material term of employment harms competition in the labor 
market at issue.  Radovich v. National Football League, 352 U.S. 445 (1957); Nichols v. Spencer Int'l Press, Inc., 371 F.2d 
332, 335-36 (7th Cir. 1967); Phillip Areeda and Donald F. Turner, II Antitrust Law P 338c, at 199-200 (1978); Annotation, 
Validity, Under the Federal Antitrust Laws (15 USC § 1 et seq.) of Agreements Between Employers or Employer Associations 
Imposing Restrictions on Employment, 2 A.L.R. Fed. 839 (1969 and 1991 Supp.) (citing cases); cf.  Ball Memorial Hosp., Inc. v. 
Mutual Hosp. Ins., Inc., 784 F.2d 1325, 1338 (7th Cir. 1986) (conspiracy among buyers to depress prices harmful to 
competition). It should come as no surprise that the no-draft rule operates to the detriment of the players, and that colleges 
benefit from the fact that their athletes feel tied to the institution for four years. Consider, for example, athletes who are known in 
the vernacular as ""bubble"" players. These athletes are excellent competitors at the collegiate level, but for various reasons are 
considered less than certain NFL prospects. Bubble players who wish to market their wares in the professional market after their 
sophomore or junior year will forego entry into the NFL draft because, if they are not selected (or fail to join a team after being 
selected), the rule will prevent them from returning to college to hone their skills and try again in subsequent years. See Note, 
Sherman Act Invalidation of the NCAA Amateurism Rules, 105 Harv. L. Rev. 1299, 1311 (1992). The rule permits colleges to 
squeeze out of their players one or two more years of service, years the colleges might have lost had the ability to enter the draft 
without consequence to eligibility been the subject of bargaining between athletes and colleges. See Rhoden, Smoke, Mirrors 
and Doubletalk From the N.C.A.A., N.Y. Times, Jan. 11, 1992, at 29. The rule thereby distorts  [*1096]  the ""price"" of labor in the 
college football labor market to the detriment of players. The NCAA disputes this characterization, maintaining that the no-draft rule is not ""anticompetitive"" as the term is employed 
under the Sherman Act. At the heart of its argument is the contention that ""there is no price competition as such among colleges 
for players because the 'price,' the value of grant-in-aid, is determined by the school's tuition, room, and board, not by the supply 
of and demand for players."" Def.'s Br. at 20. This analysis of the college football labor market is partially correct; in that market, 
players exchange their labor for in-kind benefits, not cash. At least ideally. But see Johnson, Defense Against the NCAA, U.S. 
News & World Rep., Jan. 13, 1992, at 25 (improper cash payments made to football players at Auburn University); Johnson, 
Playing for Pay in Texas, Newsweek, Mar. 16, 1987, at 32 (same at Southern Methodist University). It is unrealistic, however, to suggest that the value of those in-kind benefits is limited solely to tuition, room and board. If this 
were true, the best football players would attend the most expensive private universities that would admit them, for these 
universities would offer, under the NCAA's analysis, the most ""valuable"" compensation for their services. Assuming some 
regional loyalties, private colleges such as Syracuse University, the University of Southern California, and Notre Dame would 
consistently outrecruit public colleges such as Penn State, UCLA and the University of Michigan. As anyone familiar with college 
football well knows, this is not the case. The reason is simple. Athletes look to more than tuition, room and board when 
determining which college has offered them the most attractive package of in-kind benefits. Some athletes look primarily to the 
reputation of a particular program or coach as a ""feeder"" into the NFL; others believe that the quality of a university's academic 
program and the commitment of the coaching staff to scholarly pursuits is more important. Some athletes look to whether a 
college will offer them a cushy, high-paying job during the summer or school year; others might be attracted by state-of-the-art 
training facilities. And some athletes, if given the chance, would look to whether a college would allow them to enter the NFL 
draft and return if they did not join a professional team. All of these things--with the exception of the last item--are ""terms of employment"" that currently sweeten the pot for athletes 
choosing among college football programs. They provide, apart from tuition, room and board, the means by which colleges, as 
purchasers of labor, attract and compensate their players, the suppliers of labor. That the medium of exchange is non-monetary 
does not alter the fact that these benefits constitute the ""price"" of labor in the college football market, or that the categorical "
754,," elimination of one of those benefits harms competition in that market. The NCAA's protestations notwithstanding, there can be 
no doubt that Banks has alleged an anticompetitive effect in a relevant market. A couple of other matters regarding the confusing and often confused issue of ""antitrust injury"" warrant brief attention. The panel, 
as well as the district court, alludes to Banks' supposed failure to allege that the NCAA rules have caused him to suffer antitrust 
injury. See Op. at 10; Banks II, slip op. at 11. I respectfully suggest that Banks has satisfied this burden. Section 4 of the Clayton 
Act requires private plaintiffs seeking relief under the antitrust laws to demonstrate antitrust injury, Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo 
Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477 (1977); Local Beauty Supply, Inc. v. Lamaur, Inc., 787 F.2d 1197, 1200-02 (7th Cir. 1986), 
something necessary, though not sufficient, to establish antitrust standing.  Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 
104, 110 n.5 (1986); Southwest Suburban Bd. of Realtors, Inc. v. Beverly Area Planning Ass'n, 830 F.2d 1374, 1377 (7th Cir. 
1987). Banks cannot clear this threshold merely by showing that his injury is causally linked to the NCAA's alleged antitrust 
violation. Rather, he must also show that his injury is ""of the  [*1097]  type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that 
flows from that which makes [the NCAA rules] unlawful,"" Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 489, or, put another way, that his injury is 
attributable to the allegedly anticompetitive aspect of those rules.  Cargill, 479 U.S. at 109-110. The requirement, in short, 
compels him ""to connect the injury claimed to the purposes of the antitrust laws."" Areeda and Turner, VIII Antitrust Law, supra, 
P 1640c, at 444. Banks easily clears this threshold. The no-draft rule, as noted, is anticompetitive because it constitutes an agreement among 
colleges to eliminate an element of competition in the college football labor market. The purposes of the antitrust laws are served 
when employers are prevented from tampering with the employment market in this precise way. ""Just as antitrust law seeks to 
preserve the free market opportunities of buyers and sellers of goods, so also it seeks to do the same for buyers and sellers of 
employment services . . . ."" Areeda and Turner, II Id. P 338c, at 199-200; see also Quinonez v. National Ass'n of Sec. Dealers, 
Inc., 540 F.2d 824, 828 (5th Cir. 1976). Banks' injury--namely, the revocation of his eligibility and consequent loss of his athletic 
scholarship during his final year at Notre Dame--""flows from"" the precise anticompetitive aspects of the NCAA rules that he set 
out in his complaint. Our discussion of antitrust injury in Bicham v. Chemetron Corp. (In re Industrial Gas Antitrust Litigation), 681 F.2d 514 (7th Cir. 
1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1016 (1983), confirms this conclusion. There, an executive terminated by a corporation charged 
that the corporation had participated in a horizontal conspiracy to fix prices, and that he had been fired and blacklisted for 
refusing to adhere to the conspiracy. We held that the executive had failed to demonstrate antitrust injury because the harm 
inflicted upon him by the corporation was not ""inextricably related to, and caused by"" the anticompetitive effect of the alleged 
price fixing activities in the product market.  Id. at 515. In so holding, we distinguished Radovich v. National Football League, 
supra, and Nichols v. Spencer Int'l Press, Inc., supra. Both of those cases, like Bicham, involved antitrust suits brought by 
employees against their employers, but, unlike Bicham, both considered alleged Sherman Act violations involving 
anticompetitive activities among employers in the labor market, not the product market. It follows, we observed, that the plaintiffs 
in Nichols and Radovich had demonstrated antitrust injury because ""the conspiracies in both cases were intended to restrict 
competitive conditions in the labor market, [and] the injuries complained of, restriction of employment alternatives, were directly 
related to the anticompetitive restraints."" Bicham, 681 F.2d at 517. Banks' complaint, which alleges restrictive competitive 
conditions in the relevant labor market, falls squarely within the rubric of Nichols and Radovich. See generally Frederick 
Woodbridge, Jr., Employee Standing in Private Antitrust Suits: A New Element in the Balance, 51 U. Cin. L. Rev. 878 (1982). The NCAA also raises the issue of harm to consumers; it contends that Banks' complaint is deficient because it does not 
""reasonably support the inference that consumers are harmed by the operation of the no-draft and no-agent rules."" Def.'s Br. at 
23. Whether harm to consumers is the sine qua non of antitrust injury is an issue over which there is currently a split in this 
circuit. Some of our cases hold that a plaintiff, to satisfy the antitrust injury requirement, must demonstrate that the challenged 
practice causing him harm also harms consumers by reducing output or raising prices.  Stamatakis Indus., Inc. v. King, 965 F.2d 
469, 471 (7th Cir. 1992); Chicago Professional Sports Ltd. Partnership v. National Basketball Ass'n, 961 F.2d 667, 670 (7th Cir. 
1992). Others hold that application of the antitrust laws ""does not depend in each particular case upon the ultimate demonstrable 
consumer effect."" Fishman v. Estate of Wirtz, 807 F.2d 520, 536 (7th Cir. 1986); see also Chicago Professional Sports, 961 F.2d 
at 677 (Cudahy, J., concurring).  [*1098] One can dispense with the NCAA's contention without choosing sides in this dispute. To see why, it is important first to identify 
the consumers and the market at issue in this case. By ""consumers,"" the NCAA apparently means people who watch college 
football. These individuals certainly are consumers in the college football product market, but the market at issue here is the 
college football labor market, and the NCAA member colleges are consumers in that market. It would be counterintuitive to 
require Banks to demonstrate that the no-draft and no-agent rules harm the colleges, the very entities that established those "
755,," rules. I doubt very strongly that the rule laid out in Chicago Professional Sports, to the extent it is valid elsewhere, was intended 
to apply in this context. Concerted action among consumers that lowers prices harms competition as much as concerted action 
among producers that raises prices. The distinction should be irrelevant to any discussion of antitrust injury. See Ball Memorial 
Hosp., 784 F.2d at 1338. Professors Areeda and Turner, when discussing the right of laborers to challenge antitrust violations in 
the labor market, put things nicely: It would be perverse . . . to hold that the very object of the law's solicitude and the persons most directly concerned--perhaps the 
only persons concerned--could not challenge the restraint. . . . The standing of such plaintiffs is undoubted and seldom 
challenged. Areeda & Turner, II Antitrust Law, supra, P 338c, at 200; see also Phillip Areeda & Louis Kaplow, Antitrust Analysis P 148(c), at 
90 (4th ed. 1988). Banks has alleged that the NCAA rules harm competition to the detriment of producers in the college football 
labor market, and that his injuries are directly related to that harm. This is sufficient to establish ""antitrust injury"" in this context. 
See Bicham, 681 F.2d at 517 (discussing Radovich and Nichols). I add here a caveat to avert any potential misunderstandings. My point is only that Banks has properly alleged an anticompetitive 
effect in a relevant market and has demonstrated antitrust injury, and hence that his damages action should survive the NCAA's 
motion to dismiss. But this is, of course, only the first step. To ultimately prevail, Banks also must demonstrate, under the rule of 
reason, that the no-agent and no-draft rules, despite their anticompetitive effects, are not ""justifiable means of fostering 
competition among amateur athletic teams and therefore procompetitive"" on the whole.  Board of Regents, 468 U.S. at 117. It 
may very well be that the no-draft and no-agent rules are essential to the survival of college football as a distinct and viable 
product, in which case Banks would lose. A lively debate has arisen among those who have already considered this matter. 
Compare Gaines v. National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 746 F. Supp. 738, 746-47 (M.D. Tenn. 1990) (NCAA rules survive rule of 
reason analysis) and Banks I, 746 F. Supp. at 860-62 (same) with Note, NCAA Amateurism Rules, supra, at 1309-12 (would find 
NCAA rules invalid under rule of reason). I opt not to join the fray here, for I think it unwise to weigh pro- and anticompetitive 
effects under the rule of reason on a motion to dismiss. See Wilk v. American Medical Ass'n, 895 F.2d 352, 358 (7th Cir.), cert. 
denied, 496 U.S. 927 (1990) (rule of reason considers ""agreements whose competitive effect can only be evaluated by analyzing 
the facts peculiar to the business involved, the particular restraint's history, and the reasons it was imposed""). Today's decision, by holding that Banks has not alleged that the rules are anticompetitive in the first instance, deprives him of 
the opportunity to join this issue on remand. As I have discussed, it is difficult to reconcile this holding with a sound reading of 
Banks' complaint. On a broader level, I am also concerned that today's decision--unintentionally, to be sure, for it suggests that a 
""more artfully drafted complaint"" could have alleged an anticompetitive effect in this market--will provide comfort to the NCAA's 
incredulous assertion that its eligibility rules are ""noncommercial."" See Def.'s Br. at 20 n.10. The NCAA would have us believe 
that intercollegiate  [*1099]  athletic contests are about spirit, competition, camaraderie, sportsmanship, hard work (which they 
certainly are) . . . and nothing else. See NCAA Constitution, art. 3, § 1 (1986) (student-athlete is one ""who engages in a 
particular sport for the educational, physical, mental and social benefits he derives therefrom and to whom participation in that 
sport is an avocation""). Players play for the fun of it, colleges get a kick out of entertaining the student body and alumni, but the 
relationship between players and colleges is positively noncommercial. See Sharon Elizabeth Rush, Touchdowns, Toddlers, and 
Taboos: On Paying College Athletes and Surrogate Contract Mothers, 31 Ariz. L. Rev. 549, 576-77, 581-82, 587-88 (1989) 
(discussing images of intercollegiate sports); Arthur D. Austin, Book Review, 58 N. Car. L. Rev. 660, 663 (1980) (discussing 
contemporary myth which portrays student-athletes ""as students, who, in the off hours away from dedication to the books, 
happen to participate in organized sports""). It is consoling to buy into these myths, for they remind us of a more innocent era--an 
era where recruiting scandals were virtually unknown, where amateurism was more a reality than an ideal, and where post-
season bowl games were named for commodities, not corporations. See House: Don't Tax Bowls' Sponsors, Chi. Daily L. Bull., 
July 29, 1992, at 1 (House of Representatives votes to block Internal Revenue Service from taxing Mobil Cotton Bowl on the 
approximately $ 1.5 million a year it receives from Mobil). On the flip side, it is disquieting to think of college football as a 
business, of colleges as the purchasers of labor, and of athletes as the suppliers. The NCAA continues to purvey, even in this case, an outmoded image of intercollegiate sports that no longer jibes with reality. 
The times have changed. College football is a terrific American institution that generates abundant nonpecuniary benefits for 
players and fans, but it is also a vast commercial venture that yields substantial profits for colleges, see, e.g., Board of Regents, 
468 U.S. at 92-94; National Collegiate Athletic Association, Revenues and Expenses of Intercollegiate Athletic Programs 15 
(1990) (estimating that sports revenues at Division IA schools exceeds one billion dollars per year); D. Devenzio, Rip Off U: The 
Annual Theft and Exploitation of Major College Revenue-Producing Athletes 106-08 (1986) (University of Michigan football 
program posted a $ 2 million profit in 1984); Arthur D. Austin, The Legality of Ticket Tie-Ins in Intercollegiate Athletics, 15 U. 
Rich. L. Rev. 1, 1 (1980), both on and off the field. See, e.g., Lee Goldman, Sports and Antitrust: Should College Students Be "
756,," Paid to Play?, 65 Notre Dame L. Rev. 206, 206 (1990); Rush, Touchdowns, Toddlers, and Taboos, supra, at 553, 570; It Pays to 
Win . . . Or to Lose, N.Y. Times, June 8, 1986, § 5, at 8 (during time Heisman Trophy winner Bo Jackson played football for 
Auburn University, annual applications increased from 4500 to 6200); Clark, The Business of Education: Does Athletics Help or 
Hurt?, Wall St. J., Aug. 26, 1985, at 25 (athletic success of Clemson University increased average amount of alumni donations). 
The games provide fans with entertaining contests to watch, and athletes with an opportunity to display and develop their 
strength, skills and character, but they are saleable products nonetheless.  Board of Regents, supra. An athlete's participation 
offers all of the rewards that attend vigorous competition in organized sport, but it is also labor, labor for which the athlete is 
recompensed. The no-draft and no-agent rules may, ultimately, pass muster under the rule of reason. But, putting the adequacy 
of Banks' complaint to the side, contending that they have no commercial effect on competition in the college football labor 
market, or that there is no market of that type at all, is chimerical: The true stake is this decades-long gentleman's agreement between the NFL and the college powers-that-be that has kept all 
but a handful of football playing collegians from turning pro before their four-year use to their schools is exhausted. The pros get 
a free farm system that supplies them with well-trained, much publicized employees. The colleges  [*1100]  get to keep their 
players the equivalent of barefoot and pregnant. Klein, College Football: Keeping 'em Barefoot, Wall St. J., Sept. 4, 1987, at 15. When confronted with the clash between soothing nostalgia and distressing reality, it is oftentimes difficult to resist the call of 
tennis champion Andre Agassi, who when hawking cameras off the court tells us that ""image is everything."" But we must 
remember that Agassi's domain, at least in this instance, is television. What may be true there is decidedly not under the lens of 
the antitrust laws. See National Soc'y of Professional Eng'rs v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 696 (1978); Goldfarb v. Virginia 
State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 786-88 (1975). Having found that Banks has cleared the threshold of alleging an anticompetitive effect 
in a relevant market, I would reverse the district court's dismissal of his damages action and remand for further proceedings. "

772,7," The General Accounting Office, at the behest of the Senate Agriculture Committee, investigated the CBOT's adoption and

773,8," Along similar lines, the CBOT argues that CEA § 22, 7 U.S.C. § 25, impliedly repeals antitrust actions brought by those 
individuals whose injuries do not arise from their trading on a futures exchange. As we observed when discussing implied 
preemption, however, that provision, by its terms, excludes non-traders from recovery under the CEA, but not under other 
federal or state laws. See p. 10 supra."
773,9," Alternatively, the CBOT could argue that its action was compelled by a statute or regulation, namely CEA § 5(d), 7 U.S.C. § 
7(d), which requires it to enforce rules to ensure fair trading and CEA § 5a(12), 7 U.S.C. § 7a(12), which authorizes it to invoke 
emergency resolutions to prevent market disruption due to a threatened market cornering. This, however, is the essence of the 
suit: was the CBOT action taken pursuant to the statute and regulations, making it unassailable by the AAM, or was the 
emergency resolution adopted in bad faith, not to prevent market disruption but to further private interests, and therefore outside 
the statutory authority and open to Sherman Act liability? If the CBOT acted in bad faith and thus outside the scope of its 
statutory authority, it will not enjoy immunity from the Sherman Act. Whether this particular resolution fits within the parameters 
of action compelled by statute or regulation, immunizing it from antitrust liability, requires a factual determination which cannot 
be made on this record. This issue was not addressed by the district court and remains open on remand. "

820,8, The district court merged the state law antitrust claims with the Sherman Act claims. 
822,9," Paragraph 28 of the Complaint, falling under a section entitled ""Count I"" (the section one antitrust claim) provides: [as a result of Armstrong's conduct], plaintiff Fineman's reputation as a management consultant, in fact one of the leading 
management consultants in the floor covering industry, was severely damaged. He was thus eliminated as a credible force in 
assisting distributors to reduce their inventory levels, thus permitting Armstrong to sell to its distributors more inventory than they 
actually needed. It is extremely damaging to a management consultant to have suffered an insolvency, given the nature of such 
a profession. Confidence in such a person is lost if it is known that the consultant's own business went under. In addition the pretrial statement includes in the plaintiffs' statement of legal issues the following: ""Plaintiff Fineman is entitled to 
an award of lost earnings or profits from his consulting business."" J.A. at 780. The district court ruled that both the Complaint and 
pretrial statement adequately averred Fineman's individual tortious interference claim. J.A. at 6827."
822,10," Armstrong's counsel prefaced this statement of the issues with an assertion that he had ""nothing really to add that's not in our 
brief."" A search of the docket sheet in the district court reveals that this document was not filed with the Clerk's office and 
therefore does not appear of record. For that reason we have before us only the oral statement of the two grounds for directed 
verdict. "
825,11," The plaintiffs also assert on appeal that the district court erred in resolving the issue of the application of the Connecticut Act 
because of the invited errordoctrine involving Armstrong's proposed jury instructions. We find that because Armstrong had 
consistently contended that the Connecticut Act barred any claim for tortious interference, this legal issue was consistently 
preserved. Thus we decline to address the invited error doctrine in this instance. In any case, because the Connecticut Act issue 
is likely to arise during a new trial, we will address it now."

alleged inconsistencies in defense witnesses' depositions and trial testimony to counsel's coaching; we note that he caused the

this lawsuit and the ""probability of a multimillion dollar plaintiffs' verdict"" because he believed Armstrong and its lawyers had 
improperly failed to disclose this information. "
828,15," This figure comports with Abrahamson's testimony that he expected to recoup the cost of the distributor fee of $ 16,000 within 
six months. J.A. at 4290. Although $ 29,000 was promised to Abrahamson, the record is cloudy as to how Fineman made the 
calculation. As will be detailed in some length in Part V.B. when we deal with the district court's grant of a new trial for the reason 
that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, the record evidence casts doubt upon this rosy projection of $ 29,000. 
For example, charter distributors who had signed on before the settlement agreement received royalties of $ 8 per videotape 
sold. However, this royalty had been reduced to $ 5 by the time TINS was offered to Stern. J.A. at 2513. Fineman also testified 
that he estimated Stern would sell 200 subscriptions and Abrahamson more optimistically calculated 300. The $ 29,000 in 
promised royalties, however, appears to be rounded up from ($ 8/videotape) (12 months) (300 subscribers) = $ 28,800. J.A. at 
2515. Fineman was not able to account for this discrepancy. Moreover, Fineman conceded that TINS distributors' salesmen had 
each averaged 11 subscriptions prior to the solicitation of Stern. Thus, given Stern's sales force of 13, a more reliable estimate 
of potential subscriptions might have been 143 rather than Fineman's 200, see J.A. at 2517, resulting in annual royalties of $ 
8,580 or ($ 5) (12 months) (143 subscribers). "
830,16," TINS suggests that ""this restaurant story was simply concocted by Abrahamson both to reinforce his claim that the sales force 
opposed the program, and to distance himself from responsibility."" Appellants' Brief at 16. A Stern employee, McGuire testified 
that he did not see Abrahamson at the restaurant at any time, J.A. at 5362, although there is evidence that the layout of the 
restaurant in several small rooms could account for this inconsistency. "
831,17," The parties have not suggested, nor have we been able to find, any New Jersey cases addressing a claim for tortious 
interference brought by a plaintiff who was not a party to the contract. Assuming without deciding that New Jersey would permit 
such a claim, we must determine whether this record supports Fineman's individual claim. "
835,18," If this proposition were true, Armstrong's possession of a 21% market share in hard surface floor covering products would, as 
a matter of law, defeat TINS' section 2 claims.  J.A. at 5956. See Domed Stadium Hotel, Inc. v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 732 F.2d 480, 
489 (5th Cir. 1984). "
836,19," In so finding, we have combed the substantial trial transcript and concluded that it supports the jury's verdict in this respect. 
Thus we have not needed to view the actual videotapes and video disks supplied by the parties."
836,20," At trial, Armstrong advanced the theory that its video network did not differ from selling aids provided in different media forms. 
TINS produced sufficient evidence from which the jury may have reasonably concluded that the video medium was not 
reasonably interchangeable with print. See, e.g., J.A. at 1633 (Fineman testified that a picture is worth a thousand words); 2917 
(Al Wahnon, publisher of Floor Covering News, explained that print magazines were ""faster breaking"" than video magazines). "
838,21, The resilient industry referred to in this opinion encompasses both sheeting and tile forms of vinyl floor coverings. 
839,22," TINS alluded to evidence that Hal Clark's supermarket industry video magazine start-up costs of $ 1.5 million proved a 
formidable barrier to entry. By Clark's own testimony, however, his ""Supermarket Insights"" differed significantly from TINS or 
Armstrong's videos. Clark's was gratuitously provided to a limited number of top industry executives and financed through paid 
advertising. TINS' revenue came from entirely different sources, i.e., subscribers, and its target audience was widely-based. "
840,23," Danny Kresky involved the use of monopoly leveraging in one city to exclude a competitor from promoting concerts in 
another. SmithKline involved monopoly leveraging over sales of antibiotics to set prices in the cephalosporin drug market for 
cephalosporin drugs at a level at which competitors in the leveraged market could not compete. Because the plaintiffs had 
proven conduct traditionally proscribed by the Sherman Act, neither case implicated the issue with which we are faced."
840,24," Section 1 proclaims that ""every contract, combination . . ., or conspiracy, in restraint of trade . . . is . . . illegal."" Section 2 
declares as illegal ""every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person 
or persons, to monopolize . . . ."" 15 U.S.C.A. §§ 1, 2 (West Supp. 1992). "
841,25," We note that because of our disposition of the Sherman Act section 2 claim on appeal, see supra Part IV, a new trial on 
remand would not include a section 2 claim. A new trial would, however, include a Sherman Act section 1 claim and a contract 
claim, discussed infra Part VI. "
842,26," Armstrong objected to plaintiffs' trial counsel's improper remarks by filing a motion in limine to limit his closing argument, 
moving for a restraining order, placing several objections on the record during his summation and moving for a mistrial following 
summation. J.A. at 6988; 7154; 7158-59; 7206. Although Armstrong's counsel did not object to each potentially improper remark, 
the district court concluded that it had adequately preserved its objections. J.A. at 229. The district court did not abuse its 
discretion in ruling that Armstrong was not required to object to each and every objectionable remark because requiring such 
action would have unnecessarily created even more prejudice to Armstrong in the eyes of the jury. "
843,27," These ""misrepresentations"" consisted of Armstrong's version of disputed material facts. A demonstrative aid shown to the jury 
listed ""[Defense Counsel's] Significant Misrepresentations In Summation."" J.A. at 1296-1303. These ""misrepresentations"" 
attributed to Armstrong and ""facts"" attributed to plaintiffs merely consisted of two versions of disputed factual issues. A brief 
excerpt demonstrates: MISREPRESENTATION FACTS"

847,28," One quote neatly capsulizes plaintiffs' trial counsel's summation in these respects. After recreating a question put to 
Armstrong witness Dennis Draeger concerning whether Roth's comments to Abrahamson ""[weren't] just a blatant, blatant, 
blatant disregard of what you were supposed to do?"", he argued, And God bless him, please, in front of a federal judge and I ask him that question. He's in front of a federal jury and he's got the 
nerve to say, no, it's not inconsistent. God bless him. He's got a lot of nerve. Can you imagine he's looking you in the eye? I mean, does he think you just got off the boat? Who does he think he is? Really. That is insulting. J.A. at 7050. "
848,29," In Ayoub, a personal injury case, we considered defense counsel's representation that the plaintiff's testimony was 
inconsistent with his medical history as contained in two sets of hospital records. One set of records was not submitted into 
evidence, although a doctor testified that in practice a medical history was based upon the patient's description. Thus, the effect 
of counsel's remark was to insinuate that Ayoub had given inconsistent statements about his medical condition. We ruled that 
""reversible error is committed when counsel's closing argument to the jury introduces extraneous matter which has a reasonable 
probability of influencing the verdict."" Id. at 170; see also Draper, 580 F.2d at 96 (in a wrongful death action, it was improper for 
plaintiff's counsel to speak of meeting with the decedent's children, who did not testify, and use that as an improper springboard 
to speculate as to the decedent's motivation for attempting the dangerous, and ultimately fatal, job). Even the district court's 
instruction, that the jury would have to ""recall the testimony about [the missing set of hospital records]"" did not suffice to cure the 
prejudice.  Ayoub, 550 F.2d at 170 & n.10. "
850,30," Armstrong primarily reiterates an insufficiency of the evidence challenge to TINS' theory of conspiracy. If this were borne out 
by the record, then Armstrong's evidence that Stern acted independently and in accordance with its own business interests 
would prevail to defeat any conspiracy motive or theory. However, for the reasons provided above in Part III, we reject 
Armstrong's formulation of the reasonable inferences that may be garnered from the trial record. TINS' proposition that distributing the TINS magazine would have been highly profitable to Stern by enabling Stern to 
supplement its income with subscription royalties is amply supported in the record as is the inference of motivation on Stern's 
part to enter the conspiracy, namely, Stern's heavy reliance upon Armstrong as the supplier of 90% of its product. In addition, 
TINS produced evidence to show that Stern was not achieving a desired level of profitability and Armstrong had encumbered 
Stern with inventory liens. Although Armstrong vigorously contested the existence of, or permissible interpretation of, each of 
these alleged facts, because we may not tread on the jury's credibility determination function, we must presume in reviewing this 
directed verdict that the jury would believe TINS' factual contentions."
850,31," Roth had testified that he perceived TINS would ""overlap"" with Armstrong's video program and ""probably"" had counseled 
Abrahamson that distributing TINS would not make ""a lot of sense."" See supra Part III.E. "
851,32," Armstrong inexplicably cites to a conscious parallelism case, Venzie Corp. v. United States Mineral Prod. Co., Inc., 521 F.2d 
1309, 1314 (3d Cir. 1975), for the proposition that our precedent requires that ""proof of an antitrust conspiracy must include the 
'satisfactory demonstration of a motivation to enter an agreement' reflecting the conspiracy."" Appellee's Brief at 53. In order to 
find evidence of concerted action in a parallel refusal to deal situation, we required: 1) action contrary to the co-conspirator's 
economic interest; and 2) a satisfactory demonstration of a motivation to enter an agreement as required in First Nat'l Bank v. 
Cities Serv. Co., 391 U.S. 253, 287, 20 L. Ed. 2d 569, 88 S. Ct. 1575 (1968). These requirements insulate from liability 
coincidental, as opposed to concerted, parallel refusal to deal cases. The case sub judice arises in an altogether different factual context. In this vertical matrix and given our standard of review, we 
find that the record is replete with evidence of Armstrong's motive and Stern's dependence upon Armstrong, should the jury 
choose to credit TINS' evidence. Thus we need not require the same checks against speculation in a vertical case as we do in a 
conscious parallelism case. As a factual matter as well, the evidence, if it is credited by the jury, suggests that Stern acted 
against its economic interest in reneging on distributing TINS. "
852,33," The plaintiffs also make mention of an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. As Armstrong points out, this allegation 
appears to have arisen initially upon appeal. Therefore we decline to address it. "
853,34," In pertinent part, this letter represented Armstrong's position with respect to TINS as follows: We believe that specialization of sales management and sales personnel is the most effective way for a wholesaler to compete 
in the resilient flooring business. Mr. Fineman has assured us that it would be unnecessary to use the specialized selling staff on an ongoing basis to service or 
further promote his program. On that basis, we have become convinced that Mr. Fineman's program would not adversely affect 
this specialization when your Armstrong specialized selling force is used only for the initial presentations of TINS to potential 
TINS retail subscribers with a minimal time commitment of your selling force thereafter. Therefore, based upon Mr. Fineman's assurances, we advise you that Armstrong does not object to any Armstrong wholesaler 
utilizing the TINS program. You have my personal assurance, [insert name of addressee], that whatever independent business 
decision you make regarding the TINS program will not in any manner affect our goal of working together as a team. It is not the policy of Armstrong to express any opinions on products other than their own and, therefore, Armstrong expresses 
no opinion for or against the use of TINS. J.A. at 7772-73."
853,35," This letter reads: Dear Mr. Fineman: Thank you for your time last week and your explanation of TINS. It is unfortunate that we have had a misunderstanding relating 
to the use of TINS by Armstrong wholesalers. As you know, Armstrong believes that specialization of sales management and 
sales personnel is the most effective method of distribution of our resilient flooring products. Thanks to your explanation and 
assurances, we now realize that the TINS program would not adversely affect this specialization concept. Our other concern was the degree of availability of the TINS program to our wholesalers. You have addressed this concern by 
assuring us that if TINS is made available to an Armstrong wholesaler in a particular trading area, TINS will be made available 
on a competitively equal basis to all other Armstrong wholesalers in that particular trading area. Therefore, Mr. Fineman, I have sent the attached letters to certain Armstrong wholesalers with which you are having 
negotiations. These letters are intended to clear up any misunderstandings and assure those wholesalers that Armstrong is not, 
in any way, attempting to influence their independent business decisions relating to the use of TINS. Of course, you must realize 
that Armstrong cannot, as a matter of policy, recommend a preference for any product which is neither manufactured nor 
marketed by Armstrong World Industries, Inc. We continue to follow this policy with respect to TINS. Sincerely, D. M. Draeger J.A. at 7775. "
854,36," This ruling was in part premised upon a concern that the jury had been unable to convey coherently whether any portion of 
the $ 17.7 million in antitrust damages and $ 19.5 million in tort damages awarded to TINS overlapped each other. The district court had instructed the jury as follows: If, but only if, you have awarded monetary damages as set forth in answers to both questions 4 and 10, does all or any part of 
each award represent the same damages, and if so, what sum of money is included in both awards? J.A. at 100. The jury first answered $ 37.2 million, revealing that it had simply added the two numbers, so the district court reinstructed the 
jury on that point: "". . . you can't recover twice for the same injury. . . . question number 11 asks you really, was there an 
overlap? . . . If there was commonality, if there was overlap, if there is potential for double recovery under both questions four 
[tort damages] and 10 [antitrust damages], then question 11 asks you to tell me what amount is common to both."" J.A. at 7243-
44. "
855,," The jury then returned with an answer of $ 1.8 million, which, perhaps coincidentally, also represents the difference between $ 
19.5 and $ 17.7 million. Concerned that the jury may have merely subtracted, and not understood the overlap instruction, the 
district pointed out that their figure equalled the difference between the two damage awards and explained that subtracting them 
would not have conformed to his instruction. J.A. at 7251. After retiring once again, the jury returned ""moments later"" with a note 
""We stand by it."" The district court concluded that the jury's $ 17.7 million tort award equalled the damage figure of lost profits claimed by TINS' 
expert witness James Kobak whereas the record lacks any substantiation for an additional $ 17.7 million in lost profits on the 
antitrust claims, as would be true if the ""overlap"" were truly $ 1.8 million. J.A. at 101-02. Our independent review of the record 
also compels this finding."
855,37," We assume that because each would be based upon lost profits, these awards would be identical; if not, we suggest that the 
district court mold them to the conform to the evidence. "
857,*," The second paragraph of this letter fixes a ten day deadline for memoranda of counsel which was adjourned several times at 
joint request of counsel until September 25. The third and fourth paragraphs suggest the possibility - upon consent of both 
parties - of requesting the views of Professor Areeda. Both parties thought this would be inappropriate. "
876,1," The panel made this point, stating, ""perhaps a court could find as a matter of law that Goodyear's predatory bid caused no loss 
if Irvin's bid was so high -- $ 700, for example -- that virtually any nonpredatory Goodyear bid would have resulted in Irvin's loss 
of the contract."" Id. at 6099."
876,2," E.g., Northern Helex Co. v. United States, 225 Ct. Cl. 194, 634 F.2d 557, 560-61 (Ct. Cl. 1980) (trial judge cannot ignore or fail 
to comply with the directions of superior court ""merely because he disagrees with them or believes they are wrong."")."
876,3," In discussing the ""likelihood or unlikelihood"" that Goodyear would have bid precisely between $ 367 and $ 376 in the absence 
of predatory intent, the panel was responding to the argument made by Goodyear on appeal -- an argument not relied on by the 
Court in its summary judgment ruling -- that it is undisputed that Goodyear would have bid precisely in that range in the absence 
of predatory intent. The panel was merely making the common sense point that what Goodyear might or might not have done in 
a hypothetical universe in which it was not predatorily motivated cannot possibly be deemed undisputed. "
877,4," Contrary to this Court's suggestion at the September 3 conference, the antitrust purpose for condemning predatory pricing is 
not to compel new entrants to price below a monopolist's average variable cost or otherwise regulate their prices, but to deter 
monopolists from pricing below average variable cost to discourage or punish new entry. When a firm prices below average 
variable cost, it loses money on each unit it sells. As then Professor, now Judge, Posner explained, ""There is no reason 
consistent with an interest in efficiency for selling a unit at a price lower than the cost that the seller incurs by the sale."" R. 
Posner, Exclusionary Practices and the Antitrust Laws, 41 U. Chi. L. Rev. 506, 519 (1974). A price below average variable cost 
""is condemned precisely because it has the potential to destroy competition."" P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 
720'c at 658-659 (1990 Suppl.)."
877,5, Goodyear repeated its antitrust injury argument in its motion for reconsideration.
877,6," Though it is not germane to the present issue, Irvin also takes exception to the Court's assertion that there is no evidence of 
Goodyear's predatory intent. This misunderstands the legal significance of the average-variable-cost test. When a defendant 
prices below average variable cost (as this Court agrees Irvin's evidence is sufficient to establish) it is presumed to have 
predatory intent. See Northeastern Tel. Co. v. AT&T, 651 F.2d 76 (2nd Cir. 1981). See also VII P. Areeda, Antitrust Law, P 
1506 at 390 (1987) (""A price that is clearly predatory will be condemned no matter how sincere the defendant's belief that he 
was promoting competition."" "
887,1," Sunshine does not make clear, however, whether this regulation is still in effect. "
889,2," Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides in relevant part that HN6[
] ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor"" for treble damages. 15 U.S.C. § 15(a). Section 16 of the 
Clayton Act provides in relevant part that: HN7[
] ""Any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief . . . against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws . . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 26."
889,3," In Otter Tail only one company, either the defendant or a town's municipal electrical power company, could be granted a retail 
franchise in each town. Like Vanguard the dissent in Otter Tail believed competitive structure was relevant, and considered it 
significant that ""a monopoly was sure to result either way."" 410 U.S. at 388-89. The majority found it unnecessary to deal with 
the dissent's concern, and held that the defendant violated the antitrust laws by refusing to sell its wholesale electrical power to 
the municipal companies. Id. at 377. Because of defendant's refusal to sell, the municipal companies were unable to compete "
890,," against the defendant for the retail franchises as they were unable to obtain power at the wholesale level other than by 
purchasing it from defendant."
890,4," Like Vanguard, defendants in Fishman v. Estate of Wirtz, 807 F.2d 520, 533 (7th Cir. 1986), argued there could be no antitrust 
injury because ""substitution of one competitor for another does not injure competition."" The court determined that defendants' 
refusal to lease their stadium to plaintiffs ""effectively cut off all competition for acquisition of the Bulls franchise and injured 
plaintiffs as a result."" Id. Although defendants and plaintiff could never meet in head-to-head competition in the relevant market 
because only one group would be able to buy the Bulls franchise, the court found an antitrust injury explaining, HN8[
] ""the 
antitrust laws are concerned with the competitive process . . . . A healthy and unimpaired competitive process is presumed to be 
in the consumer interest."" Id. at 536."
890,5," In Disenos, the court explained that HN10[
] just because another group could also bring a monopoly claim does not mean 
that the plaintiff's claim is barred. 676 F. Supp. at 1279. "
892,6," HN16[
] Limiting the relevant market to a particular group of customers may be particularly appropriate in monopsony cases. 
In Jayco Systems, Inc. v. Savin Business Machines Corp., 777 F.2d 306 (5th Cir. 1985), cert. den. 479 U.S. 816, 93 L. Ed. 2d 
30, 107 S. Ct. 73 (1986), plaintiff alleged that defendant attempted to monopolize the copier business of one customer, the State 
of Texas, and defined the relevant market as low and medium volume copiers for that customer's copier business. The 5th 
Circuit explained that ""as a matter of common sense a single purchaser of a product cannot generally be considered a relevant 
market, lest we wish to clothe each and every sale with an antitrust suit."" Id. at 320. However, the court noted, ""We hazard the 
suggestion that a single purchaser could not be considered a relevant market unless plaintiff made some showing or the 
purchaser's monopsony power."" Id. at n.46."
892,7," Under a monopoly leveraging theory, plaintiff must prove that the defendant has monopoly power in the first market, and that it 
is using that power as a lever to secure competitive advantages in a second market, irrespective of the degree of market power 
actually achieved by the defendant in the second market. See Grand Light & Supply Co. v. Honeywell, Inc., 771 F.2d 672, 681 
(2d Cir. 1985); Soap Opera Now, 737 F. Supp. at 1344. However, the Second Circuit has pointed out that its monopoly 
leveraging theory was dictum and involved a ""tying"" claim which may suggest the theory is inapplicable to non-""tying"" claims. 
See Twin Laboratories, Inc. v. Weider Health & Fitness, 900 F.2d at 570-571. Sunshine does not assert a tying claim. "
893,8," As in its attack on Sunshine's antitrust injury theory, Vanguard erroneously attacks Sunshine's relevant market definition based 
on ""competitive structure"". Here, Vanguard contends competition must be structured such that plaintiff and defendant are 
engaged in ""head-to-head"" competition in the relevant market, and that it is not in such a competition with Sunshine because it 
does not now sell cellular services in Pennsylvania 8. However, in Otter Tail since only one party could be awarded a franchise, 
they could never compete head-to-head in the relevant market of providing retail electricity. See 410 U.S. at 377. Furthermore, 
Sunshine has alleged that it and Vanguard are engaged in a form of competition with respect to the second market. In essence, 
the parties are competing to determine whether Sunshine will continue to have access to the market, or whether Vanguard will 
gain access to the market by displacing Sunshine. This form of competition is sufficient. See Fishman, 807 F.2d at 520 
HN18[
] (relevant market may be ""the market to which access is sought"")."
893,9," Vanguard is correct that the Second Circuit has stated that a ""threshold showing for a successful attempted monopolization 
claim is sufficient market share by the defendant;"" however, the opinion in which this statement was made involved an appeal of 
a summary judgment decision which requires much more factual proof than a motion to dismiss. Twin Laboratories, 900 F.2d at 
570. "
895,10," See e.g., Official Airline Guides, Inc. v. FTC, 630 F.2d 920, 925-926 (2d Cir. 1980), cert. den., 450 U.S. 917, 67 L. Ed. 2d 
343, 101 S. Ct. 1362 (1981) (since monopolist in airline schedule publishing industry was engaged in a different line of 
commerce from that of air carriers, its refusal to publish the air carriers' flight schedules could not be regarded as a refusal to 
deal or denial of essential facility); Ferguson v. Greater Pocatello Chamber of Commerce, Inc., 848 F.2d 976, 982-983 (9th Cir. 
1988) (college was not in business of producing trade shows, so it could not be accused of denying trade show producers an 
essential facility when it refused to rent them its stadium for their trade shows). "
898,11," In addition, although Vanguard argues that Sunshine's choice of forum is not entitled to deference, HN33[
] a defendant's 
burden on a motion to transfer is ""especially heavy in antitrust suits, where plaintiff's choice of forum is entitled to particular 
respect."" Star Lines, Ltd. v. Puerto Rico Maritime Shipping Auth., 442 F. Supp. 1201, 1207 (S.D.N.Y. 1978) (Carter, J.); see also, 
Expoconsul Int'l., Inc. v. A/E Systems, Inc., 711 F. Supp. 730, 735 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (Walker, J.). There is strong enough 
connection to this district to warrant deference to Sunshine's choice. Part of Vanguard's Pennsylvania Supersystem is located 
here, so potential customers of Sunshine's roaming service are located here. Sunshine alleges that Vanguard's refusal to deal 
and denial of an essential facility have precluded it from reaching these customers, and that this lack of access may force it out 
of business. "
901,1," Chief Judge of the Eastern District of Texas, sitting by designation. "
902,2," Anago cites one post-Cargill district court case from this circuit in which the court denied the defendant's motion to dismiss, for 
lack of standing, a target's request for a preliminary injunction for alleged antitrust violations.  Copeland Enterprises, Inc. v. 
Guste, 1988 WL 129318, 1989-2 (CCH) P 68,712 (E.D.La.1988). The court ultimately denied the injunction. On appeal, the 
defendant again asserted the standing argument. This court affirmed summarily, without written opinion. It is unclear, therefore, 
whether the panel accepted the defendant's standing argument or agreed with the district court on the merits of the case.  
Church's v. Copeland, 865 F.2d 1264 (5th Cir.1989). Consequently, we find very little guidance in the case. "
903,*," Chief Judge of the Eastern District of Texas, sitting by designation. "
905,1," In order to state a claim for monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2, a plaintiff must prove: (1) Possession of monopoly power in the relevant market; (2) willful acquisition or maintenance of that power; and (3) causal antitrust injury. Pacific Express, Inc. v. United Airlines, Inc., 959 F.2d 814, 817 (9th Cir.1992). While the following facts must be proved to 
establish an attempt to monopolize claim: (1) specific intent to control prices or destroy competition; (2) predatory or anticompetitive conduct to accomplish the monopolization; (3) dangerous probability of success; and (4) causal antitrust injury. "
906,," Id. And ""predatory pricing may be defined as pricing below an appropriate measure of cost for the purpose of eliminating 
competitors in the short run and reducing competition in the long run."" Cargill, 479 U.S. at 117-118, 107 S. Ct. at 493. But 
operating at substantially reduced profit margins does not amount to pricing in a predatory manner; it is simply pricing in a 
competitive manner.  Phototron Corp. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 842 F.2d 95, 99 (5th Cir.1988). While the Cargill Court spoke only to the predatory pricing theory presented to it, I see no reason why a Sherman Act 
Section 1-oriented theory could not fulfill Cargill's prophesy of target standing in a Clayton Act Section 7 case. Section 1 of 
the Sherman Act prohibits conspiracies in restraint of trade. See 15 U.S.C. § 1. I foresee that a would-be acquirer could 
conspire to restrain trade by eliminating a targeted competitor through an anticompetitive merger--and through such 
conspiracy, inflict antitrust injury upon the target. "
911,1," Soda ash, the common name for anhydrous sodium carbonate, is primarily used in making glass."
911,2," As the district court explained: (1) Defendant Stauffer Chemical Company is wholly owned by the French corporation, Rhone Poulenc Chemie S.A., the 
third largest producer of soda ash in the world. (2) Defendant TG Soda Ash is wholly owned by the French chemical 
conglomerate, Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine, a major manufacturer of caustic soda (a soda ash substitute). (3) Defendant 
Chemical General Partners is forty-nine percent owned by Australian Consolidated Industries, a major re-seller of soda ash. 
(4) Defendant Tenneco Minerals has entered into a joint venture with Japanese-owned ASAHI Glass, the largest Japanese 
producer of soda ash, to exploit Tenneco Minerals' soda ash reserves. (5) Defendant Kerr-McGee recently sold its soda 
ash reserves to North American Chemical Company, which is thirty-percent owned by the largest Korean producer of soda 
ash, Oriental Chemical Industries. (6) Only defendant FMC Wyoming Corporation is not linked to a foreign enterprise 
significantly engaged in the production or sale of soda ash or caustic soda. International Raw Materials, Ltd. v Stauffer Chemical Co., 767 F Supp 687, 688, (ED Pa 1991) (""IRM III"")."
911,3," For example, in September 1984, the owner of General Chemical Partners informed IRM that, beginning November 1, 1984, 
all negotiations for terminalling would have to be pursued through ANSAC. Shortly thereafter, the other soda ash producers 
followed suit, and those who then had contracts with IRM assigned them to ANSAC."
911,4," These rates ranged from $ 5.65 to $ 8.46 per metric ton, depending on tonnage."
911,5," In contrast to the flat rate of $ 3.72 per metric ton offered by IRM, ANSAC and Hall-Buck agreed to a rate of $ 3.60 per metric 
ton up to 500,000 tons and $ 2.60 per metric ton over that amount. "
912,6," The Agreement provides: The estimated cost of construction of the Terminal is $ 4,300,000. On the basis of this estimate, and an assumption that the 
investment cost will be amortized over fifteen (15) years, at the end of the initial five-year term of this Agreement, there will 
be an unamortized cost of $ 2,866,667. In the event that ANSAC does not renew the contract after the initial five-year term, 
ANSAC shall pay to Hall-Buck $ 1,433,333 within thirty (30) days after completion of five years of operation, regardless of 
the actual investment cost and unamortized cost. ANSAC shall have the option, exercisable by written notice to Hall-Buck, 
to require that an economic arrangement be entered into between ANSAC and Hall-Buck providing for ANSAC's ownership, 
in consideration for making the above referenced payment, of 50% of the Terminal. IRM III, 767 F Supp at 690. "
913,7," The case was reassigned to a different district judge, the judge originally assigned to the case having become ill."
913,8, The district court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 USC §§ 1331 & 1337(a). 
916,9," We note that the FTC has expressed the view that foreign ownership or control of an association member does not abrogate 
the immunity conferred by the Act. An inquiry submitted to the FTC in 1973 asked: Is it a violation of the antitrust laws of the United States for an export association to include as a member of that association 
a corporation, incorporated in one of the States of the United States, which is owned or otherwise controlled by foreign 
interests?"
916,83," FTC 1840 (1973) (1973). In an advisory opinion, the Commission responded: The Commission is of the opinion that membership in an export (Webb-Pomerene) association by a United States 
corporation, which is owned or controlled by foreign interests, in and of itself, would not violate the laws administered by the 
Commission. Id. Because the FTC's interpretation of the Act in its 1973 advisory opinion is in accord with our construction of the statute, we need 
not decide whether Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S Ct 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 
694 (1984), which requires judicial deference to an agency's legislative rules, overruled General Elec. Co. v Gilbert, 429 U.S. 
125, 141-42, 97 S Ct 401, 410-11, 50 L.Ed.2d 343 (1976), which held that an agency's interpretive decisions demanded less 
judicial deference. Although the D.C. Circuit has held that an agency's interpretive decisions should receive Chevron deference, 
see Wagner Seed Co. v Bush, 292 U.S. App. D.C. 44, 946 F2d 918, 922 (DC Cir 1991), cert. denied, 118 L. Ed. 2d 304, 112 S 
Ct 1584 (1992), this and other courts have not yet decided the issue. See, for example, Griffon v United States Dep't of Health & 
Human Servs., 802 F2d 146, 148 n.3 (5th Cir 1986) ,(leaving unresolved whether Chevron applies to interpretive rules). See 
also Cass R. Sunstein, Law and Administration after Chevron, 90 Colum L Rev 2071, 2093-94 (1990) (Chevron deference 
should apply only to agency's statutory interpretations pursuant to legislative rulemaking authority). "
917,10," In a footnote to its opening brief before this court, IRM asserts that the district court ""mistakenly assumed that IRM was not 
also a soda ash reseller that competed with ANSAC,"" and cites to an affidavit stating that a company affiliated with IRM, Pacific "
918,," International Raw Materials, Ltd., distributes bulk chemicals, including soda ash, in New Zealand. But this does not suffice. More 
importantly, IRM's complaint does not allege that IRM is a consumer or producer of soda ash."
918,11," In a footnote to its reply brief, IRM raises a separate conspiracy theory. It notes that Count II of its amended complaint 
includes an allegation that ANSAC and its members have conspired to boycott IRM's terminal both in the case of ANSAC 
shipments and of non-ANSAC shipments made by the individual members. Unlike the soda ash market conspiracy theory 
discussed in the text, this alleged conspiracy is not between immune and non-immune parties. Rather, it involves parties who 
are immune, but acts -- non-ANSAC shipments -- that are not. Moreover, and in further contrast to the alleged soda ash 
conspiracy, this alleged conspiracy constitutes IRM's cause of action. We need not decide the merits of this second conspiracy theory, however. IRM did not include the theory in its Statement of 
Issues presented for review on appeal, and did not mention it in its opening brief before this court. We have repeatedly 
emphasized that failure to raise a theory as an issue on appeal constitutes a waiver because ""consideration of that theory would 
vitiate the requirement of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and our own local rules that, absent extraordinary 
circumstances, briefs must contain statements of all issues presented for appeal, together with supporting arguments and 
citations."" Simmons v Philadelphia, 947 F2d 1042, 1065 (3d Cir 1991), cert. denied, 118 L. Ed. 2d 391, 112 S Ct 1671 (1992). 
Accord Brenner v United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, 927 F2d 1283, 1298 (3d Cir 1991). By raising the 
theory for the first time on appeal in its reply brief, IRM has foreclosed our consideration of this issue and has waived reliance on 
the theory. See Hoxworth v Blinder, Robinson & Co., 903 F2d 186, 205 n.29 (3d Cir 1990) (""As a general matter, the courts of 
appeal will not consider arguments raised on appeal for the first time in a reply brief"")."
918,12," Although this court has articulated some distinction between the concepts of standing and antitrust injury, see, for example, 
Alberta Gas Chemicals, Ltd. v E.I. Du Pont De Nemours, 826 F2d 1235, 1240 (3d Cir 1987) (""Once antitrust injury has been 
demonstrated by a causal relationship between the harm and the challenged aspect of the alleged violation, standing analysis is 
employed to search for the most effective plaintiff from among those who have suffered loss""), it has acknowledged that ""in the 
sense that plaintiffs who sustain no antitrust injury may not recover, they may be loosely said to lack standing."" Id. In Associated 
Gen. Contractors, the Supreme Court collapsed the two issues into one broad inquiry. See Associated Gen. Contractors, 459 
U.S. at 535-544, 103 S Ct at 907-911. In this opinion, we refer to standing and antitrust injury interchangeably. As Professors 
Areeda and Hovenkamp have explained, the ""characterizations are largely immaterial"" because the concepts are functionally 
equivalent. Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, 1 Antitrust Law P 334.3 at 377.3 at 377 (1991 Supp). "
919,13," In fact, despite the ruling of the district court that IRM lacked standing, see IRM III, 767 F Supp 693 n.14, on appeal IRM has 
not presented an argument that it does have standing to raise this claim. Instead, IRM has merely offered an unsupported 
assertion that ANSAC's actions in the international soda ash market have reduced competition in the terminalling market. It is 
well-established that a party cannot avoid summary judgment based on mere allegations in its pleadings. See Celotex Corp. v 
Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S Ct 2548, 2552-53, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). For this reason, as well as those discussed at 
pages 38-39, IRM's claim cannot survive a motion for summary judgment."
919,14, Process had not been served on the other members. 
929,1," The defendants contend that there is no Sherman Act jurisdiction in this case. We find that, for the purposes of jurisdiction, 
Austin's allegations are on all fours with those in Pinhas v. Summit health, 894 F.2d 1024 (9th Cir. 1989), aff'd, 111 S. Ct. 1842 
(1991). We therefore reject defendants' challenge to our jurisdiction."
929,2," Austin does not appeal the dismissal of the pendent state law claims; thus, only the antitrust claims are before this court. "
930,3," The defendants assert that Austin waived his right to challenge the district court's grant of summary judgment because he did 
not address the applicability of HCQIA in the district court. We find no fatal waiver. The defendants raised HCQIA as an 
affirmative defense. The issue is one of law, and no factual showing was required of Austin in response to the defense. The 
record is complete. We elect to address the issue. "
931,4," Austin grounds this suggestion on certain interactions between the other doctors and him. He alleges that: 1) the other 
neurosurgeons in the Santa Barbara area refused to ""cover"" for him; 2) Drs. St. John and Jones ""openly demeaned Dr. Austin's 
work to nurses on staff at Cottage Hospital in order to develop animosity over [sic] Dr. Austin""; 3) the other neurosurgeons 
engaged in ""aggressive attacks on Dr. Austin's judgment at the monthly meetings of the neursurgical [sic] group meetings [sic] at 
the Cottage Hospital."""
931,5," A contrary holding would frustrate the apparent intent of Congress. The House Report on HCQIA stated that The Committee intends that these provisions allow defendants to file motions to resolve the issue of immunity in as expeditious a 
manner as possible. The provisions would allow a court to make a determination that the defendant has or has not met the 
standards specified in section [11112(a)]. The Committee intends that the court could so rule even though other issues in the 
case remain to be resolved. For example, a court might determine at an early stage of litigation that the defendant has met the 
[11112(a)] standards, even though the plaintiff might be able to demonstrate that the professional review action was otherwise 
improper. H.R. Rep. No. 903, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 12, reprinted in 1986 Code Cong. & Admin. News 6394. "
932,6," The JRC discussed Austin's treatment of five patients whose treatment had been the focus of the MEC's investigation. The 
JRC found that the proof was evenly balanced in three cases and that in one case Austin's conduct was not below the applicable 
standard."
932,7," Section 416 of HCQIA is to be found in the U.S. Code among the ""Historical and Statutory Notes."""
932,8," Amici American Medical Association and California Medical Association contend that the JRC review of the November 19 
revocation was not a separate action, but a continuation of the revocation action. Because nothing in this case turns on that 
issue, we need not resolve it. "
933,9," The interpretation of a statute is a question of law that we review de novo.  Batchelor v. Oak Hill Medical Group, 870 F.2d 1446, 
1447 (9th Cir. 1989)."
933,10," The district court held that the ""action"" occurred when the MEC voted to revoke Austin's privileges on November 19, 1986. 
That action was preceded, however, by Dr. McNamara's suspension of Austin's privileges on November 17, 1986. It is quite 
possible that the ""action"" affecting Austin's privileges commenced with the November 17 suspension, but that fact does not 
affect our decision; both events - Dr. McNamara's suspension and the MEC's revocation - occurred after the November 14 
effective date of HCQIA. "
935,11," The one Ninth Circuit case that Austin cites as stating that injury to a competitor is sufficient, Pinhas v. Summit Health, actually 
undercuts his position. That case involved the district court's dismissal of Pinhas' complaint. We ruled (in a portion of the opinion 
not affected by the Supreme Court's opinion) that injury to Pinhas was sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss, but also indicated 
that a showing of injury to competition would be required at the summary judgment stage.  Pinhas, 894 F.2d at 1032. 
Furthermore, Pinhas' complaint, unlike Austin's, alleged that he provided surgery more cheaply than his competitors; we placed 
great emphasis on this contention, stating that, in light of the allegation of lower prices, Pinhas might be able to demonstrate that 
his suspension allowed other doctors to charge higher prices. Id. Nowhere in Pinhas did we suggest that injury to Pinhas alone 
would constitute sufficient evidence of injury to competition. "
937,1," Congress passed HCQIA to meet ""an overriding national need to provide incentive and protection for physicians engaging in 
effective professional peer review."" 42 U.S.C. § 11101(5) (emphasis added)."
937,2," Section 11112(a) provides, in pertinent part, For purposes of the [immunity] protection . . ., a professional review action must be taken - (1) in the reasonable belief that the action was in the furtherance of quality health care, "
938,," (2) after a reasonable effort to obtain the facts of the matter, (3) after adequate notice and hearing procedures are afforded to the physician involved or after such other procedures as are 
fair to the physician under the circumstances, and (4) in the reasonable belief that the action was warranted by the facts known after such reasonable effort to obtain facts and 
after meeting the requirement of paragraph (3) . . . ."
938,3," Congress has interpreted the ""reasonable belief"" standard to mean a ""more objective reasonable belief standard."" See 1986 
U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 6392-93. The majority opinion concludes that Dr. Austin's proffer of evidence to show defendants' harmful intent or motive is irrelevant 
because of this objective standard. I disagree. Evidence of motive and intent is relevant to show whether the defendants 
possessed a reasonable belief that the final revocation was warranted by the facts known. Moreover, the legislative history discussing the due process requirements of section 11112 makes clear that it is essential that 
""physicians receive fair and unbiased review to protect their reputation and medical practices."" 1986 Code Cong. & Admin. News 
at 6393. Any inquiry into the reasonableness of the reviewers' beliefs should at least consider any evidence of bias or ulterior 
motive even though an objective standard ultimately applies."
938,4," After his suspension, Dr. Austin requested a hearing pursuant to hospital policy before the JRC which was comprised of six 
impartial doctors. "
939,5," The district court held that even though the JRC found Dr. Austin's suspension to be unreasonable, a jury could find that the 
defendants had a reasonable belief that their decision was warranted. The district court relied in part on the fact that the JRC did 
in fact impose ""significant restrictions"" on the reinstatement of Dr. Austin's privileges. There is some question, however, whether these conditions were significant restrictions on Dr. Austin's practice. The district 
court found that the conditions imposed were ""significant restrictions that are out of the ordinary for a surgeon of Plaintiff's 
experience."" Austin v. McNamara, 731 F. Supp. 934, 938 (C.D. Cal. 1990). Dr. Austin produced the testimony of Dr. Henry W. 
Dodge who questioned the severity of the conditions. Dr. Dodge believed the conditions were to ""be expected of any other 
physician practicing medicine and surgery in the state of California."" "

professional teams sport[] of . . . basketball . . . by which any league of clubs . . . sells or otherwise transfers all or any part of the 
rights of such league's member clubs in the sponsored telecasting of the games . . . engaged in or conducted by such clubs."

at the same time as the telecast of a [TNT] Game."" NBA-TNT Contract, § 11(A). "
943,3," The Seventh Circuit posited the following hypothetical arrangements: What if the league had assumed control of all broadcast rights and licensed only 20 of the Bull's games to WGN? . . . The league 
might have put a cap of 20 superstation games in its contracts with NBC and [TNT], or it might have followed the path of 
professional baseball and allowed unlimited broadcasting over superstations while claiming a portion of the revenues for 
distribution among the clubs."
943,961," F.2d at 671. However, after considering these hypothetical examples, the court stated: Whether there are ways to achieve the NBA's objective is not the question. . . . Perhaps the reason the NBA has not 
commandeered all of the telecasting rights and sold limited numbers of games to superstations is that it cannot obtain the 
approval of the clubs to do this -- for a change in the allocation of rights is apt to affect the allocation of revenues, making the 
bargaining problem more difficult with 27 clubs. A league's difficulty in rearranging its affairs to obtain the protection of the Sports 
Broadcasting Act is one source of protection for competition. . . . what the NBA might have done. it did not do. . . . Id. (emphasis added)."
943,4," The Seventh Circuit stated: Both [NBC and TNT) contracts and, so far as we can tell, the league's articles and bylaws, reserve to the individual clubs the full 
copyright interest in all games that the league has not sold to the networks."
943,961, F.2d at 671.
943,5," Legislative history illuminates the narrow purpose of the SBA. HN3[

antitrust laws. See S. Rep. No. 1087, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. at 1 (1961) (The SBA was intended ""to enable the member clubs to 
pool their separate rights in the sponsored broadcasting of their games and to permit the league to sell the resulting package of 
pooled rights to a purchaser, such as a television network, without violating the antitrust laws.""); H.R. Rep. No. 1178, 87th Cong.,

See Subscription Television, Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Communications and Power of The Committee on Interstate 
and Foreign Commerce, House of Representatives, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. at 267-68 (1958). The 1967 hearings characterized subscription television as a ""pay television program,"" meaning ""any television program to be

compensation."" See Subscription Television, Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Communications and Power of The

949,1, Our prior opinions are reported in 826 F.2d 712 (1987) and 866 F.2d 228 (1988). 
951,2," Even if the inquiry did turn on 1992 antitrust law, it is far from clear that tied market power is not required, as the lower court 
concluded. No Supreme Court case has resolved the issue. The most recent tying case from the High Court, Eastman Kodak 
Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc., 119 L. Ed. 2d 265, 112 S. Ct. 2072 (1992), turns on other issues but affirms a Ninth 
Circuit decision that found market power in the tied product market. "
952,3," Tying arrangements are traditionally held to be per se violations of the antitrust laws. International Salt Co. v. United States, 
332 U.S. 392, 396, 92 L. Ed. 20 , 68 S. Ct. 12 . The per se rule operates basically as an assumption that an activity violates the 
antitrust laws without delving into the particulars of the market in question. The notion is to avoid a burdensome, expensive 
inquiry into market conditions where the likelihood of anticompetitive conduct is great.  Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. 
Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 15-16, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2 , 104 S. Ct. 1551 n.25. However, per se analysis in the tying context does, in fact, 
require an inquiry into economic conditions and effects. Thus, the per se doctrine as applied to tying cases has occasioned 
much criticism for ""incurring the costs of a rule-of-reason approach without achieving its benefits: the doctrine calls for the 
extensive and time-consuming economic analysis characteristic of the rule of reason, but then may be interpreted to prohibit 
arrangements that economic analysis would show to be beneficial."" Id. at 34 (O'Connor, J., concurring). In any event, Sandburg 
Village requires a showing of market power in the tied market under both the per se and more forgiving rule-of-reason standards. "
972,1," The plaintiff Ortho is a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson engaged in the business of research, development, and 
marketing of pharmaceutical products. The other plaintiffs (the ""Cilag co-plaintiffs"") are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Johnson & 
Johnson organized respectively under the laws of various European nations. Defendant Genetics is a Delaware corporation with 
its principal place of business in Massachusetts. Defendant Amgen is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business 
in California. It should be noted that Ortho and the Cilag co-plaintiffs, after filing the complaint, moved to realign defendant Amgen as a 
plaintiff, but the Court denied this motion on November 14, 1991."
972,2," Amgen also contends that Ortho fails to state a claim against Amgen for the simple reason that, while Ortho has named 
Amgen as a defendant, Ortho in fact seeks no relief from Amgen. Given that this Court has denied Ortho's motion to realign 
Amgen as a plaintiff, see supra n. 1, Amgen's contention is technically true. The analysis set forth herein, however, moots their 
point. "
973,3," For more detailed scientific and historical background concerning EPO and the claims covered under the '008 patent, see 
Amgen II, 927 F.2d at 1203-04; Amgen I, 706 F. Supp. at 95-97, 106-11. See generally William R. Carlson, Erythropoietin: The 
Development of a Pharmaceutical Product (1988) (unpublished A.B. Thesis, Department of Molecular Biology, Princeton

973,4," The Court notes that both PLA's use the words ""exclusive license"" to describe the rights Ortho obtains from Kirin-Amgen and 
Amgen respectively. Whether these words have the legal effect of making Ortho an exclusive licensee under patent law, 
however, is a question the Court resolves infra at 10-25."
973,5," The Court's reading of the Ortho-Amgen agreements indicates that they did not provide for Amgen to receive any royalties on 
Ortho's European sales. Neither Amgen nor Genetics has argued to the contrary. "
974,6," Ortho's motion to intervene was not denied for lack of standing. It was denied on the grounds that the motion was untimely and 
that Amgen could adequately represent Ortho's interests with respect to the liability issue."

977,8," The Court emphasizes that the claims covered by the '008 patent are product claims, not process claims. See Amgen I, 706 F. 
Supp. at 110."
977,9," In determining the legal effect of the license agreements, the Court is required to interpret the terms of these agreements. 
None of the parties has briefed the question of which law the Court should apply in interpreting such contracts. That is, do 
federal courts, sitting in federal question jurisdiction patent cases rely on state contract law or do they apply some sort of federal 
common law of contracts? The few cases cited by the parties to support their particular interpretations of the disputed provisions 
in the license agreements do not reflect any consistent view or theory as to which law applies. According to 6 Lipscomb, Walker on Patents § 20:58 at 202 (1987), HN8[
] ""the general rules of construction for contracts are 
applicable to the construction of patent licenses. The construction of patent license agreements is governed by state law."" The 
Court adopts this view, and therefore applies California contract law because the license agreements specify that they are to ""be 
construed in accordance with the internal laws, and not the law of conflicts, of the state of California applicable to agreements 
made and to be performed in that state."" PLA § 10.8. "
978,13," The Court, however, disagrees with Amgen's and Genetics' first point contending that Ortho's asserted exclusive license 
exceeds the territorial limitations of the '008 patent. Were this Court to hold that the field-of-use limitation in the license was 
within the scope of the '008 patent, the Court would then hold that it does not exceed the territorial boundaries of the patent 
because it simply licenses the use of the patented invention in the United States for a particular purpose. "
979,14," Ortho also argues that as a matter of equity and policy it should have standing to sue here because it is the only party which 
can recover from Genetics those damages resulting from lost European sales. As it also argues in its motion to intervene in the 
lead case, Ortho contends that Amgen is not entitled to recover damages for lost European sales because Amgen, under the 
license agreements, is not entitled to any royalty payments from Ortho on such sales. Whatever the merits of this argument may 
be, it cannot provide the basis for standing. HN14[
] The key question for determining standing of a licensee is whether the 
licensee as matter of law has an exclusive property interest in the patent itself, not whether the licensee in fact has been harmed 
by a third-party infringer. As Judge Learned Hand explained in A.L. Smith Iron Co. v. Dickson, 141 F.2d 3, 6 (2d Cir. 1944), there 
are strong policy reasons why patent law does not confer standing on a nonexclusive licensee to sue a third party for 
infringement even though the licensee has suffered due to the infringement: It is indeed true that a mere licensee may have an interest at stake in such a suit; his license may be worth much more to him 
than the royalties which he has agreed to pay, and its value will ordinarily depend on his ability to suppress the competition of his 
rivals. The reason why he is not permitted to sue is not because he has nothing to protect. But against that interest is the interest 
of the infringer to be immune from a second suit by the owner of the patent; and also the interest of the patent owner to be free 
to choose his forum . . . . Indeed, the owner may have granted a number of licenses, and it would be exceedingly oppressive to 
subject him to the will of all his licensees. These two interests in combination of have been held to overweight any interest of the 
licensee[.] "
980,15," The Court notes that the co-plaintiffs would not have standing to sue as exclusive licensees even if Ortho were determined to 
have such legal capacity. This is because the sub-licenses the co-plaintiffs received from Ortho do not involve any right of 
manufacture of EPO under the '008 patent in the U.S. These sub-licenses only grant each Cilag affiliate the exclusive right to sell 
EPO in a particular country abroad. Thus, Genetics' act of infringement - the use of the patented inventions to manufacture EPO 
in the United States - did not infringe on the exclusive rights of these affiliates. Therefore they lack the legal capacity to sue 
Genetics even if Ortho does not."
980,16," Having determined as matter of law that Ortho and its co-plaintiffs are not exclusive licensees for the purpose of suing 
Genetics for infringement of the '0008 patent, the Court need not address the issues raised by the parties concerning the 
allocation of the right to sue under section 8.02 of the PLA. HN15[
] A contractual provision providing a licensee with a right to 
sue cannot confer on that licensee a right to sue under the patent laws where there is no such right under the patent laws. See 6 
Chisum, Patents § 21.03[2][e] at 21-161 (citing inter alia Crown Die & Tool Co. v. Nye Tool & Mach. Works, 261 U.S. 24, 67 L. 
Ed. 516, 43 S. Ct. 254 [1923]; Agrashell, Inc. v. Hammons Prod. Co., 352 F.2d 443, 446 [8th Cir. 19656]; Philadelphia Brief 
Case Co., 145 F. Supp. at 130)."
980,17," Rule 42 provides: (a) HN16[
] Consolidation. When actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order 
a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated; and it may make 
such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay. (b) Separate Trials. The court, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to 
expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any claim, cross-claim, counterclaim, or third-party claim, or of any 
separate issue or any number of claims, cross-claims, counterclaims, third-party claims, or issues, always preserving inviolate 
the right of trial by jury as declared by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution or as given by a statute of the United States."
980,18," I conclude, based on the information before the court, that Ortho's motion for intervention should be denied even if treated as 
a motion brought pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 24. Rule 24, entitled ""Intervention,"" sets forth the requirements for ""intervention of 
right"" and ""permissive intervention."" Rule 24(a), governing intervention of right, requires a court to grant intervention where: Upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action: (1) when a statute of the United States confers an 
unconditional right to intervene; or (2) when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the "
981,," subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede 
the applicant's ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant's interest is adequately represented by existing parties. Rule 24(b), governing permissive intervention, explains when a court may, but is not required to, permit intervention: Upon timely application anyone may be permitted to intervene in an action: (1) when a statute of the United States confers a 
conditional right to intervene; or (2) when an applicant's claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in 
common. . . . In exercising its discretion the court shall consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the 
adjudication of the rights of the original parties. Rule 24(a) Analysis: There is no federal statute conferring on Ortho an unconditional right to intervene in the case at bar. 
Therefore, Ortho only can intervene of right if it meets four requirements: (1) its application must be ""timely""; (2) it must claim an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action; (3) it must be so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede [its] ability to protect that 
interest; and (4) it must show that its interest will not be adequately represented by Amgen and/or Genetics. Travelers Indem. Co. v. Dingwell, 884 F.2d 629, 637 (1st Cir. 1989). The four-factor approach to evaluating timeliness is set forth in Banco Popular de Puerto Rico v. Greenblatt, 964 F.2d 1227 (1st 
Cir. 1992). Ortho would appear to have no difficulty meeting the inadequacy of representation requirement by virtue of the fact 
that Genetics and Amgen appear close to settlement. See Conservation Law Foundation, 966 F.2d at 44. While it may have 
more difficulty meeting the timeliness requirement, Ortho most clearly does not satisfy the second requirement -- the interest 
requirement. The First Circuit's approach to determining whether an applicant's claimed interest justifies intervention of right is 
set forth in Conservation Law Foundation, Inc. v. Mosbacher, 966 F.2d 39 (1st Cir. 1992). The First Circuit follows neither the 
liberal approach of the D.C. Circuit and three other circuits, nor the more restrictive approach of the Courts of Appeals for the 
Fifth, Seventh, Eleventh, and Federal Circuits. Id. at 41-43. Instead, the First Circuit requires inter alia that ""the interest must be 
direct, not contingent."" Id. at 42 (quoting Travelers Indem., 884 F.2d at 638). While Ortho may have an interest in preserving 
Genetics' assets so that, if Ortho obtains a judgment in another pending action in which Genetics is a defendant, see supra at 8, 
Ortho will be able to recover damages, this is only a contingent interest because it depends on the contingency of Ortho's 
success in some other suit. See generally id. at 42 (discussing ruling in Travelers Indem., 884 F.2d at 638-39 that the applicant's 
interest was only contingent and therefore did not merit intervention of right). Because Ortho does not appear to satisfy the 
interest requirement, intervention must be denied under Rule 24(a). Rule 24(b) Analysis: Likewise, Ortho cannot satisfy the requirements for permissive intervention. As a threshold matter, an 
applicant for intervention under Rule 24(b) must establish an independent basis for jurisdiction. International Paper Co. v. Jay, 
887 F.2d 338, 346 (1st Cir. 1989). This Court has ruled that Ortho lacks the legal standing to state a claim against Genetics 
under the patent law. Ortho appears to have neo other claim against Genetics that could confer federal jurisdiction. Therefore, 
without even considering whether Ortho meets the other requirements of Rule 24(b), this Court must deny Ortho's application for 
permissive intervention. "
998,1," At the preliminary hearing held on October 28, 1992, the parties significantly narrowed the issues in dispute. For purposes of 
this motion, the Court need only address two of the remaining issues: 1) Has Muzak discriminated against WMNI in violation of 
the WFDL, and 2) Does the Multi-Territory Account (""MTA"") program violate the antitrust laws."
998,2, The parties use the terms affiliate and franchisee interchangeably.
998,3," This is a point of dispute between Muzak and WMNI. As the Court will discuss further, all similarly situated affiliates are being 
treated identically. "
999,4," In Les Moise, Rossignol (grantor) sent Les Moise (dealer) notice in January of 1980 that termination would be effective on May 
21, 1980, the date of the expiration of their agreement. Suit was filed by Les Moise on April 14, 1981, within one year of the date 
of actual termination, but more than one year after notice had been given."
999,5," Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law, Chapter 135, Stats. The two sections relevant to this decision; HN3[
] Wis. Stat. § 135.03 Cancellation and alteration of dealerships. ""No grantor, directly or through any officers, agent, or employee, may terminate, cancel, fail to renew, or substantially change the competitive circumstances of a dealership 
agreement without good cause. The burden of proving good cause is on the grantor."" HN4[
] Wis. Stat. § 135.02(4) ""Good Cause"" means: (a) ""Failure by a dealer to comply substantially with essential and reasonable requirements imposed upon him by the grantor, or sought to be imposed by the grantor, which requirements are not 
discriminatory as compared with requirements imposed on other similarly situated dealers either by their terms or in the manner 
of their enforcement."" (b) ""Bad Faith by the dealer in carrying out the terms of the dealership."""
999,6," What is unclear about WMNI's position is whether it believes the term of its contract is month to month or nine years as under 
the 1980 Agreement. If its position is the former, this cannot be a termination case, if it is the latter, it is incorrect. "
1000,7," The court in Ziegler further stated, ""We hold that when a dealer refuses to substantially comply with the terms of a contract 
offered by the grantor, the grantor may have good cause to terminate, cancel, or fail to renew the relationship at the expiration of 
the original contract, provided the requirements imposed by the grantor are essential, reasonable and non-discriminatory. "

several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared illegal."" (emphasis added) HN7[
] The Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 3 provides in pertinent part: ""That it shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce . . . to . . . fix a price charged therefore, or discount from or 
rebate upon . . . where the effect of such lease, sale, or contract . . . may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to 
create a monopoly in any line of commerce."" (emphasis added)"
1001,9, Muzak's Post-Hearing Memorandum at p. 2. WMNI's Post-Hearing Memorandum at p. 2. 
1002,10," MTA Program, Section 1.7 provides in pertinent part: No Subscriber shall be added to the Multi-Territorial Account List without 
the prior written consent of the Affiliate in whose Muzak territory the headquarters of such Subscriber is located. Mr. Carroll, the attorney who represented the IPMA in its negotiations with Muzak, testified to a slight variation in how the 
program works in actual fact: "". . . the national account program contemplates that there will be a list prepared of accounts which the national account 
committee believes should be targeted for sales. The program then also contemplates that the list will be distributed among the 
franchisees and the franchisees have the ability to exclude from that list, to deny the national account committee the ability to go 
after any account that is inside their territory, headquartered inside their territory. (Carroll Deposition, P.27, L. 7-17)"
1002,11," § 1.7 defines the Assigned Person as "". . . the person or entity who is assigned responsibility for the multi-territory marketing 
of the Services to each such Multi-Territory Account, which person or entity shall in each case be either Muzak or the Affiliate 
licensed by Muzak to operate in the Muzak Territory in which the headquarters of the Multi-Territory Account are located."
1002,12," Even though §§ 1.7 and 2.1 are silent on the matter, the Court takes as fact Mr. Jester's testimony that Muzak becomes the 
Assigned Person only after the Affiliate has declined. ""The Affiliate gets to make that choice."" (Jester Hearing Testimony, P. 20, 
L. 21)"
1002,13, The provisions of MTA program are set forth in WMNI's Hearing Exhibit 5.
1002,14," Section 2.1 provides in pertinent part: ""Unless Licensee is the Assigned Person with respect to such Account, Licensee will 
not independently approach a Multi-Territory Account location for marketing purposes without the prior written consent of the 
Assigned Person."""
1002,15," Section 2.2 provides in pertinent part: ""The specific terms (pricing, length of contract, etc.) set forth in the Multi-Territory 
Account Contract with a specific Multi-Territory Account shall be as determined by the Committee subiect to section 3.2 below 
Licensee understands and agrees that, in performing its obligations and exercising its rights with respect to a Multi-Territory 
Contract, Licensee shall be bound by the terins set forth therein and shall have no right independently to amend or otherwise 
alter any such terms."""
1002,16," Section 9.1 of the new License Agreement provides in pertinent part: ""Licensee and Muzak agree to participate in the Multi-
Territory Accounts Program as set forth in Exhibit G and otherwise to abide by the terms of Exhibit G. Without limiting generality 
of the foregoing, Licensee agrees to participate during the term of this Agreement in all multi-territory contracts (as defined in 
Exhibit G) that pertain to subscriber prenlises in the territory."" "
1003,17," § 5.2 of the MTA Program provides in part: "" . . . an Affiliate operating from a Muzak territory that is ad)acent to the failing 
Affiliate's Muzak territory, as selected by the Committee, shall thereafter be authorized to perform the obligations and exercise 
the rights . . . under such contract."" See also Gould Testimony, P.46 L.20 to P.47 L.9."
1003,18," In Sealy the Seventh Circuit found that Sealy's National Accounts Program did not violate the antitrust laws. The Court stated: 
Any licensee was free not to participate, and to negotiate directly with the customer in an attempt to supply all or any part of the 
customer's needs. While a licensee was in the program, however, it was obligated to supply the customer's outlets in its APR 
with the specified products at the agreed price."" (emphasis added) Id. at 837. The Court further stated, ""Even though a licensee 
might originally elect to participate, it was perfectly at liberty at any time to withdraw from the program and to begin negotiations 
with the customer."" Id. at 837. While WMNI might seize upon the distinction that Muzak affiliates, while free to withdraw, may not 
compete where a valid MTA agreement exists, the Court is not persuaded that the MTA program's restriction on the time at 
which WMNI may compete, removes this case from the holding in Sealy. "

1004,21," ""This concern for the autonomy of independents grows in part from the view that competition at all levels of the distributive

independent businessman, the power to set his own price."" Id. at 656. "
1020,1," The majority does not address whether M & M proffered sufficient evidence to withstand summary judgment on its 
monopolization claim; it holds only that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the particular ground that Dr. 
Blair's affidavit was insufficient to support a conclusion that the Hospital possessed monopoly power in the relevant durable 
medical equipment [DME] market. The district court also did not consider whether Pleasant Valley had willfully acquired or 
maintained monopoly power, see M & M Medical Supplies & Serv. v. Pleasant Valley Hosp., Inc., 738 F. Supp. 1017, 1020 (S.D. 
W. Va. 1990). We may affirm summary judgment, however, on any ground apparent from the record, even if the basis chosen by 
the district court proves erroneous. See, e.g., Service & Training, Inc. v. Data Gen. Corp., 963 F.2d 680, 685 & n.10 (4th Cir. 
1992); cf.  Frey & Son, Inc. v. Cudahy Packing Co., 256 U.S. 208, 210-11, 65 L. Ed. 892, 41 S. Ct. 451 (1921). "

force competitors out of the market. See Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 584 n.8. "
1022,4," It is significant that the court therefore holds today that it is an anticompetitive practice to sell both at prices below  and above 
the competition. The only way to avoid antitrust liability, according to the majority, is to fix prices at the levels maintained by the 
competition, a practice that is itself suspect under the Sherman Act. "
1023,5," The court relies generally upon Advanced Health-Care as support for its holding. See ante at 10-11. For the reasons stated 
supra at 20-21, this case is easily distinguished from the case sub judice ."
1023,6," I would also hold that M & M's proffer is insufficient as a matter of law to establish genuine issues of material fact as to the 
other elements of an attempted monopolization claim -- namely, ""anticompetitive or predatory conduct"" and a ""dangerous 
probability of success."" Abcor, 916 F.2d at 926; see also Swift, 196 U.S. at 396. "

Antitrust Act ""has no criminal provisions with all of the attendant procedural safeguards."" "
1029,2," We note that the actions taken by the Attorney General prior to the filing of any civil antitrust complaint are investigatory. 
Perhaps the investigatory power of the Attorney General under W. Va. Code, 47-18-7(a) [1978] is best compared to the authority 
of an administrative agency to investigate prior to making any charges of a violation of the law. For example, in United States v. 
Morton Salt Co., 338 U.S. 632, 642, 70 S. Ct. 357, 364, 94 L. Ed. 401, 410-11 (1950), the United States Supreme Court 
discussed the duty of the Federal Trade Commission to inform itself and protect commerce against continued or renewed 
unlawful practice: The only power that is involved here is the power to get information from those who best can give it and who are most 
interested in not doing so. Because judicial power is reluctant if not unable to summon evidence until it is shown to be 
relevant to issues in litigation, it does not follow that an administrative agency charged with seeing that the laws are 
enforced may not have and exercise powers of original inquiry. It has a power of inquisition, if one chooses to call it that, 
which is not derived from the judicial function. It is more analogous to the [Investigative] Grand Jury, which does not depend 
on a case or controversy for power to get evidence but can investigate merely on suspicion that the law is being violated, or 
even just because it wants assurance that it is not. When investigative and accusatory duties are delegated by statute to an 
administrative body, it, too, may take steps to inform itself as to whether there is probable violation of the law."
1029,3," W. Va. Code, 47-18-10 [1978] provides: A final judgment rendered in any civil proceeding brought by the State for violation of this article to the effect that a 
defendant has violated said article shall be prima facie evidence against such defendant in any proceeding brought by any 
other party against such defendant pursuant to section eight [§ 47-18-8] of this article, as to all matters with respect to 
which said judgment of decree would be an estoppel as between the parties thereto: Provided, That this section shall not 
apply to consent judgments or decrees entered before any testimony has been taken. (emphasis added)."
1029,4," W. Va. Code, 47-18-12 [1978] provides, in relevant part: ""Whenever any civil proceeding shall be commenced by the State to 
prevent, restrain or punish a violation of this article, the running of the statute of limitations . . . shall be suspended during the 
pendency thereof and for one year thereafter[.]"""
1029,5," We note that the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa held, in State of Iowa v. Union Asphalt & 
Roadoils, Inc., 281 F. Supp. 391 (S.D. Iowa 1968), that an action for treble damages under the antitrust statutes is quasi-criminal 
in nature. However, in contrast, the United States Supreme Court has held, in Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 
485-86, 97 S. Ct. 690, 696, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701, 710 (1977), that the treble damages provision under the Clayton Act, which makes 
awards available only to injured parties in private antitrust actions, is designed primarily as a remedy. West Virginia's Antitrust 
Act, specifically W. Va. Code, 47-18-9 [1978], also allows private individuals to recover treble damages when injured by a 
violation of the Act. "
1030,," Furthermore, other courts have recognized that treble damages do not constitute a criminal penalty. The Court of Appeals for the 
Eighth Circuit in Crary v. Porter, 157 F.2d 410, 414 (8th Cir. 1946) explained the nature of treble damages: mere increased or multiple damages, whether they be for exemplary or other public-interest purposes, whose allowance is 
dependent upon the recovery of actual damages, have never been regarded as constituting a criminal penalty. See 15 Am. 
Jur., Damages, § 267, p. 703. A penalty in a sense they may well be, in their practical significance perhaps and to the 
defendant's mind no doubt, but in legal concept their allowance is simply an incident or part of the remedial sanction of 
damages.  Stockwell v. United States, 13 Wall. 531, 547, 80 U.S. 531, 547, 20 L. Ed. 491, put it thus: 'There are many 
cases in which a party injured is allowed to recover in a civil action double or treble damages. * * * It will hardly be claimed 
that these are penal actions requiring the application of different rules * * * from those that prevail in other actions for 
indemnity.' To whatever extent, therefore, that it may be argued that double or treble damages in a civil action amount to a 
penalty, they are, unless the statute otherwise indicates, a mere remedial sanction and do not in any way make the action 
subject to the rules or privileges of a criminal prosecution."
1030,6," The sanction's only ""restraint"" would involve injunctive relief to prevent or restrain violations of the Antitrust Act. W. Va. Code, 
47-18-8 [1978]. The courts may also ""grant injunctions reasonably necessary to restore and preserve competition in the trade or 
commerce affected by a violation of this article."" W. Va. Code, 47-18-8 [1978]."
1030,7," In Kimmelman, the Supreme Court of New Jersey, relying on the Ward decision, held that its per diem penalty for companies' 
participation in a price-fixing scheme under its Antitrust Act was civil, and not criminal, in nature."
1030,8," As for the damages received by private plaintiffs, see n. 5, supra."
1030,9," We point out that this factor alone would not be sufficient to render the statute quasi-criminal in light of the fact that the other 
factors support its characterization as a civil penalty. See Ward, 448 U.S. at 257, 100 S. Ct. at 2645, 65 L. Ed.2d at 755 
(Blackmun, J., concurring). "
1031,10," Under the Sherman Act, specifically 15 U.S.C. § 1 (1988), ""every person who shall make any contract or engage in any 
combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony[.]"" Furthermore, under 15 U.S.C. § 2 
(1988), ""every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, 
to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a 
felony[.]"""
1031,11," The United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia pointed out in Anziulewicz v. Bluefield Community 
Hospital, Inc., 531 F. Supp. 49, 53 (S.D. W. Va. 1981): ""Federal antitrust law is obviously directed toward interstate commerce. 
West Virginia's antitrust law is directed towards intrastate commerce."" (emphasis in original). Thus, we note that a violation of West Virginia's Antitrust Act may not necessarily give rise to a violation of the federal antitrust 
laws. "
1032,12," Olen Doddridge stated in his deposition that he asked the assistant attorney general, Donna Quesenberry, if he needed to 
have a lawyer present for his deposition, and that she responded ""You can if you want, but you don't have to have."""
1032,13," We note that it does not appear from the record before us that any of the appellees invoked their Fifth Amendment privilege 
against self-incrimination, or that they were compelled to testify against themselves. However, we point out that some of the 
appellees in this case are business entities which have no privilege against self-incrimination. Hyster Company v. United States, 
338 F.2d 183 (9th Cir. 1964). See also Shim v. Kikkoman International Corp, 509 F. Supp. 736 (D.N.J. 1981). We further point 
out that the fifth amendment privilege does not extend to the contents of documents which are obtained by compulsory process 
where such documents have been voluntarily prepared. Syl. pt. 9, Marano v. Holland, 179 W. Va. 156, 366 S.E.2d 117 (1988). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit best explained the privilege against self-incrimination in antitrust cases in 
In re Corrugated Container Anti-Trust Litigation, 620 F.2d 1086, 1091-92 (5th Cir. 1980): The fifth amendment provides that 'no person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself. . . 
.' This privilege against compulsory self-incrimination 'can be asserted in any proceeding, civil or criminal, administrative or 
judicial, investigatory or adjudicatory . . . .' Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 444, 92 S. Ct. 1653, 1656, 32 L. Ed.2d 
212 (1972). A witness may properly invoke the privilege when he 'reasonably apprehends a risk of self-incrimination, . . . 
though no criminal charges are pending against him, . . . and even if the risk of prosecution is remote.' Wehling v. Columbia 
Broadcasting System, 608 F.2d 1084, 1087 n. 5 (5th Cir. 1979) (citations omitted). The Wehling test indicates that a court must ordinarily make two inquiries to determine whether a witness is entitled to 
assert the privilege and refuse to respond to questioning. First, the court must determine whether answers to the questions 
might tend to reveal that the witness has engaged in criminal activities. If the answers could not be incriminatory, the 
witness must answer.  Zicarelli v. New Jersey State Commission of Investigation, 406 U.S. 472, 92 S. Ct. 1670, 32 L. Ed.2d 
234 (1972). If answering the questions might incriminate the witness, the court must next ask whether there is a risk, even a 
remote risk, that the witness will be prosecuted for the criminal activities that his testimony might touch on. As the Seventh 
Circuit recently observed: [This determination does not depend] upon a judge's prediction of the likelihood of prosecution. Rather, . . . it is only when 
there is but a fanciful possibility of prosecution that a claim of fifth amendment privilege is not well taken. . . . When a 
witness can demonstrate any possibility of prosecution which is more than fanciful he has demonstrated a reasonable fear 
of prosecution sufficient to meet constitutional muster. In re Folding Carton Antitrust Litigation, 609 F.2d 867, 871 (7th Cir. 1979) (citations omitted). The Sixth Circuit further pointed out, however, that even if a witness establishes a reasonable fear of self-incrimination and 
prosecution, he or she may be compelled to testify if he or she is granted ""use"" immunity pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 6001-6003. 
See 15 U.S.C. § 1312(7)(B) (1988)."
1032,14," We note that Galigher Ford, Inc. and Jacob C. Rardin, IV, assert that ""it is obvious that the State Attorney General used this 
particular civil litigation as a forum for his unsuccessful bid for the Democratic gubernatorial candidacy."" (emphasis added). We 
find nothing ""obvious"" in the record to support this bald assertion of conjecture. "
1033,15," David Lynn Geer, Royce Dale Geer and Geer Brothers Body Shop, Inc. alleged in their brief that because autobody [sic] repairs are underwritten by insurance companies, it is suspected that the Attorney General had 
become a 'tool' of the insurance companies, who was being used by them to benefit their 'bottom lines' at the expense of 
the autobody [sic] repair industry. In their zeal to perform this function for the insurance industry, the Attorney General and 
his assistants ignored their ethical obligations as attorneys and trampled the rights of the small, relatively unsophisticated 
businesses involved. (emphasis added). The record is devoid of any evidence to support these speculative assertions."
1033,16," The Antitrust Civil Process Act empowers the Attorney General or the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust 
Division of the Department of Justice, to issue, prior to the initiation of any civil or criminal proceeding, a demand for 
documentary material relevant to a civil antitrust investigation.  United States v. International Business Machines Corp., 83 
F.R.D. 97 (S.D.N.Y. 1979); 15 U.S.C. § 1312 (1988). The purpose of the civil investigation demand procedure under the Antitrust 
Civil Process Act is to allow the antitrust division to investigate antitrust violations without prematurely becoming involved in a 
full-blown litigation.  Associated Container Transportation (Australia) Ltd. v. United States, 502 F. Supp. 505 (S.D.N.Y. 1980)."
1033,17," The court also held in Gold Bond that the power granted the Attorney General under the federal antitrust statute did not 
violate the search and seizure clause of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. The Ninth Circuit reached the same 
conclusion in Hyster Company v. United States, 338 F.2d 183 (1964) (civil investigative demand under Antitrust Civil Process 
Act is not unreasonable search and seizure in violation of Fourth Amendment to the Constitution). "
1034,18," It is not clear to this Court why the circuit court dismissed this case with prejudice, although the circuit court sharply criticized 
the Attorney General's conduct during the investigation. The motions before the circuit court were not for summary judgment 
pursuant to W. Va. R. Civ. P. 56, which would be a dismissal with prejudice. However, the State points out that, although the 
motions were designated as motions to dismiss, they brought in matters outside the pleadings and therefore, became motions 
for summary judgment. We point out that a judgment sustaining a motion to dismiss under W. Va. R. Civ. P. 12(b) would be a 
dismissal without prejudice."
1034,19," Because we are reversing this case, we do not address the issue raised by the State regarding the circuit court's 
consideration of certain affidavits. "
1040,1," The Honorable James T. Moody, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Indiana, is sitting by designation. "
1043,1," The Ricci Court did not decide what procedure to follow if the plaintiff did not seek agency review or if that review is no longer 
available. Wigod did not seek agency review of either the trade-dispute arbitration or the Merc's failure to enforce the audit-trail "
1044,," rules, and although Wigod did seek agency review of the disciplinary hearing, he did it 20 months late and the CFTC refused to 
excuse the delay or consider the merits of Wigod's allegations. Commission Rule 9.21. Also, the CFTC did not institute review of 
the Merc's conduct. In American Agricultural Movement, Inc. v. The Board of Trade of the City of Chicago, No. 91-2845, 1992 
WL 295523, we stated that if the reviewing agency has discretion over what actions it can choose to review, then that 
discretionary authority may not be enough to shield the regulatory actions from antitrust scrutiny. If the discretion is historically 
exercised to the degree that no review is an implicit approval of the action, then antitrust immunity may attach. We explained that 
agency decisions are not the final authority when determining what facially anticompetitive practices will be immunized from 
antitrust liability pursuant to the authority granted in CEA. We, however, do not have to decide whether the absence of CFTC 
review bears implicit meaning for two reasons. First, the district court did not invoke the primary jurisdiction doctrine to defer 
consideration of the case when the issue was raised in the motion to dismiss. Second, the denial of the motion to dismiss was 
not appealed. "
1045,2," Each rule states in relevant part: Section 6g: (1) Every person registered hereunder as futures commission merchant or floor broker shall make such reports as 
are required by the Commission regarding the transactions and positions of the customer thereof . . . . (2) Every clearinghouse and contract market shall maintain daily trading records. The daily trading records shall include such 
information as the Commission shall prescribe by rule. (3) Floor brokers and futures commission merchants shall maintain daily trading records for each customer in such manner and 
form as to be identifiable with the trades referred to in paragraph (2) of this section. Rule 512 Every trader and broker shall have the responsibility of aiding his respective clearing firm in the clearing of his trades. It 
shall be the duty of every trader and broker to record each trade he makes during the day showing his own name or symbol, the 
name of the member firm clearing the trade, the date, price, quantity, commodity, contract month, Exchange required time 
designation, the opposite broker and opposite clearing member. . . . By the end of the trading session, the record of all 
transactions shall be submitted to the respective clearing members for which or through which the trader or broker has made 
trades during the session. . . . Rule 536 RECORD OF CUSTOMERS' ORDERS AND MEMBERS' PERSONAL TRANSACTIONS. . . . All orders and all 
personal transactions of members must, at the time of execution, be recorded by the executing broker or trader on either the 
order form or personal trading card as the case may be. Such record must indicate the date, commodity, contract, month, 
quantity, price, strike price, if applicable, Exchange required time designation and opposite clearing member and broker. 
Violation of any of the foregoing may constitute a major offense. By the end of the trading session the personal record of each member's transaction shall be submitted to the respective clearing 
member through which the trades are to be cleared. Such personal records as well as all customer orders (whether filled, 
unfilled, or canceled) shall be retained by the said clearing member for at least five years. The President or his representative may require immediate proof of compliance with this rule. "
1047,3," Wigod calls our attention to CFTC regulations that encompass the same behavior covered by Exchange Rules 512 and 536. 
He apparently uses these regulations as examples of the duty imposed on Alpert to report and the Merc's bad faith in not 
enforcing reporting requirements and discrediting the trade. We do not perceive his argument as seeking an implied private right 
of action for damages resulting from the alleged CFTC regulation violations. "
1048,4," The statute states in relevant part: (b) Liabilities of organizations and individuals; bad faith requirement; exclusive remedy (1)(A) A contract market or clearing organization of a contract market that fails to enforce any bylaw, rule, regulation, or 
resolution that it is required to enforce by section 7a(8) and (9) of this title . . . shall be liable for actual damages sustained by a 
person who engaged in any transaction on or subject to the rules of such contract market or licensed board of trade to the extent 
of such person's actual losses that resulted from such transaction and were caused by such failure to enforce or enforcement of 
such bylaws, rules, regulations, or resolutions. "
1058,1," The court is not adopting any of Judge Jarvey's disputed factual findings. Those findings were made in connection with a 
hearing on issuance of a preliminary injunction. Although this court adopted Judge Jarvey's Report and Recommendation, those 
findings on disputed issues of material fact are given no consideration in this decision on the cross motions for summary 
judgment. The evidentiary record made as part of the preliminary injunction hearing has been relied upon by both sides in 
arguing their respective positions on the issues raised in the summary judgment motions. "
1067,2," Dr. Islami does not argue that the hearing he received subsequent to the imposition of the second opinion requirement is 
deficient in any way. The arguments about the deficiency of the hearing relate exclusively to the hearing on the suspension. "
1068,3," The defendants also have argued that Dr. Islami is not entitled to summary judgment on his breach of contract claim because 
Dr. Islami breached the agreement first when he failed to provide professional medical care as provided under the bylaws. The 
court need not reach that issue here as it already has found that there are genuine issues of material and that summary 
judgment is not appropriate. Moreover, at a minimum there are genuine factual issues about whether Dr. Islami breached the 
bylaws at all. "
1071,4," The court notes here that if it decided that the procedures provided to Dr. Islami were fair under the circumstance and granted 
summary judgment on the immunity issue, that effectively would decide the entire case. That finding would give the defendants 
immunity from liability on the damages claims raised under the breach of contract action, the antitrust law action, the intentional 
infliction of emotional distress action, and the intentional interference with a business relation action. Likewise, a finding that the "
1072,," procedures were fair under the circumstances would effectively conclude that the procedures were sufficient under the contract 
as well and that Dr. Islami could not continue to pursue his reinstatement claim. "
1077,5," The extent of the review performed by Covenant's Board of Directors of the Executive Committee's decision in this case 
provides further evidence of the Executive Committee's decisionmaking power in this case. The Covenant Board of Directors 
specifically noted that it was not going to review the merits of the case or take any additional evidence. Instead, the board limited 
its review to the question of fair process only. "
1089,1," The following passage in the Yellow Bus Lines court's opinion may also give one pause: ""We see no logical reason why a 
union attempting to gain recognition from a company is any more participating in the conduct of the company's affairs than is any "
1090,," other external entity attempting to contract with the putative enterprise."" 913 F.2d at 955. One might initially suppose that 
Henwood and Results were merely ""external entities attempting to contract with"" EEI. The court's point, however, was that an 
entity's mere attempt to contract with an enterprise does not, by itself, constitute participation in the conduct of the enterprise's 
affairs. But the allegations reveal that Henwood and Results did much more than attempt to contract with EEI: they exerted 
control over EEI's actual decisions through a sophisticated bribery scheme."
1090,2," At least one court has applied the Eighth Circuit's RICO participation standard from Bennett v. Berg (adopted by this Court of 
Appeals in Yellow Bus Lines) to facts involving potential bribery. In United States v. Kaye, 586 F. Supp. 1395 (N.D. Ill. 1984), 
the defendant had worked one day per month as a part-time holiday court bailiff, although he was not employed by the court. 
The defendant had solicited and received money for the asserted purpose of influencing judges, but had never delivered any 
money to the judges. Judge Shadur applied the Bennett standard and dismissed the count, concluding that the defendant had 
not ""participated in the conduct"" of the court's affairs because he had not delivered any money to the judges or influenced the 
court. Id. at 1400. Under the reasoning of Kaye, if the acts of bribery had been consummated -- as they were in the instant case 
-- the participation requirement would have been met. "
1091,3," HN12[

accept, anything of value as a commission, brokerage, or other compensation, or any allowance or discount in lieu thereof, 
except for services rendered in connection with the sale or purchase of goods, wares, or merchandise, either to the other party 
to such transaction or to an agent, representative, or other intermediary therein where such intermediary is acting in fact for or in 
behalf, or is subject to the direct or indirect control, of any party to such transaction other than the person by whom such 
compensation is granted or paid."

1096,1," Immediately after Magistrate Fonseca granted defendants' request for limited discovery, counsel for defendants contacted 
plaintiff's counsel to arrange for the depositions of eight witnesses during the time period allowed by the Magistrate for limited "
1097,," discovery. See Defendants' exhibit B, Letter from Henry Kinney to Brad Adams (12/16/92). Counsel for plaintiff responded that 
he would be available for deposition on December 28, 1992, but that it would be ""difficult to schedule"" the depositions of the 
other witnesses because ""it is now close to the Christmas holidays and schedules become quite tight."" See Defendants' exhibit 
B, Letter from Brad Adams to Henry Kinney (12/16/92). This correspondence illustrates the insufficiency of the time period 
allowed by the magistrate for limited discovery. "
1105,1," There is also some support for the proposition that even without market power vertical restraints may reduce interbrand

added)."
1109,11," Heileman, Miller, Coors and Genesee all have adopted exclusive territories for distribution in New York State. The State has 
never challenged the exclusive territories of Coors and Genesee, and has settled all claims against Miller and Heileman without

1110,14, Paragraph 1 read:
1110,1," . Territory (a) Anheuser-Busch and Wholesaler recognize and agree that it is essential to their mutual objectives under this Agreement that 
Wholesaler at all times maintain the financial and competitive capabilities necessary to achieve efficient and effective distribution 
of Anheuser-Busch Products in Wholesaler's sales area and to assure continued protection of the high quality and integrity of 
Anheuser-Busch Products. In order to: (i) enable Anheuser-Busch and Wholesaler to more effectively compete with the products of other brewers in Wholesaler's 
sales area; (ii) assure that the quality and integrity of Anheuser-Busch Products are constantly maintained recognizing that such 
Products are perishable, that it is vitally important that over-age Products no be permitted to reach consumers and that 
such Products must at all times be handled properly; (iii) induce and enable Wholesaler to make such investments in its operation and facilities as may be necessary or 
appropriate to maintain and enhance efficiency and effectiveness in Wholesaler's overall marketing efforts; (iv) induce and enable Wholesaler to engage in marketing, advertising and promotional efforts in Wholesaler's sales area, 
provide full customer services, achieve maximum representation of all Anheuser-Busch Products in all licensed accounts in 
Wholesaler's sales area and actively promote and aggressively market the full range of Anheuser-Busch Products which 
are the subject of this agreement; (v) assure that Wholesaler develops and maintains adequate and effective local community relation and exercises full 
responsibility to the community in its operations; (vi) foster, promote and maintain an efficient, viable and financially sound system of distribution of Anheuser-Busch 
Products to the benefit of Anheuser-Busch, its wholesalers and all purchasers of the Products; and (vii) facilitate and enable compliance by Wholesaler with the Operating, Sales and Merchandising Standards . . . (Def.Ex. A-A)."
1110,15," In fact, some home distributors, like State's witnesses Mr. Stella and Mr. Misciagna, will not allow A-B employees into their 
warehouses to inspect for overage beer. (Tr. 414-415, 1263-1265). "
1111,16," One way to establish new or smaller volume brands is through multiple package distribution, whereby the price of a lesser 
brand is discounted upon purchase of a major brand, like Budweiser. The harm done by transshipping to multiple brand sales in 
clearly exemplified in New York. In the Metropolitan area, where transshipping is most prominent, Budweiser accounts for 87% 
of the A-B products sold, whereas nationally Budweiser only accounts for approximately 53% of the A-B's sales. (Tr. 2060)."
1111,17," There are several different levels of beer prices. ""Freight-on-board"" (""FOB"") price refers to the price a brewer charges its 
authorized wholesalers; ""price-to-retailer"" (""PTR"") refers to the frontline price a distributor chargers to a retailer or home 
distributor; ""price-to-consumer"" (""PTC"") is what a retailer charges the consumer."
1111,18," The State's case was severely hampered by a lack of expert economic testimony in their case-in-chief. Professor W. John 
Jordan was to be the State's only expert witness, but was not called because ""his testimony would aid neither the Court nor the 
State."" (Tr. 1542). The only expert economic testimony was that of rebuttal witness Professor Ralph Bradburd of Williams 
College, an economist with little previous exposure to the beer industry. "
1112,19," The Professor arrived at this figure by using the dollar amount of credits paid by A-B to wholesalers for overage beer found 
during a 1983 A-B conducted ""general sweep"" of the New York Metropolitan area to calculate a total number of overage beers in 
the Metro area. (Pl.Ex. 173). Using this figure with the total A-B sales in the entire Metro area, the Professor produced the 1 in 
200 ratio. This calculation assumes that (1) the 1983 ""general sweep"" visited all 20,311 accounts (unlikely in light of the fact that 
another ""sweep"" conducted in 1985, A-B visited only 3,953 of the 20,311 accounts existing in the Metro region [Pl.Ex. 102]), and 
(2) that the ""sweep"" found every overage beer in the Metro region. The Professor admitted that if either of those two 
assumptions is faulty his figure that 1 in 200 cases are overage is erroneously low. (Tr. 3817-3818)."
1112,20," The unsoundness of the State's assertion was best exemplified by testimony of Professor Bradburd. The Professor testified 
that when stored long enough the taste of beer changes. He then testified that when he drank a beer whose taste he did not like, 
even though he was unsure whether the bad taste was because the beer was overage or because he simply did not like the 
taste of that brand, he (like any other consumer) would stop buying that product. (Tr. 3780-3781)."
1112,21," Even Professor Bradburd admitted that it is a legitimate business objective to take steps to ensure that overage beer does not 
reach customers. "
1113,22," As a result of the CEW requirement, A-B was able to raise Budweiser's freshness period from 90 to 105 days. (Tr. 2015)."
1113,23," The wholesaler coding also assisted with determining if a wholesaler was servicing out-of-territory accounts to whom a 
wholesaler's product was sold, as required by A-B. The State argues that the wholesaler coding and the out-of-territory account 
servicing were aimed at further reducing transshipping. Not only did A-B offer valid business purposes for imposing such 
requirements, namely protection of product quality, but that purpose was validated by one of the State's own witnesses, Peter 
Enzien, an A-B wholesaler who has continued transhipping to this day testified that it was ""totally legitimate"" for A-B to institute 
these policies to protect its product. (Tr. 1840-1841)."
1113,24," As will be discussed, infra, if A-B truly intended to eliminate transshipping it easily could have behaved as many of its 
competitors have and imposed ""air tight"" exclusive territories."
1113,25, Professor Jerry A. Hausman is a professor of economics at M.I.T. who has also studied the beer industry extensively. 
1114,26," Eugene Vukelic operates Try-It Distributors, an A-B authorized wholesaler in Buffalo; Frank Parker operates Sound 
Distributing, an A-B authorized wholesaler in the Bronx; Peter Enzien operates Boland Distributors, and A-B authorized 
wholesaler in Troy."
1114,27," These increased activities include: hiring additional personnel, purchasing additional trucks, installing phones and computers, 
repairs and improvements of existing facilities and vehicles, uniforms, fork lifts, and community relations. Increased services 
brought on closer personal contact with customers, supplying point-of-sale materials, use of route books and monitoring product 
freshness. The extent to which enormous investments were essential to operating a successful wholesalership was vividly 
demonstrated during the Court's visit to the Clare Rose wholesalership."
1114,28," The State argued that A-B wholesaler performance reports were not introduced to prove improved performance. Nevertheless, 
as discussed above, all three wholesalers who testified at trial stated that wholesaler performance improved after the 
amendments. "
1115,29," The State arrived at this figure solely by citing an estimate from a document created by A-B. Although the Court does not find 
the evidence supporting this figure entirely persuasive, the defendant was unable or unwilling to propose a counter figure. The 
Court will accept the 12 million case figure as the most likely level of transshipping in 1982."
1115,30," The State offered very little evidence to support its claims regarding the level of transshipping. Professor Bradburd's testimony 
was introduced under the guise of rebutting the defendant's experts. Instead, State has attempted to use the Professor's 
testimony to establish affirmatively certain facts that should have been is introduced in their case-in-chief. Further, estimates 
taken from documents created by A-B employees, although somewhat persuasive, are merely estimates. (Pl.Ex. 102, 295514). 
The State's inability to offer more than testimony from a few transshippers and a rebuttal witness is an unstable foundation upon 
which to build a case."
1115,31," At his deposition, Mr. Jay Heimowitz of United Beverage testified to being told by A-B counsel that sales to transshippers who 
sell out-of-territory ""would be fine."" (Pl.Ex. 388, Heimowitz Dep. at 18, 76). Mr. Richard Monsees of Port Distributing, Mr. Joseph 
DeMarco of Rutgers Distributors, and Mr. Joseph Raso of Raso Beer Distributors all testified to understanding that the ""indirect 
sales"" clause permitted any in-territory sale, even to a transshipper. (Pl.Ex. 398, Monsees Dep. at 33; Pl.Ex. 381, DeMarco Dep. 
at 83; Pl.Ex. 401, Raso Dep. at 75-77). Mr. Peter Enzien of Boland Distributors testified that he feared being terminated if he did 
not cease all sales to transshipping home distributors, but was told by A-B counsel prior to the execution of the 1982 
amendments that ""if goods were transshipped from one market to another market by a legitimate purchaser within your own 
market, that would be -- would not be ground for termination, as long as the sale was not a sham or frivolous."" (Tr. at 1473). 
Nevertheless, Mr. Enzien ceased transshipping on January 1, 1983. (Tr. 1474). But, by the end of 1983, Mr. Enzien's sales to 
transshippers revived and by 1990 he sold 5.2 million cases of A-B to transshipping seller, Thruway Beverage. (Def.Ex. AB-VR)."
1115,32," The only allegedly punitive acts by A-B were the withholding of certain products from wholesalers. Mr. Enzien of Boland 
testified that A-B stopped making 8 oz. cans of Budweiser available to him from 1982-1986. (Tr. 1720-1723). The 40 oz. bottles 
of Budweiser were never available to him or Kiamesha Lake wholesalers. Pl.Ex. 463. The State offered no proof that A-B 
withheld such products punitively or that A-B had an obligation to supply all its wholesalers with all of A-B's product line. "
1116,33," A second factor in the reduction of transshipping following the 1982 amendments was the fact that authorized A-B 
wholesalers, like Mr. Enzien, who had been participating in transshipping themselves, without use of a third party, no longer took 
part in the practice in that active capacity."
1116,34," Calculations made by the State based on a document created by A-B employees estimates that beer transshipped from 
outside the Metro region accounted for 41% of total Metro A-B sales in 1982, but had dropped to 19% in 1983. (Pl.Ex. 102, at 
295514). State's rebuttal witness Bradburd estimated that by 1986 that figure had risen to 29%, and to 33% in 1990. (Pl.Ex. 
628)."
1116,35," The one State's home distributor witness who relied on a singular supplier for A-B products, Nicholas Misciagna, has had just 
the one supplier since 1978, four years before the implementation of the amendments in question."
1116,36," These witnesses, Carmine Stella, Robert Vlasaty. Steve Rosenthal and Nicholas Misciagna, are all home distributors who 
have opposed the 1982 amendments since its inception. Each is a member of the both the Empire State Beer Distributors 
Association and the Independent Beverage Distributors Alliance. Both groups that have vigorously opposed the A-B and the 
1982 amendments, in fact, the sole purpose of the ""Alliance"" is to ""coordinate and manage. . . . anticipated litigation against A-
B"". (Tr. 336-337)."
1116,37," Mr. Vlasaty of Vasilow Distributors decided to close his business a couple of weeks before the Equity Agreement became 
effective, after his authorized wholesaler, Raso Beer Distributors, informed that he could no longer sell to Vasilow due to the new 
Equity Agreement. Mr. Vlasaty, never submitted an order that was turned down and had he inquired prior to terminating his 
business, he may have learned that Raso was permitted to sell to him under the Equity Agreement. "
1117,38," Messrs. Stella, Rosenthal and Misciagna all testified to the prosperity of their businesses after the 1982 amendments. (Tr. 
141, 367-370, 942-944, 1184-1185, 1218-1219). Mr. Vlasaty decided to close his distributorship before the effective date of the 
1982 amendments. (Tr. 697-698)."
1117,39," Even if that was A-B's purpose, due to the free-riding of the home distributor transshippers on the efforts of A-B and the 
authorized wholesalers, that purpose would not necessarily be an illegal one."
1117,40," The Court finds it ironic that to support its case based on a contention that the 1982 Agreement injured transshippers the State 
called as witnesses home distributors who have prospered since the introduction of the Agreement. "
1118,41," State's witnesses Mr. Rosenthal and Mr. Misciagna rarely ever bought A-B products at the frontline price, and Mr. Enzien 
testified that only 1% of his sales were made at frontline prices. (Tr. 1026-1027, 1262, 1883-1885)."
1118,42," Mr. Parker testified that all of his sales were made at a discount, while Mr. Hunter stated that 90% of all sales in the State of A-
B beer were made at other than the frontline price. (Tr. 2815-2816, 2124)."
1118,43," Assuming frontline prices were the appropriate measuring tool, the State still failed to show that such an increase was causally 
related to the allegedly illegal terms in the 1982 equity agreement and not the other factors listed, infra."
1118,44," The impact of this evidence is tempered by the fact that it is based upon the testimony of only four home distributors, out of the 
approximately 500 in the State."
1118,45," Part of this increase was due not to an price increase by A-B, but rather to home distributors changing wholesale suppliers. 
Those home distributors who purchased beer directly from a transshipping authorized wholesaler were forced to find a new 
supplier after the 1982 Agreement. When these distributors changed wholesaler, the price they paid was sometimes higher. (Tr. 
794-796, 807-808, 886; 293-296). "
1119,46," Of the thirty-four authorized wholesalers in New York, the State relied on the financial statements of only five."
1119,47, It is unclear what role the Deposit Law had in these increased profit margins. See infra.
1119,48," Lacking such proof, it does not necessarily follow that consumers would in fact incur this expense. One way home distributors 
remain competitive is by pricing themselves at or below the price offered by an authorized wholesaler. Thus, it is possible that 
the increased cost could have merely taken a portion of the home distributor's profit margin rather than have been passed onto 
the consumer. (Tr. 1116). Nevertheless, there was testimony that such a cost would be passed on to the consumers. (Tr. 817)."
1119,49," The Deposit Law required distributors to charge 5 cents or more on each container sold. The consumer is charged 5 cents 
upon purchase but is also entitled to the 5 cents upon return of the empty container to any seller of that product. The authorized 
wholesalers must pay the redeemer of the empty container the 5 cents for each returned container, plus a 1.5 cent per-beer 
handling fee (totalling $ 1.56 in compliance cost added to each case of beer)."
1119,50," Another factor which indisputably increased consumer prices was the rise in beer taxes between 1982 and 1990. In the 1982-
1990 period, the federal excise tax on beer increased from $ .6532 per case equivalent (""C/E"") to $ 1.3064 per C/E. The New 
York State excise tax increased $ .373 per case from 1982 to 1990. The New York City excise tax has remained unchanged at $ 
.27 per C/E. In total, in 1982 a case of A-B beer was taxed $ 1.0232, while by 1990 this tax was up to $ 2.0494. "
1120,51," A-B waited until the advent of the bottle bill to invoke a substantial F.O.B. price increase. (Tr. 1274; Def.Ex. AB-L at 38071-
38074). The State argues that A-B's purpose behind the delay was to enable themselves to blame the bottle bill for the entire 
price increase, while A-B offers the business rationale of not desiring to raise prices twice in one year. In light of the above 
evidence, the State did not adequately show that the Deposit Law was not responsible for a large proportion the 1983 price 
increase or that the Defendant's suggested purpose was illusory."
1120,52, The direct cost of brewing Budweiser is lower in Baldwinsville than in Newark.
1120,53," This assertion is supported by a showing that from 1982-1986 the FOB prices of all A-B products in New York exceeded their 
average variable costs."
1120,54," Professor Bradburd stated his belief that A-B was a price leader. As a rebuttal expert, however, his testimony is technically not 
offered to assist the State's case-in-chief."
1120,55," Mr. Misciagna of MHS Distributors testified that beer was extremely price sensitive and a rise in prices of one dollar per case 
would result in an extreme loss in sales. Mr. Dunn of Stewart Stores testified not only of the inverse relationship between 
Budweiser prices and sales, but also that Budweiser is more price sensitive today than it was before the 1982 amendments. "
1121,56," The witness, Mr. Dunn of Stewart Stores gave credible testimony in reference to the effect of prices upon beer sold out of 
Stewart Stores. His testimony regarding the distribution of A-B beer, however, is entirely discounted by the Court due to his lack 
of knowledge of the usual distribution process in New York State. Stewart Stores are unique participants in the beer market, 
rendering Mr. Dunn's experiences in variance with all other market participants."
1121,57," The State has asserted throughout the trial that establishing a relevant geographic market is unnecessary for this case. All of 
the State's claims regarding relevant geographic market discussed, supra, were made in the alternative to this assertion. The 
Court's ruling regarding this assertion is discussed, infra."
1121,58," For instance, the State proposed a statewide market up until the first day of trial when counsel drew a line between Oswego 
and Binghamton, and stated that the region east of that line was the relevant market."
1121,59," Dr. Myslinski's stated, ""it seems to me we could divide the A-B wholesalers in New York into two groups. I call them upstate 
and downstate"" (Tr. 3131); and that ""the record is clear that the State is not one large market. That is a pretty clear-cut 
conclusion."" (Tr. 3077). Dr. Hausman testified that "". . . there was not one relevant geographic market, and in fact, there were 
numerous geographic markets"" (Tr. 3307-3308, 3316), and ""my conclusion as I sit here today is that there are at least the four 
relevant markets."" (Tr. 3351-3354). "
1122,60," The State argued that transshipping was occurring ""all over the State,"" (Tr. 133-134), but the bulk of the evidence revealed 
otherwise. Although isolated instances of transshipping outside of the Metropolitan area could be pointed to, the great majority of 
evidence put on by the State itself centered on transshipping in the Metropolitan area. Evidence of a few minor instances of non-
Metropolitan area transshipping and unsubstantiated opinion testimony was insufficient to lead this Court into believing that 
transshipping was active throughout the State."
1122,61," In Metropolitan New York, Genesee has a .21% market share; in Buffalo that share increases to 13.6%. "
1123,62," We note that the statements offered, even if admissible, would not have effected the Court's decision. The State claims that 
the statements confirm its allegations that the 1982 Equity Agreement forbade sales to transshippers. The statements in 
question may confirm A-B's suggestion that there was confusion by wholesalers concerning the ""indirect sales"" clause, but add 
little to support the theory that A-B prohibited sales to transshippers, who in turn sold the products out-of-territory. "
1124,63," Plaintiff also offered F.T.C. v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445, 106 S. Ct. 2009 (1986), in 
support of its contention. In Indiana, a horizontal restraint case, the Supreme Court did not undertake an in-depth analysis of the 
market boundaries and any resulting market power, ""since the purpose of the inquiries into market definition and market power is 
to determine whether an arrangement has the potential for genuine adverse effects on competition, proof of actual detrimental 
effects, such as reduction of output, can obviate the need for an inquiry into market power, which is but a 'surrogate' for 
detrimental effects."" Id. at 460-461. In short, Indiana holds that if the alleged horizontal restraint involves a naked restraint or 
patently offensive conduct which is clearly anticompetitive, inquiry into the market definition is unnecessary. Unlike the scenario in Indiana, where the defendant did not offer any credible evidence of the horizontal restraint's pro-
competitive nature, A-B has shown numerous credible procompetitive benefits gained from their vertically imposed policy. In 
fact, the Supreme Court in Sylvania by recognizing the benefits that often accompany vertically imposed restraints, in essence 
established that the inherent nature of the vertical restraint will rarely permit it to be so patently anticompetitive. The strong 
language in Sylvania recognizing the benefits of vertical territorial restrictions clearly indicates that it would be rare that the 
endorser of a vertical restraint would be unable to show some valid procompetitive benefits. Thus, unlike the horizontal restraint 
in question in Indiana, most vertical restraints will not be so manifestly anticompetitive that they can be found illegal without 
inquiry into the market definition. Possibly, only a vertical case similar to Eiberger, where no credible competitive benefits of the 
policy were shown, could the requirement of in-depth market analysis in a vertical non-price restraint case be unnecessary."
1124,64," While Sylvania did not explicitly require proof of market definition, the Court not only began its decision with recognition of the 
relevant geographic and product markets. 433 U.S. at 38, but also stated that HN8[
] ""antitrust policy divorced from market 
considerations would lack any objective benchmarks."" Id. at 53 n.21."
1124,65," The State's claim that proof of a relevant market is unnecessary belies the practical application of the rule of reason. HN9[
] 
The rule of reason requires the balancing of anticompetitive harms against the procompetitive benefits. In different geographic 
markets a restraint will have different effects. For example, in the present case, transshipping was abundant in the New York 
Metropolitan area but scarce in the rest of New York State. The State's case is based on the allegedly anticompetitive effect the 
1982 Equity Agreement had on transshipping. Clearly, due to the starkly disparate levels of transshipping across the State, the 
1982 Equity Agreement effects on the beer market must have been starkly disparate in different regions of the State. (Def.Ex. 
AB-AFT, Myslinski Report at 65, 68). Proof of a relevant market enables the Court's analysis to maintain a coherent structure. 
Without such proof the reasonableness of the restraint will fluctuate as the anticompetitive effects and procompetitive benefits 
vary throughout the State. The result of the plaintiff's assertion would be the imposition of the Court's ruling on a region where 
the restraint may have been perfectly reasonable because of an unreasonable finding in another region. "
1125,66," The State initially took the position that the relevant market was the entire State of New York, and maintained that position 
through discovery. It was from this position that the defendant's experts gave their ultimate opinions. When the State altered its 
position during opening arguments and in its motion to dismiss, it offered no expert testimony to support such a finding."
1125,67," See, Ginsburg, Vertical Restraints: De Facto Legality Under the Rule of Reason, 60 Antitrust L.J. 67, 72-73 (1991). "
1126,68," The ""hybrid"" case is Dimidowich v. Bell & Howell, 803 F.2d 1473 (9th Cir. 1986), in which upon reversing a summary judgment 
motion, the defendant had only 10-15% of the primary market, but possessed a virtual monopoly on the secondary market, the 
service of its products. The Court's decision appears to hinge on the possession of monopoly power in the service market. The 
case is much like Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc., 119 L. Ed. 2d 265, 112 S. Ct. 2072 (1992), in which the 
Supreme Court distinguished the facts from those in Sylvania, stating that, ""unlike Continental T.V., this case does not concern 
vertical relationships between parties on different levels of the same distribution chain."""
1126,69," Ginsberg, Vertical Restraints: De Facto Legality Under the Rule of Reason, 60 Antitrust L.J. at 72-73. Judge Ginsberg states 
that ""the plaintiff seems to have prevailed in [Eiberger] only because the court erred . . ."" in not giving serious consideration to 
the interbrand benefits of the vertical restraint. This failure "". . . can perhaps best be explained by the early date at which it was 
decided."" The Court in Eiberger held in response to defendant's argument that the plaintiff must show anticompetitive effects on the 
industry as a whole (or in other words show intrabrand harm plus market power), ""unless we are to conclude that an 
anticompetitive impact on intrabrand competition cannot alone support a finding that § 1 has been violated--and we see no basis 
for such a conclusion. . . .we must conclude that ABP has proven such a violation here."" Eiberger, 622 F.2d at 1081. The outcome in Eiberger may have resulted more from the case's timing than its factual circumstances. Although the lower 
court's decision was handed down over a year after Sylvania overturned Schwinn and its per se standard, the trial occurred 
while Schwinn was still the law of the land. 8 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law 480 (1989). Observing the lack of discussion of 
interbrand market benefits of the restraint, the district court appears not to have weighed all the circumstances as required by 
Sylvania. Most likely, this is due to the close proximity of the decision to Sylvania. It was upon the factual findings made under 
these circumstances that the Circuit Court based its decision."
1126,70," There do not appear to be any vertical restraint cases in which a possessor of less than 70% of the relevant market possessed 
market power. See, e.g., Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 26, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 
(1984)(30% market share insufficient to establish market power); compare, Graphic Products Distributors, Inc., v. Itek Corp., 717 
F.2d 1560 (11th Cir. 1983)(70-75% share indicative of market power when only a small number of firms divide the remainder 
shares); and Multiflex, Inc. v. Samuel Moore & Co., 709 F.2d 980 (5th Cir. 1983) (80% market share conferred market power). 
While the Court recognizes that the standard of market power in a section 1 case may be lower than the standard for monopoly 
power in a section 2 matter, Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc., 119 L. Ed. 2d 265, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 2090 
(1992), we note that the Second Circuit concluded in Broadway Delivery Corp. v. United Parcel Serv., 651 F.2d 122, 129 (2d Cir. 
1981), that ""sometimes, but not inevitably, it will be useful to suggest that a market share below 50% is rarely evidence of "
1127,," monopoly power, a share between 50% and 70% can occasionally show monopoly power, and a share above 70% is usually 
strong evidence of monopoly power."""
1127,71," Coors entered the New York State in mid-1987 and has obtained 7.1% of all sales. Coors Light held 18% of the New York 
Metropolitan Market in 1990."
1127,72," If Eiberger is read narrowly tailored to its facts, the decision holds that in an oligopolist market, a restraint which eliminates 
intrabrand competition and for which no valid procompetitive reasons are offered and from which no interbrand benefits are 
found, may violate the antitrust laws without a showing of market power or actual effects on the interbrand market. "
1128,73," The State's argument, that A-B's leading position in the beer market prohibit it from implementing improvements so to achieve 
increased profits, is not persuasive. Although A-B is the leading beer producer in New York State, a position it achieved by 
offering consumers the desired combination of price and quality, it does not possess monopoly power. In the Second Circuit's 
Starter Sportswear decision the Court found that even a business possessing monopoly power can validly impose vertical 
restraints that are intended primarily to maximize profits. Trans Sport, Inc. v. Starter Sportswear, Inc., 964 F.2d 186, 190 (2d Cir. 
1992). The State's also incorrectly asserts that Eiberger supports its argument. In Eiberger, contrary to the State's claim, the Court did 
not find that Sony's position among the leaders in the market prohibited it from imposing a restraint intended to improve its 
market share. Rather, the Court merely stated the Sony's ""market position completely undercuts any arguments for leniency"" 
based on its ""new entrant"" status. Eiberger, 622 F.2d at 1080-1081. Sony was not entitled to, nor in the present matter is A-B 
asking for, special leniency. Nevertheless, A-B will not be barred from implementing pro-competitive policies simply because it 
happens to be a successful competitor in the past."
1128,74," Notwithstanding this fact, it appears that presently all the home distributor witnesses are more profitable today than they had 
been before the Agreement. "
1130,75," In Eiberger, there were no pro-competitive interbrand competitive benefits to weigh against the intrabrand harms. Eiberger at 
1078 n.17. The Court found the restraint unreasonable by weighing significant intrabrand harm against zero interbrand 
competitive benefits. "

P.2d 612, 616 (1978). Simply put, such clauses permit utilities to pass through to their customers fuel costs as they are incurred,

improper venue and dilatory exceptions of prematurity, lack of procedural capacity and improper cumulation of actions. The 
district court denied all of these exception, except for lack of procedural capacity while is still pending. While the court of appeal 
generally affirmed the denial of these other exceptions, we confine our review to the jurisdictional issue and thus do not address 
these other exceptions. "

1147,18," Defendants' arguments are not limited to any particular claim, but rather are addressed to all of plaintiffs' claims. In this 
regard, defendants note that they filed a single exception of lack of subject matter jurisdiction, that all plaintiffs' claims are based 
on the same operative facts, and that plaintiffs' claims integrally interwoven. Nonetheless, as plaintiffs primarily rely upon their 
antitrust claim and as that was the sole claim before the court of appeal, the discussion that follows may focus more significantly 
on the antitrust claim with the understanding that much of what is said also applies to the other state law claims. (See note 14, 
supra, rejecting plaintiffs' argument that only the antitrust claim is before this court.)"
1147,19," The filed-rate doctrine, in its simplest form, provides that ""[a utility] can claim no rate as a legal right that is other than the filed 
rate."" Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. v. Northwestern Public Service Co., 341 U.S. 246, 251, 71 S. Ct. 692, 695, 95 L.Ed. 912, 919

and some theoretical reasonable rate that would or should have been approved absent the wrongful conduct.  H.J.,Inc. v. 
Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 954 F.2d 485, 488 (8th Cir.), cert. denied,    U.S.   , 112 S. Ct. 2306, 119 L. Ed. 2d 228

Hypothetical Rates in Antitrust Damages Calculations: Reforming the Keogh Doctrine, 38 Stan. L.Rev. 1141 (1986). "
1148,20," Plaintiffs correctly depict a traditional ""rate"" case as one in which the LPSC issues an order, generally an order issued on a 
utility's application for a rate increase. From such an order (or any other order of the LPSC), an interested party may judicially 
appeal by commencing a direct action against the LPSC in its domicile (the Nineteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of 
East Baton Rouge) within three months from the effective date of such order. LSA-R.S. 45:1192. In such case, judicial review is 
confined to a determination of whether the LPSC exercised its ratemaking authority arbitrarily, capriciously, or unreasonably.  
Central Louisiana Electric Co. v. Louisiana Public Service Comm'n, 508 So. 2d 1361, 1364 (La. 1987). Direct appeal from the 
Nineteenth Judicial District Court's decision in such cases is to this court. La. Const. Art. IV, § 21(E). "
1149,21," In light of our finding that the filed-rate doctrine is inapplicable under the facts of the instant case, we leave for another day the 
question plaintiffs raise of whether that doctrine is alive and well in Louisiana. We likewise note, but decline to address, two 
similar arguments raised by defendants and amici; briefly stated, these other arguments are that: (1) since regulation takes the 
place of competition as between a utility and its customers, application of the antitrust laws in this context is inappropriate on 
policy grounds, State ex rel. Guste v. Council of City of New Orleans, 309 So. 2d 290, 294 (La. 1975); and (2) since the antitrust "
1150,," laws embodied in the revised statutes and the LPSC's regulatory jurisdiction is embodied in the constitution, it is axiomatic that 
constitutional provisions prevail over statutory provisions, State v. Franklin, 202 La. 439, 12 So. 2d 211 (1943)."

1151,23," Four pragmatic justifications have been identified for using such clauses: ""(1) to reduce the number of rate proceedings and the expenses attended thereon, (2) a series of smaller increases to the

expenses, and as a result (4) a somewhat reduced cost of capital which ultimately would accrue to the benefit of the consumer."" Comment, Utility Rates, Consumers, and the New York State Public Service Commission, 39 Alb. L. Rev. 707, 754 (1975)."
1151,24," As we have noted, ""[r]regulatory lag is the loss of proper earnings claimed by a utility between the time a petition for a rate 
increase is filed and the rate relief actually becomes effective by administrative or judicial determination."" Central Louisiana 
Electric Co. v. Louisiana Public Service Comm'n, 508 So. 2d 1361, 1366 (La. 1987); see also Louisiana Power & Light Co. v. 
Louisiana Public Service Comm'n, 523 So. 2d 850, 856 n. 3 (La. 1988)."
1151,25," Unsurprisingly, judicial treatment of automatic fuel adjustment clauses has been dryly portrayed: ""[a] lawyer who attempts to 
chop his way around in the jungle of legal opinion on the subject of these clauses is apt to find himself wandering in circles with 
his intellectual machete so dulled he is soon brought to a standstill."" Ardery, supra at 39. "
1152,26," ""Commission-made"" rates are ""those rates which are implemented subsequent to an exhaustive evidentiary presentation of 
the utility's expenses and their reasonableness."" Equitable Gas Co. v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Comm'n, 106 Pa. Cmwlth. 240, 
526 A.2d 823, 830, appeal denied, 516 Pa. 644, 533 A.2d 714 (1987)(emphasis in original).  The distinction between rates 
implemented pursuant to automatic fuel adjustment clauses and ""commission-made"" rates is that while the latter are the result of 
a full-fledged rate proceeding in which the reasonableness of all the utility's costs are reviewed, the former are implemented 
automatically with no antecedent reasonableness review. Id."
1152,27," We recently defined retroactive rate making as occur[ring] when a utility is permitted to recover an additional charge for past 
losses, or when a utility is required to refund revenues collected pursuant to its lawfully established rates."" South Central Bell 
Telephone Co. v. Louisiana Public Service Comm'n, 594 So. 2d 357,359 (La. 1992)(collecting cases). We further noted that the 
underlying rationale for this rule is that ""[a] commission-made rate furnishes the applicable law for the utility and its customers 
until a change is made by the Commission."" Id. (emphasis supplied). As established above, the rates at issue here, however, are 
not ""commission-made"" rates and thus are not protected from subsequent review by the rule against retroactive rate making.

1153,28," ""An adjustment clause is automatic in the sense that the clause itself and the method for its calculation is found in the tariff 
sheet."" Fowler, supra at 568. A tariff is ""a published volume of rate schedules and general terms and conditions under which a 
product or service will he supplied."" MGTC, Inc. v. Public Service Comm'n of Wyoming, 735 P.2d 103, 104 n. 1 (Wyo. 
1987)(citing 3 American Gas Association, Regulation of the Gas Industry, GL-158 (1981))."
1153,29," See also City of Chicago v. Illinois Commerce Comm'n, 13 Ill.2d 607, 150 N.E.2d 776, 781 (1958)(by authorizing automatic 
adjustment clause commission does not give up its right to initiate proceedings to determine the reasonableness of the utility's 
rates); Delmarva, 400 A.2d at 1152-53 (explaining that retention of jurisdiction is necessary to assure that charges passed on 
are reasonable because such clauses ""contemplate complex formulas which must be tested against mathematical calculations 
from designated figures each month"" and distinguishing necessarily ongoing process of verifying fuel adjustment clauses form 
the ordinary rate making process); Gulf Power Co., supra (describing such clauses as ""ongoing processes""). "
1154,30," As noted elsewhere, the LPSC has instigated an investigation into LIG's WACOG and Trans-La's PGA filings. "
1155,31," Another articulation of this distinction is as follows: Primary jurisdiction, unlike the rule of exhaustion of administrative remedies which applies when a claim is cognizable in the first 
instance only in an administrative agency, applies when a claim is originally cognizable in a court.  In exhaustion cases judicial 
proceedings are premature until the administrative process has been completed, while in primary jurisdiction cases the judicial 
process is suspended pending referral to the administrative agency of issues which under a regulatory scheme are within the 
agency's special competence.  United States v. Western Pacific Railroad Co., 352 U.S. 59, 77 S. Ct. 161, 1 L. Ed. 2d 126 
(1956). CLECO, 601 So. 2d at 1388 (Lemmon, J. concurring).  We note that these terms have been described as confusing and are 
often used interchangeably.  Penny, 906 F.2d at 187 n. 3; 1 Areeda & Turner, Antitrust Law P 223h at 144 (1978); 6 Von 
Kalinowski, Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulation § 44A.01[1] at p. 44A-3 (1992)(describing these doctrines as ""tools of less than 
surgical precision"")."
1155,32," Moore, supra, indicates that, HN15[
] as a matter of constitutional law, original jurisdiction over the regulation of public 
utilities in general and rates in particular has been carved out of the district court's jurisdiction and consigned to the LPSC: ""the 
constitution itself provides expressly for original jurisdiction over certain claims to be exercised by the Public Service 
Commission."" 567 So. 2d at 79-80 n. 7. This subtraction from the court's jurisdiction of certain matters results in exclusive 
jurisdiction of such subtracted matters being vested in the agency and is to be contrasted with the typical situation in which ""the 
creation of a new agency means the addition to the legal system of a new lawmaking and law applying authority, with no explicit 
subtraction from the previously-existing power of courts."" 4 Davis, Administrative Law § 22.1,p. 81 (2d Ed. 1983). In the latter 
context, the agency and courts each have concurrent jurisdiction. Id.; see also Magnolia Coal, 576 So. 2d at 487 (Dennis, J. 
concurring). "
1156,33," The underlying, albeit unexpressed, rationale behind the above line of cases is that ""HN16[
] where the essence of the claim 
is that a utility has charged too much for the service provided, the claim is for reparations[, i.e., refund of overcharges; 
conversely, w]here the essence of the claim is not that too much has been charged for service, but rather that the utility has 
done something else which has wronged the plaintiff, the claim is for ordinary damages."" City of Chicago, ex rel. Thrasher v. 
Commonwealth Edison Co., 159 Ill.App.3d 1076, 112 Ill.Dec. 46, 513 N.E.2d 460, 463 (1987)(citing Klopp v. Commonwealth

Co., 61 Ohio St.3d 147, 573 N.E.2d 655, 660 (1991)(noting that ""although the allegations of the complaint seem to sound in tort 
and contract law, it must not be forgotten that the contract involved is the utility rate schedule."") "
1157,34," In this regard, we note that in the related case, CNO II, the Fourth Circuit, in addressing the NOPSI ratepayers' right of action, 
stated: The first petition for damages was filed on behalf of the ratepayers and NOPSI together. NOPSI does not complain of sharing its 
recovery with the ratepayers, and United does not show any post-trial burden resulting from the arguably improper maintenance 
of the ratepayers' right of action."

1966)(holding that LPSC lacks authority to render a money judgment for ordinary damages, as that is a judicial function)."
1158,36," To illustrate, we offer the following example considered in argument before this court: suppose that the fixed rate the utility 
was authorized to charge was $ 1.00, but the utility allegedly charged $ 2.00; this dispute, as conceded by counsel for the LPSC, 
would be cognizable in court. Such is not the case here, however, as plaintiffs are not challenging a fixed rate, but rather are 
challenging the variable WACOG and PGA components of LIG's and Trans-La's rates. See also 73B C.J.S.,Public Utilities § 100 
(1983)(citing Morrison Cafeteria,supra, and noting that ""generally, a suit to recover back excessive charges paid to a public utility 
may be maintained without first proceeding before the commission, but such a suit is not maintainable where it would 
necessitate the fixing of a rate by the court."")"

1159,38," In so holding, we obviate the need to rule on whether plaintiffs' claims against the unregulated defendants fail to state a cause 
of action, as alleged by one of the defendants in its brief to this court. We note that ""if the claims are empty allegations [as

the Defendants engaged in exclusionary or restrictive conduct in furtherance of its specific intent; third, that there was a 
dangerous probability that Defendants could sooner or later achieve [their] goal of monopoly power in the relevant market; 
fourth, that the Defendants' conduct occurred in or affected interstate commerce; and, fifth, that the Plaintiff was injured in the

Id. The appeals court overturned the district judge's factual finding of nonfunctionality under the clearly erroneous standard."
1193,9, The Plaintiffs admit that their complaint does not explicitly allege the dilution of a trademark.
1193,10," The Plaintiffs' complaint cites Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 14330. Section 14330 (b), upon which the Plaintiffs' claim is based, 
was reenacted as section 14335 (a). "
1194,11," In 1985 Morton and Tigrett, the original founders of the Hard Rock Cafe, entered into a written agreement pursuant to which 
Morton was to have the exclusive right to operate businesses of every kind, including but not limited to Entertainment/Music 
Themed Restaurants, using the trademark and trade name ""Hard Rock,"" in the Western United States, and Tigrett was to have 
the same rights in the Eastern half. Under the agreement, Morton and Tigrett established the Hard Rock Cafe Licensing Corporation, which was to be controlled by 
them equally, and was to act as their agent in holding legal title to the Hard Rock trademark and trade name for their joint benefit 
and in administering, enforcing and protecting their rights in and in connection with the mark, with the revenue to be shared 
equally by Morton and Tigrett. The Licensing Corporation was to be governed by a Board of Directors consisting of three 
members, one appointed by Morton, on appointed by Tigrett and one appointed by the court in the event the two of them could 
not agree on the name of the third director."
1194,12," Because Licensing Corporation is a New York Corporation, New York law governs the determination of matters relating to the 
corporation, including fiduciary duties. See Davis & Cox v. Summa Corp., 751 F.2d 1507, 1527 (9th Cir. 1985) (""Claims involving 
'internal affairs' of corporations, such as the breach of fiduciary duties, are subject to the laws of the state of incorporation.""). "
1196,13," The Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to establish a fiduciary relationship between Rank and Morton. This is true, even 
though the Complaint erroneously pleads these facts under the joint venture label. "
1198,14," In their Reply, the Defendants undercut their argument by contending that the Morton and Rank interests are completely 
separate as a result of the Settlement Agreement that was executed by Morton and Tigrett, the original owners of the Hark Rock 
Cafe trademark. Indeed, their Reply states that ""Morton's argument that the operational secrets were 'jointly owned' is 
contradicted by the agreement itself."" Defendants' Reply at 22. In arguing against the joint ownership concept, however, the 
Defendants strengthen the Plaintiffs' assertion that the Defendants misappropriated the trade secrets ""of another."" "
1204,1," HN4[
] RICO violations are found in 18 U.S.C. § 1962. Specifically, section 1962(a) makes it ""unlawful for any person who has received any income derived . . . from a pattern of racketeering activity . . . to use or invest . . . such income . . . in 
acquisition of . . . any enterprise which is engaged in . . . interstate . . . commerce."" Section 1962(b) makes it ""unlawful for any 
person through a pattern of racketeering activity . . . to acquire . . . any interest in . . . any enterprise which is engaged in . . . 
interstate . . . commerce."" Section 1962(c) makes it ""unlawful for any person . . . associated with any enterprise engaged in . . . 
interstate . . . commerce [] to . . . participate . . . in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering 
activity. . . ."" Section 1962(d) makes it ""unlawful for any person to conspire to violate . . . (a), (b), or (c) of this section."" 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1962. Section 1961(1) of RICO defines racketeering activity, in part, as ""any act or threat involving murder, kidnaping, gambling, arson, 
robbery, bribery, extortion, or dealing in narcotic or other dangerous drugs, which is chargeable under State law and punishable 
by imprisonment for more than one year,"" or ""any act which is indictable under [a variety of] provisions of title 18, United States 
Code."" 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). "
1205,2," The plaintiff in Sedima also alleged a violation of § 1962(d), but the Court limited its standing analysis to the § 1962(c) claim. 
See Schiffels v. Kemper, 978 F.2d 344, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 27829, at * 12-13 (7th Cir. 1992) (""The reason [that the Court's 
standing discussion did not directly address § 1962(d)] seems apparent: there was no need to address standing to raise a § 
1962(d) claim, because if a plaintiff has standing to bring a § 1962(c) claim he necessarily has standing to raise a § 1962(d) 
claim.""). "
1206,3," The reasons for including a directness element, according to the Court, are at least threefold. First, the less direct the 
relationship, the more difficult it is to determine how much of the damage is due to the alleged RICO conduct and how much to 
extraneous conduct. Second, courts may have significant difficulty apportioning damages among plaintiffs who are removed, in 
varying degrees, from the alleged injurious conduct. Third, the more directly an individual is injured, the more likely that 
individual will take on the role of private attorney general, and thus help uphold the law.  Holmes, 112 S. Ct. at 1311. "
1213,1, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed defendant Lasser. 
1214,2," The Supreme Court has held that HN5[
] proof of multiple schemes, by itself, is insufficient to show a pattern of racketeering 
activity. H.J., 429 U.S. at 240-41. However, evidence of multiple schemes is relevant to the determination of whether a pattern 
has been alleged.  Midwest Grinding, 976 F.2d at 1025. "
1215,3," Although it is unclear why, plaintiff's amended complaint also names Myotec as a defendant. "
1216,4," Nowhere in the amended complaint is it clear that Myotec received a fee in consideration for Zonar's right to require 
termination and be reappointed."
1216,5," Plaintiff's amended complaint alleged both violation and conspiracy to violate RICO. Since plaintiff has failed to allege a 
violation of RICO and does not allege an agreement by defendants to do anything more than the alleged violations, plaintiff's 
RICO conspiracy allegation is also insufficient and will be dismissed as part of the RICO count. See Midwest Grinding, 976 F.2d 
at 1026. "
1217,6," The kickbacks received by Fischer were tied to ""consulting"" payments from Myotec to Zonar. Even though the characterization 
of those payments as consulting fees belies their purpose, plaintiff does not contend that the payments were in any way tied to 
the actual purchases and sales of Miyano Machinery's goods by Myotec. "
1218,7," Several courts have expressly stated that the anticompetitive effect need not be in the form of price discrimination even though 
that is the primary thrust of § 2. See Environmental Tectonics, 847 F.2d 1052; Larry R. George Sales, 587 F.2d 266; Rangen, 
Inc., 351 F.2d 851. But see Grace, 538 F.2d 170 (indirect price discrimination found in higher prices charged because of bribe to 
buyer's agent). "
1226,1," Constructive trust is actually a remedy, and as such cannot be breached. Therefore, the Amended Complaint will be construed 
to seek the imposition of a constructive trust. Plaintiff acquiesces in this interpretation. (Pl. Mem. at 1)"
1226,2," Plaintiff has dismissed voluntarily its claim for breach of a resulting charitable trust, denominated Count IV. Plaintiff also has 
dismissed Count VI, seeking declaratory and copyright invalidation, against defendant PBD only. Thus, the only claims 
remaining against PBD are the antitrust claims."
1226,3," ""Manuals"" refers both to the teacher manuals and to the student workbooks."
1226,4," Before defendant NCHE secured trademark and copyright protection in 1986, the Growing Healthy program existed as two 
separate programs under different names. (Amd Complt P 33) At the risk of confusing further a factual situation less than clear 
on the face of the Amended Complaint, I will refer to the program throughout this opinion as the Growing Healthy program. As 
discussed infra with regard to plaintiff's copyright claim, however, the Amended Complaint describes NCHE's program as the 
latest incarnation, and a consolidation of, the previous programs. "
1249,1," I note at the outset that because AMC is in the market for the tying product, hospital services, I take its argument to be that as 
a matter of law an entity cannot engage in illegal tying unless it participates in the markets for both the tying and tied products. "
1250,2," If Action were unable to prove all the elements of the per se test, it might still state a claim under the rule of reason. Reduced 
to essentials, the difference between the two lines of inquiry is that under the rule of reason, but not under per se analysis, the 
plaintiff ""has the burden of proving that the [challenged practice] violated the Sherman Act because it unreasonably restrained 
competition."" Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 29. In other words, once a plaintiff has established the three elements of the per se 
test, anti-competitive effect on the market for the tied product is presumed and its actual scope need not be shown.  However, 
the per se plaintiff must still ""make some minimal showing of real or potential foreclosed commerce caused by the tie, if only as a 
matter of practical inferential common sense."" Wells Real Estate, 850 F.2d at 815 n.11. See also Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 
15 (""Per se condemnation--condemnation without inquiry into actual market conditions--is only appropriate if the existence of 
forcing is probable."") (footnote omitted)."
1250,3," It is counterintuitive to suppose that a company could evade the strictures of anti-tying doctrine merely by erecting corporate 
walls between the tying and the tied products. It would gut that doctrine to allow businesses to avoid charges of illegal tying 
either by spinning off subsidiaries to produce one of the tied products or by entering into kickback schemes with unrelated 
entities. The very language of the Sherman Act prohibits contracts, combinations, and conspiracies in restraint of trade, each of 
which seems to contemplate the involvement of two or more entities."
1250,4," This is strong although indirect evidence that there is no requirement that a defendant must participate in the market for the 
tying as well as the tied product in order for an illegal tie to exist. If there were such a requirement, it would have been simpler 
and more logical for the Court to have disposed of Jefferson Parish by noting that Roux did not participate in the market for the 
tying service (acute care) than by conducting an inquiry into East Jefferson's market share and the alleged market imperfections 
which supposedly allowed the hospital to charge noncompetitive prices. "
1251,5," Section 21B provides that whoever solicits or receives any remuneration . . . in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or 
recommending purchasing, leasing, or ordering any good, facility, service, or item for which payment may be made in whole 
or in part under this chapter, or whoever offers or pays any remuneration . . . to induce such person to [do the same] shall 
be punished by a fine . . . or by imprisonment . . . or by both . . . . Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 118E, § 21B (West 1992). Section 1320a-7b provides in part that whoever knowingly and willfully solicits or receives any remuneration . . . (A) in return for referring an individual to a person

or in part under subchapter XVIII of this chapter or a State health care program, shall be guilty of a felony and . . . shall be 
fined . . . or imprisoned . . . or both."
1251,42," U.S.C.A. § 1320a-7b(b)(1) (West 1991). Section 1320a-7b(b)(2) is a parallel provision making it unlawful to offer 
remuneration to induce others to make referrals."
1251,6," Action's memorandum does not address the question of whether violations of the anti-fraud statutes may properly serve as a 
basis for Sherman Act claims. I take it, therefore, that Action concedes that they cannot. Nevertheless, I summarize the case 
which appears to have so held for the sake of any light it may throw on the inquiry under the Massachusetts Consumer 
Protection Act."
1251,7," The Court of Appeals noted, however, that ""to the extent West Allis has demonstrated a viable claim under the Sherman Act 
[citation omitted] independent of its claim under the Medicare fraud provisions [citation omitted] . . . , the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § "
1252,26," , expressly provides the court with the statutory authority to enjoin the criminal activity complained of."" Id. at 257 (footnote 
omitted) (emphasis added)."
1252,8," Section 2(b) of the Consumer Protection Act states that it is the intent of the legislature that in construing paragraph (a) of this section . . . the courts will be guided by the 
interpretations given by the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Courts to section 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade 
Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1)), as from time to time amended. Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 93A, § 2(b) (West 1984). Section 5(a)(1) of the FTC Act provides that ""unfair methods of competition 
in commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce, are declared unlawful."" 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(1). Therefore, in 
formulating its definition, the Purity Supreme court relied upon the FTC definition of unfair practices: 1) within the ""penumbra of 
some common-law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness;"" 2) ""immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous;"" "
1253,," or 3) causing ""substantial injury to consumers (or competitors or other businessmen)."" 380 Mass. at 777 (internal quotation 
marks omitted) (quoting 29 FR 8355 (1964)). It seems clear that the first prong of the FTC definition intends to include criminal statutes among those statutes from which 
concepts of unfairness may be drawn. See, e.g., FTC v. Sperry & Hutchinson Co., 405 U.S. 233, 243, 31 L. Ed. 2d 170, 92 S. 
Ct. 898 (1972); Commonwealth v. DeCotis, 366 Mass. 234, 241, 316 N.E.2d 748 (1974) (""Unfairness under the [FTC] act has 
not been limited to practices forbidden at common law or by criminal statute."") (citations omitted) (cited in Chroniak and Pugliese 
v. Golden Investment Corp., No. 91-2343, slip op. at 15 (1st Cir. Jan. 19, 1993)). However, even if a violation of a criminal statute may properly be alleged as a basis for a violation of section 5(a)(1) of the FTC 
Act, a subject upon which this court expresses no opinion, that fact would not advance Action's argument. Section 5(a)(1) is 
enforced by the FTC. It provides no private right of action. See, e.g., Baum v. Great Western Cities, Inc. of New Mexico, 703 
F.2d 1197, 1209 (10th Cir. 1983). Therefore, no parallel may be drawn between section 5(a)(1) and the Massachusetts 
Consumer Protection Act on the question before me."
1253,9," Action's brief does not address the implications of the fact that one of the anti-fraud statutes, 42 U.S.C. section 1320a-7b, is a 
federal rather than state statute."
1253,10," The regulation states on its face that it is aimed at laws ""intended to provide the consumers of this Commonwealth 
protection."" Moreover, it seems to have been applied mostly, if not exclusively, in that context. See, e.g., Calimlim v. Foreign Car 
Center, Inc., 392 Mass. 228, 235, 467 N.E.2d 443 (1984) (suit by customers against dealership premised on violations of 
statutes requiring warranties of merchantability and fitness); Piccuirro v. Gaitenby, 20 Mass. App. Ct. 286, 480 N.E.2d 30 (1985)

statute). "

1258,1," Two weeks before filing the federal complaint, the borrowers moved to amend their state complaint to charge that the banks 
had breached their duty of good faith by ""unreasonable, illegal, and anticompetitive"" restrictions on alternative financing. Shortly 
after the federal complaint was filed, the banks opposed the state amendment. When the borrowers responded that the federal 
claims were not being asserted in the state case, the state court allowed the amendment, striking the words ""illegal"" and 
""anticompetitive."" "
1259,2," Several state courts have reached the same conclusion. See United Central Bank, N.A. v. Kruse, 439 N.W.2d 849 (Iowa 1989); 
Waite v. Banctexas-Houston, N.A., 792 S.W.2d 538 (Tex. Ct. App. 1990)."
1259,3," We give little weight to occasional references by Congress, in the legislative history of section 1972, to suits in ""federal"" courts. 
See, e.g., 2 One-Bank Holding Company Legislation of 1970: Hearings Before the Senate Comm. on Banking and Currency, 
91st. Cong., 2d Sess. 966 (1970) (statement of Sen. Bennett) (referring to ""the process of suit through the Federal courts . . .""). 
These references, if any intent is attributable to them, appear to reflect the natural assumption that Bank Holding Company Act 
claims would usually be litigated in federal forums. "
1260,4," In Calderon Rosado this court rejected on waiver grounds a res judicata defense in a federal action. The defendant had earlier 
agreed to the plaintiff's voluntary dismissal ""with prejudice"" of a wrongful discharge claim under Puerto Rican law brought in a 
local court, ""seemingly acceding to plaintiff's desire to litigate in federal court"" under a federal statute.  805 F.2d at 1086. "
1261,5," The borrowers were only slightly more diligent in seeking to add the state claims to the federal case. In late January 1991, they 
moved to amend the federal complaint to assert the state claims and to stay the state action. This occurred, however, after the 
close of state discovery and on the eve of the banks' deadline for filing summary judgment motions. "
1272,1," When referring to Iljin Corp., Iljin Diamond, and Huh collectively, the Court will use the term ""the Iljin defendants""."
1272,2," Because GE and Norton have each settled with different defendants, the Court, for the sake of clarity, allowed GE and Norton 
to file separate ""Fifth Amended Complaints""."
1272,3, The Iljin defendants have expressly invited the Court to treat their Motion as a motion for summary judgment. 
1273,4," In the Iljin defendants' amended counterclaims, filed on January 29, 1993, the Iljin defendants add a count for intentional 
interference with contractual relations against GE based upon GE's alleged bad faith assertion of claims against Elwood 
Hydraulics Company, Inc., a former defendant in this action. GE's Motion does not technically address this counterclaim, the 
underlying premise of which is, however, analogous to those counterclaims addressed by the Court in the context of GE's 
Motion. "
1275,5," The mail and wire fraud claims involve the Iljin defendants' allegedly fraudulent efforts to recruit present and former GE 
employees and to obtain parts to utilize the trade secrets. "
1277,6," Section 43(a) was amended accordingly in 1988. GE contends that this amended version of section 43(a) is applicable to the 
present action, despite the fact that the amendment did not take effect until November 16, 1989, two months after GE filed this 
suit. Although GE does not address this issue, the Court presumes that GE bases its contention on allegations that violations of 
section 43(a) by the Iljin defendants continued after suit was filed. Having reached the conclusion that its analysis would be the 
same under both pre-amendment section 43(a) and post-amendment section 43(a), the Court finds it unnecessary to decide the 
correctness of GE's contention."
1277,7, KAIST is the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.
1277,8," The Court is cognizant of the fact that the Poli Court was addressing section 43(a) as it read prior to the 1988 amendment. The 
amendment, as far as the Court can discern, does not, for our purposes, substantively alter the reach of section 43(a). The 
amendment divided section 43(a) into two subsections. The first subsection relates to infringement claims, and the second 
subsection relates to false advertising claims. In its brief, GE asserts that it is bringing its claim under the infringement 
subsection. See GE Brief at 27-28. There is nothing in the language of the amendment or the legislative history surrounding it to 
indicate that, in claims brought under the infringement subsection, this Court should diverge from the First Circuit's requirement 
that plaintiff show an attempt by defendant to trade on plaintiff's goodwill. See S. Rep. No. 515, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 40-41 
(1988); 2 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition, §§ 25.1 and 27.2 (2d ed. 1984 & Supp. 1991). "
1282,1," In exceptional circumstances which can be disregarded for purposes of this proceeding, photographs from other sources are 
accepted by the school districts. One of the interests of the school districts advanced by the exclusivity of the source of yearbook 
photographs is uniformity of appearance. "
1283,2," Counsel at argument stated that these ""activity photos"" have been provided without charge to the school districts in the past as 
part of the exchange for exclusivity, but that changes in costs made it likely that some additional charge for activity photos would 
be part of future contracts. The analysis is not changed whichever pricing scheme is in effect."
1283,3," Counsel for Windber Area stated that, in the current contract between Windber and Cover Studies, there was no permission to 
charge a sitting fee and that if sitting fees were mistakenly obtained from their students they were required to be refunded. 
Counsel for Forest Hills was not able to state whether a sitting fee was charged. The topic was explored for the Court's 
understanding of the allegations in the complaint, and the analysis is the same whether or not a sitting fee is charged."
1283,4," At argument, counsel for Windber Area asserted that formerly the school district had advertised for bids, but discontinued that 
practice because Cover Studios for many years was the only photographer that submitted a bid, and the advertising was 
therefore a wasteful expenditure. No state law requires the contracts in question to be submitted for bidding. Counsel for plaintiff 
asserted that that may change if the costs of photography increase in the future above the minimum required by state law for 
competitive bidding. The antitrust analysis is unaffected by the existence or absence of state law bidding requirements."
1283,5," The school districts raised their immunity from monetary damages pursuant to the Local Governments Antitrust Immunity Act. 
15 U.S.C. § 34, § 35. Plaintiff seeks only monetary relief in his complaint, but suggests that the school districts remain as 
defendants for purposes of declaratory relief."
1283,6," I asked plaintiff's counsel what alteration to current practice plaintiff believed would not violate the antitrust laws, and proposed 
hypothetically (1) banning sitting fees; (2) banning the offer of activity photos as a package with yearbook photographs; or (3) 
ordering mandatory disclaimers that students were free to obtain graduation photos elsewhere. Although injunctive relief was not 
requested in the complaint, plaintiff's counsel suggested that the only thing that would cure the alleged violation would be a ban 
on any requirement that yearbook photos be uniformly supplied, effected by a type of ""yearbook fair"" in which all interested 
photographers would have access to the students. Activity photos would either fall by the wayside or have to be purchased by a 
school district separately. "
1284,7," In paragraphs 15 and 19 of his complaint, plaintiff states that the defendants' actions ""may also constitute violations of the 
Clayton Act, section 3 (Robinson Patman Amendment)"", if Cover Studios discounted its prices to the school districts. Section 3 
of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 14, and the Robinson-Patman Antidiscrimination Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13, 13a, 13b, and 21a, are two 
distinct statutes. Whichever plaintiff means, he does not affirmatively plead price discrimination between different purchasers, 
see 15 U.S.C. § 13(a), or a sale of ""goods,"" see Chelson v. Oregonian Publishing Co., 715 F.2d 1368, 1372 (9th Cir.1983), and 
therefore does not state a claim for violation of either statute. Although it is therefore unnecessary to consider the effect of the 
Nonprofit Institutions Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13c, on the type of contracts at issue, at least one court has taken the position that both 
Cover Studios and the school districts would be exempt from the Robinson Patman Act. See Burge v. Bryant Public School 
District of Saline County, 520 F. Supp. 328, 331-32 (E.D. Ark 1980), aff'd on other grounds, 658 F.2d 611 (8th Cir.1981)."
1284,8," Plaintiff does not allege facts supporting a claim of a conspiracy to monopolize, but only conduct by a single firm, Cover 
Studios, in entering into two bilateral agreements with Forest Hills and Windber Area. See Stephen Jay Photography, 903 F.2d 
at 996. "
1285,9," Given the notoriously low barriers to entry in the commercial photography business and the participation, which I judicially 
notice, of several national department store chains in the portrait photography business, even if Cover Studios' market share 
approached 100% it is doubtful that it could achieve legal monopoly power. Plaintiff cannot be allowed to allege that success in 
business is equivalent to monopoly behavior, whatever may be the lay perception of that term. "
1286,10," And a fortiori, plaintiff fails to allege Cover Studios' monopoly power under Section 2. See Eastman Kodak Co., 119 L. Ed. 2d 
at 293 . "
1287,11," Plaintiff's allegation that students were required to accept the services of Cover Studios was simply a restatement of his 
coercion theory, and HN10[
] the allegation that Cover Studios' prices were arbitrarily set is wholly insufficient to state an 
antitrust claim. See ARCO v. USA Petroleum, 495 U.S. 328, 335-39, 109 L. Ed. 2d 333, 110 S. Ct. 1884 (1990). "

1302,3," Roth, in its response brief at 10 n.10, contends that this Court erred in its January 6, 1993 because it labelled the Act as 
""admittedly protectionist"" after having adopted the Zenith Radio interpretation of legislative intent. This court agrees that the Act 
is fundamentally to be interpreted in accord with antitrust doctrine. That does not mean, however, that the Court should never 
look to other anti-dumping statutes, e.g., Tariff Acts of 1913, 1930 for guidance in interpreting particular aspects of the 1916 Act, 
such as what constitutes an import. See 1992 Order at 13; Zenith Radio, at 494 F. Supp. at 1216. Nor does it mean that the 
1916 Act does not have some protectionist effects in spite of the intentions of its drafters. See 1992 Order at 11 n.1, 13, 14 n.2 
and supporting authority. In short, ""antitrust"" is not an antonym for ""protectionist."" "

1317,8," Although repetitive, the following constitute the Caxton defendants' attacks with regard to plaintiffs' § 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 
claims: With respect to ""materiality,"" the defendants contend that any factual omissions on their part could not have been 
""material"" since plaintiffs did not reduce their short position in the April and May two-year notes after becoming aware of the 
alleged manipulation in late May. As for ""reliance,"" the defendants acknowledge that in a § 10(b) claim based upon the ""fraud on 
the market"" theory, which is the theory alleged in this case, there is a rebuttable presumption of reliance on the integrity of the 
market; see Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 247-58, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194, 108 S. Ct. 978 (1988), however, they argue that the 
complaint itself rebuts the presumption of reliance because its allegations show that plaintiffs were speculators who increased 
their short position even after learning in late May that the integrity of the relevant markets was compromised by manipulation. As for proving ""transaction causation,"" the defendants argue that the plaintiffs' post-May 24 activity contradicts plaintiffs' 
allegations that they took their ""short"" position because they were uninformed and that had they been informed, they would not 
have suffered a loss. Finally, with respect to ""loss causation,"" defendants contend that since plaintiffs increased their short 
position after concluding the market was being manipulated, their loss was not proximately caused by the alleged manipulation 
but rather was the outcome of plaintiffs' own speculative trading."
1317,9," Appendix A appears to be a document recording purchases and sales of various futures and government securities made by 
the plaintiffs."
1317,10," The Caxton defendants request that pursuant to Rule 201(b)(2), F.R.Evid., the court take judicial notice of a chronology of 
phone calls submitted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in a hearing before the U.S. House of Representatives 
Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. Under Rule 201(b)(2), the 
court may take judicial notice of facts which are ""capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose 
accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned."" The defendants want to introduce the chronology because it lists a phone call "
1318,," between plaintiffs and the bank made on May 23, 1991 which contains the notation that the call was ""to discuss the 2-yr note 
market situation."" Defendants request is denied because the chronology is not evidence whose accuracy cannot reasonably be 
questioned. Moreover, even if the court took judicial notice of the chronology, it does not prove that plaintiffs had full knowledge 
of the manipulation as opposed to initial queries or concerns about the market."
1318,11," The plaintiffs contend that the Treasury scandal alleged in their complaint has been widely covered by the media for well over 
a year and that numerous other actions have been filed based on the same events, so that defendants cannot possibly allege 
that they are ""in the dark"" as to what their suit is about. Plaintiffs cannot be permitted to free ride off the press or the complaints 
of other parties filing similar lawsuits, rather they must prove to the court that their complaint is backed by specific facts 
supporting a ""strong inference"" of fraud. "
1319,12," Paragraph 64 of the complaint is not an admission of fraud, rather it merely states Luttrell ""informed"" plaintiff Three Crown that 
Caxton was a ""large holder"" of April two-year notes. Although plaintiffs' brief alleges that an admission to trading ""on special"" is 
tantamount to a confession of manipulation, there is no support for this inference in Paragraph 72 of the complaint."
1319,13," After this motion was fully briefed, plaintiffs submitted a letter (""the November 13, 1992 letter""), stating that they have now 
obtained access to certain Salomon Brothers documents and are in a position to bolster their complaint with more factual detail. 
Plaintiffs assert that they will be able to amend their complaint to include allegations substantially similar to a class action 
complaint recently filed before Judge Patterson of the Southern District of New York in In Re Salomon Brothers Treasury 
Litigation, 91 Civ. 5471 (RPP). Plaintiffs request that if the court determines that their complaint does not satisfy Rule 9(b), 
F.R.Civ.P., the court should, in the interest of ""judicial economy,"" review the In Re Salomon Brothers complaint rather than 
requiring plaintiffs to amend their complaint. A comparison of plaintiffs' complaint with the In Re Salomon Brothers complaint serves only to highlight the inadequacy of 
plaintiffs' complaint. There is little, if any, information and belief pleading in the other complaint, and many specific details are 
provided with respect to the role of the Steinhardt and Soros defendants in the alleged manipulation of the April and May 1991 "
1320,," two-year Treasury notes. On the other hand, the Caxton defendants are not named as defendants in that complaint, and the 
complaint contains only one paragraph making an allegation with respect to Caxton. However, the court is unable to consider the complaint before Judge Patterson for purposes of determining whether the plaintiffs 
in this case have pled fraud with particularity. Since Rule 9(b), F.R.Civ.P., is a rule of pleading, only plaintiffs' complaint may be 
examined to determine whether the rule has been satisfied; allegations made in briefs, affidavits, supplemental letters, or 
complaints submitted by other plaintiffs do not satisfy the Rule 9(b) pleading requirement. See, Andreo v. Friedlander, Gaines, 
Cohen, Rosenthal & Rosenberg, 651 F. Supp. 877 (D.Conn. 1986); see also, Goldberg v. Meridor, 81 F.R.D. 105, 111 (S.D.N.Y. 
1979) (Lasker, J.) (affidavits cannot cure lack of specificity in fraud complaint)."
1320,14," The relevant portion of § 22(a)(1), 7 U.S.C. § 25(a)(1), states as follows: HN11[
] Any person . . . who violates this chapter . . . shall be liable for actual damages resulting from one or more of the 
transactions referred to in clauses (A) through (D) . . . and caused by such violation to any other person-- (B) who made through such person any contract of sale of any commodity for future delivery (or option on such contract or 
any commodity) . . . (D) who purchased or sold a contract referred to in clause (B) hereof if the violation constitutes a manipulation of the price 
of any such contract or the price of the commodity underlying such contract."
1320,15," The Steinhardt defendants argue that these allegations are so vague and conclusory that the complaint fails to satisfy the 
liberal standard of Rule 8(a), F.R.Civ.P. The Steinhardt defendants are correct that if these are plaintiffs' only allegations with 
respect to their CEA claim, then the allegations are ""so badly conclusory that they fail to give notice of the basic events and 
circumstances of which the plaintiffs complain[],"" and that the allegations are ""meaningless as a practical matter and, as a matter 
of law, insufficient to state a claim."" Duncan v. AT&T Communications, Inc., 668 F. Supp. 232, 234 (S.D.N.Y. 1987) (Carter, J.). 
However, based on plaintiffs' brief and the structure of the complaint, most likely the plaintiffs intend for their allegations about 
the manipulation of the when-issued, secondary and financing markets for April and May two-year Treasury notes to serve as an 
elaboration of their CEA claim. "
1321,16," If plaintiffs are instead alleging that defendants manipulated ""futures contracts"" purchased by plaintiffs, their complaint must 
be dismissed for failure to meet even the liberal pleading standards of Rule 8(a), F.R.Civ.P.. Paragraph 100 contains the only 
reference to trading in futures contracts done by defendants. Paragraph 100 states ""upon information and belief"" defendants 
traded in ""Treasury Bill futures and other financial futures traded by plaintiffs."" Aside from being much too vague as to what 
futures defendants traded, this paragraph does not even allege that defendants ""manipulated"" any of those futures."
1321,17," Although the complaint at P 101-102 refers to Appendix A as the source for details as to the commodities and futures in which 
plaintiffs traded, the appendix is not much help to defendants or the court in comprehending the charges leveled against the 
defendants. As to each entry there is no clear indication as to what financial instrument is involved other than a maturity date, a 
""TCLP International Arbitrage Number"" and a coupon number; no key is provided to decipher the meaning of these numbers."
1321,18," The Steinhardt and Caxton defendants also argue that pursuant to § 2(a)(1)(A) of the CEA, the so-called Treasury 
Amendment, the CEA is inapplicable to manipulations in the when-issued, secondary and financing markets of April and May 
two-year Treasury notes. The Treasury Amendment provides: HN13[
] Nothing in this chapter . . . shall be deemed to govern 
or in any way be applicable to transactions . . . in government securities, . . . unless such transactions involve the sale thereof for 
future delivery conducted on a board of trade. 7 U.S.C. § 2. Although an exemption to a remedial statute normally must be pled 
as an affirmative defense, when the facts alleged in a complaint give rise to an affirmative defense, it may be raised in a pre-
answer motion to dismiss. See, e.g., Green v. Maraio, 722 F.2d 1013, 1019 (2d Cir, 1983). Plaintiffs complaint does admit that 
Treasury notes are ""government securities."" Complaint P 19. However, although defendants provide support in their briefs that 
transactions in the when-issued, secondary and financing markets for Treasury notes are not transactions involving ""the sale 
thereof for future delivery conducted on a board of trade,"" factual allegations in briefs and memoranda may not be considered in 
a Rule 12(b)(6), F.R.Civ.P., motion. See, Fonte v. Board of Managers of Continental Towers Condominium, 848 F.2d 24, 25 (2d 
Cir. 1988). Thus, although the Treasury Amendment exemption may be applicable, such an argument is premature at this time."
1321,19," Defendants also argue that plaintiffs' CEA claim should be dismissed under Rule 9(b), F.R.Civ.P.. While courts apply Rule 
9(b), F.R.Civ.P., to § 4 of the CEA, see, e.g., Karasyk v. Marc Commodities Corp., 770 F. Supp. 824, 829 (S.D.N.Y. 1991) 
(Haight, J.), the antifraud provision of the CEA, no court has determined whether Rule 9(b), F.R.Civ.P. applies to § 9(b) of the 
CEA, the manipulation provision. Although the Supreme Court in Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 47 L. Ed. 2d 668, 96 
S. Ct. 1375 (1976), has defined ""manipulation"" under § 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act as ""intentional or willful conduct 
designed to deceive or defraud,"" whether the same definition should be applied to § 9(b) of the CEA is an interesting question "
1322,," given the existence of a separate antifraud section in the CEA. However, there is no need to reach this issue since plaintiffs CEA 
claim has been dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), F.R.Civ.P.."
1322,20," See also U.S. v. Indelicato, 865 F.2d 1370, 1383-4 (2d Cir. 1989)."
1322,21," See, e.g., Barrett v. United States Banknote Corporation, 806 F. Supp. 1094, 1101 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) (Patterson, J) (plaintiff's 
allegations did not suggest that defendants' acts were a regular way of conducting its ongoing legitimate business). "
1323,22," The complaint alleges in a purely conclusory manner that all the defendants ""would have persisted indefinitely in their 
unlawful schemes had their conduct not been discovered by federal regulators."" Complaint P 115, 127, and 151. However, the 
complaint provides no basis for this conclusion insofar as the Soros and Caxton defendants are concerned. By contrast, the 
complaint does allege that ""At least one defendant, Salomon, has engaged in a pattern of manipulating the Treasury securities 
issued at other Treasury auctions from August 1989 until August 1991."" Complaint P 46. In addition, the Steinhardt defendants 
allegedly participated in both the April and May schemes."
1323,23," See, e.g., U.S. v. Kaplan, 886 F.2d 536, 543 (2d Cir. 1989) HN17[
] (""where external facts . . . demonstrate a defendant's 
continuing intent and ability to participate in various ways in the corruption of the enterprise, a trier of fact may find that the 
predicate acts entail a threat of continuing racketeering activity.""); Langer v. Barclays Bank of New York, No. 91 Civ. 3515 
(LMM), 1992 WL 296410, *4 (S.D.N.Y. October 2, 1992) (McKenna, J.)."

1323,25," 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) defines an enterprise as HN18[
] ""any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal 
entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity""."
1323,26," Without citing any caselaw, Caxton also argues that the Relevant Markets in United States Treasury Notes are not 
appropriate enterprises because defendants could not possibly exercise ""control"" over them within the meaning of § 1962(b). 
However, ""control"" like the other RICO elements must be read broadly, see, e.g., Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473 U.S. 
479, 497-98, 87 L. Ed. 2d 346, 105 S. Ct. 3275 (1985); c.f. United States v. Jacobson, 691 F.2d 110, 112-13 (2d Cir. 1982) 
(reading ""interest in"" in § 1962(b) broadly), and surely encompasses the ability to manipulate at issue here. "
1324,27," Cullen v. Margiotta, 811 F.2d 698, 730 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 483 U.S. 1021 (1987), cited by plaintiffs, is not to the contrary. 
That case held that ""the same entity may be both a RICO 'person' and a member of the 'enterprise.'"" (emphasis added) Thus, in 
Cullen, the enterprise was comprised of additional persons."
1324,28," Plaintiffs' Memorandum attempts to recast claim six by suggesting that the ""enterprise"" there alleged is not SFM, but an 
association-in-fact of all defendants. Plaintiffs cannot cure their pleading deficiency in this misleading manner. The sixth cause of 
action clearly defines Soros as an ""Individual Defendant,"" SFM as an ""enterprise,"" and alleges that ""The Individual Defendants . . 
. conducted the affairs of their respective enterprises through a pattern of racketeering."" (emphasis added) PP 143, 144, 147."
1324,29," The Caxton Defendants further argue that the plaintiffs have not demonstrated that their injury was proximately caused by the 
RICO violation because plaintiffs increased their April Two-Year short position after concluding that the market was being 
manipulated. For the reasons set forth in the above discussion of the § 10(b) claim, Caxton's theory must be rejected at this 
stage in the litigation. Reading the complaint in the light most favorable to nonmovant, proximate cause is adequately alleged. 
See Complaint P 69. Compare Sperber v. Boesky, 849 F.2d 60, 64-65 (2d Cir. 1988)."
1324,30," Rule 9(b), F.R.Civ.P., applies to these RICO claims because the alleged predicate acts are fraud in the sale of securities, mail 
fraud and wire fraud. See, e.g., Lou v. Belzberg, 728 F. Supp. 1010, 1025 (S.D.N.Y. 1990) (Sweet, J.)."
1324,31," Section 1 of the Sherman Act HN21[
] makes ""every contract, combination . . . or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations . . . illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. Section 2 makes it unlawful to 
""monopolize or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the 
trade or commerce among the several states . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 2. Pursuant to Section 4 of the Clayton Act, private civil action 
may be brought by any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust 
laws . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 15."
1324,32," Rule 8(a), F.R.Civ.P. provides, in pertinent part, ""A pleading which sets forth a claim for relief . . . shall contain . . . a short 
plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief . . ."" "
1325,33," ""Other than Rule 9, which governs a limited number of particular matters, there are no special pleading provisions in the 
Federal Rules."" 5 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, Civil 2d § 1221. The Nagler opinion, reversing dismissal of an 
antitrust case for failure to state a claim, was written by Chief Judge Charles E. Clark, the principal draftsman of the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure. He noted, ""When the rules were adopted there was considerable pressure for separate provisions in 
[certain] special types of litigation. Such arguments did not prevail; instead there was adopted a uniform system for all cases[.]"" 
Nagler v. Admiral Corp., 248 F.2d 319, 322-23 (2d Cir. 1957); Wright & Miller § 1221."
1325,34," Defendants' reliance on Heart Disease Research Foundation v. General Motors Corp., 463 F.2d 98 (2d Cir. 1972), dismissing 
a poorly plead antitrust claim, is misplaced. As Judge Lasker noted in Minpeco, S.A. v. Conticommodity Services Inc., 552 F. 
Supp. 327, 331 (S.D.N.Y. 1982), ""The complaint in Heart Disease Research was described by the Court of Appeals as 'sloppy,' 
'scattershot' and 'frivolously drawn.' . . . Moreover, the Heart court did not rule that the facts alleged in support of the conspiracy 
claim were insufficient; it stated that 'no facts [were] alleged.' (emphasis added)."" Similarly, the cases from other circuits cited by 
defendants are inapposite. In Mountain View Pharmacy v. Abbott Labs, 630 F.2d 1383, 1385 (10th Cir. 1980) the complaint 
merely ""used statutory language to describe the alleged antitrust violations without including any factual allegations whatsoever"". 
In Lombard's, Inc. v. Prince Manufacturing, Inc., 753 F.2d 974, 975 (11th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1082, 88 L. Ed. 2d 
892, 106 S. Ct. 851 (1986), the antitrust allegations were merely conclusory. In Vermilion Foam Products Co. v. General Electric 
Co., 386 F. Supp. 255, 257-59 (E.D.Mich. 1974), the complaint ""which rambled over a series of related and unrelated events,"" 
contained a dearth of allegations to support the antitrust claim."
1325,35," In contrast, the thin allegations in the complaint fall far short of the evidence that is needed to prove an antitrust violation. See, 
e.g., Venture Technology v. National Fuel Gas Co., 685 F.2d 41, 45-46 (2d Cir.) HN25[
] (attendance at meetings and the 
opportunity to conspire are insufficient to prove conspiracy), cert. denied 459 U.S. 1007, 74 L. Ed. 2d 398, 103 S. Ct. 362 (1982); 
cf. Hunt v. Mobil Oil Co., 465 F. Supp. 195, 230-231 (S.D.N.Y. 1978) (Weinfeld, J.), aff'd without op., 610 F.2d 806 (2d Cir. 
1979). See also Theatre Enterprises v. Paramount Film Distributing Corp., 346 U.S. 537, 541, 98 L. Ed. 273, 74 S. Ct. 257 "
1326,," (1954) (circumstantial evidence of parallel behavior is not enough to demonstrate conspiracy for the purposes of the Sherman 
Act); Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775, 104 S. Ct. 1464 (1984)."
1326,36," The Caxton defendants also claim that the alleged injury to plaintiffs is not of the type the antitrust laws were designed to 
protect against because plaintiffs do not allege an injury to anyone but themselves. HN26[
] Injury to one competitor does not 
constitute ""restraint of trade."" Telectronics Proprietary, Ltd. v. Medtronic, Inc., 687 F. Supp. 832 at 837, 838 n.9. The complaint 
does, however, allege injury to other ""short"" investors P 69, and, in any event, the complaint clearly supports the inference that 
defendants caused ""antitrust injury"" to overall competition in the Relevant Markets. Id. The court is also not persuaded by Caxton's argument that the antitrust allegations, even if true, do not render Kovner or Luttrell 
liable as participants. Caxton relies on New York v. Dairylea Coop. Inc., 570 F. Supp. 1213, 1216 (S.D.N.Y. 1983) (Owen, J.); 
however that complaint, which was adequately pleaed as to the corporate defendants, merely recited as to the individuals their 
type of employment with the defendant corporations, their home addresses and nothing more. In the present case, Kovner and 
Luttrell purportedly convened and played a key role in the meeting at which the alleged conspiracy was fomented. These 
allegations will suffice to survive a motion to dismiss."
1326,37," Plaintiff Hauptfuhrer also alleges that the defendants manipulated the Treasury market ""with reckless disregard for the fact 
that their conduct would cause him to suffer severe emotional distress."" However, New York does not permit recovery for 
emotional distress inflicted recklessly but not intentionally. Garland v. Herrin, 724 F.2d 16, 21 (2d Cir. 1983). "
1327,38," In their Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss plaintiffs' common law fraud claim, the Caxton defendants argue that the complaint 
does not properly allege that their conduct was the proximate cause of plaintiffs' loss. Caxton's argument is based upon the 
same reasoning which the court rejected in the above consideration of Caxton's motion to dismiss the Securities Exchange Act 
claim; there is no need to repeat that discussion here. "
1328,39," [**54]  Consideration of the purpose of Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(i), F.R.Civ.P., supports plaintiffs' contention that Salzberg was 
mistaken as to the provision of Rule 4 by which defendant Soros was served. Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(i), F.R.Civ.P. HN33[
] is 
designed to enable federal courts to take advantage of state long-arm statutes which commonly permit personal service without 
the state in a variety of instances in which defendant has had some contact with the state. 4 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice 
and Procedure: Civil 2d, § 1112, at 229 (1987). Salzberg states in the Affidavit of Service that he delivered the summons and 
First Amended Complaint to Soros' Manhattan residence. As this court is also within New York State, plaintiffs clearly had no 
need for service without New York State with respect to Soros. Thus, plaintiffs had no reason to rely on the more cumbersome 
service requirements of Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(i), F.R.Civ.P., and CPLR § 308(2). "
1332,*," Honorable Rudi M. Brewster, United States District Judge for the Southern District of California, sitting by designation. "
1333,1," Olin views the CA production facility as a separate asset for which a separate antitrust analysis should apply. However, as we 
discuss below, the proper perspective is to view the acquisition as a whole. Whether Olin should be allowed to keep the CA 
facility is a question we leave for consideration along with the appropriateness of the divestiture remedy ordered by the 
Commission. "
1334,2," One apparent flaw in the Commission's analysis of the ISOS-only market lies in its conclusion that ""the level of concentration in 
the [ISOS]-only market proposed by Olin is . . . very high."" In coming to this conclusion, the Commission did not provide any 
discussion similar to its analysis of the dry sanitizers market. In analyzing the post-acquisition dry sanitizers market, the 
Commission concluded that Olin's production capacity would be 57% of a market in which the ""four-firm concentration ratio"" was 
95%. Nevertheless, there is evidence supporting the Commission's conclusion regarding likely anti-competitive effect on the 
ISOS-only market. It appears that Olin's post-acquisition share of production capacity in an ISOS-only market would be 48%, 
with a ""four-firm concentration ratio"" of 99.7%. "
1336,3," Since this case was submitted, the Justice Department and the Commission have jointly revised their merger guidelines. See 
Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission, Horizontal Merger Guidelines (Apr. 1992), reprinted in 4Trade Reg. Rep. 
(CCH) Par. 13,104. This revision has not substantially changed the five-percent test as it applies in this case. Compare id. § 1.1, 
reprinted in 4Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH) Par. 13,104, at 20,572-73 with United States Department of Justice, Merger Guidelines - 
1984 § 2.11, reprinted in 4Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH) Par. 13,103, at 20556-57. See generally 4Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH) Par. 
13,104, at 20,569."
1336,4," In 1982, the Commission issued its first set of merger guidelines. The stated purpose for doing so was ""to express its collective 
judgment of the reasons why it supports changes in the 1968 [DOJ] Guidelines and to highlight the principal considerations that "
1337,," will guide its horizontal merger enforcement."" FTC Statement Concerning Horizontal Mergers pt. I (1982), reprinted in 4Trade 
Reg. Rep. (CCH) Par. 13,200, at 20,901. The Commission guidelines did not refer to the five-percent test, though they did 
indicate that ""the Department of Justice's 1982 revisions to the 1968 Guidelines will be given considerable weight by the 
Commission."" Id., reprinted in 4Trade Reg. Rep (CCH) Par. 13,200, at 20,901. Of course, the Commission has now embraced 
the five-percent test. See supra note 3."
1337,5," In discussing these characteristics, the Commission apparently assumed that the relevant market is defined in terms of 
consumers who maintain their own pools. Although Olin challenges this assumption, we conclude there is substantial evidence 
in support of dealing with residential consumers as a distinct market. "
1338,6, The Commission has provided the following table: [SEE TABLE IN ORIGINAL]
1338,*," PRICE TO REPACKER; ** CARLOAD PRICE TO HTH DISTRIBUTOR ""HTH,"" referred to in the chart, is Olin's brand of CAL/HYPO. The chart shows that, over time, as the price of CAL/HYPO 
increased relative to ISOS, more and more people switched to ISOS. Olin disputes whether this is truly evidence of cross-
elasticity, in view of the fact that the Japanese were dumping ISOS on the American market, and that the switch from 
CAL/HYPO to ISOS occurred over several years. "
1339,7," It appears that the Commission regards the narrowing in the price gap as indicative of what would happen in a truly competitive 
market. Olin, on the other hand, argues that the reduced gap in price was artificial and that, once dumping was stopped in 1984, 
the gap widened to its ""traditional"" level. Whether the competitive effects of the antidumping orders can be accurately assessed, 
however, is uncertain given that the acquisition here in question was arranged within a year of the antidumping orders, and was 
consummated soon thereafter. "
1340,8," Olin's efforts to include liquid pool bleach in the relevant product market are intended to undermine the Commission's reliance 
on a dry sanitizers market in ordering divestiture. "
1341,9," On appeal, the Commission argues that, even if Olin's pre-acquisition ISOS market share is excluded from the analysis of the 
dry sanitizers market and only its pre-acquisition CAL/HYPO business and FMC's pre-acquisition ISOS business are considered, 
the merger would still violate federal antitrust law. Although the ALJ apparently agreed, the Commission did not explicitly 
consider this argument in its opinion. Therefore, we will not review it here."
1341,10," Ease of market entry is relevant in antitrust cases because even a monopolist will not be able to exercise power over price in a 
market that is easily entered by potential competitors. The assumption is that, in an easily entered market, an artificial increase 
in price will entice bystanders to enter the market, eventually restoring competitive conditions."
1341,11," Interestingly, as in the present case, the lower tribunal in Baker Hughes did not explicitly indicate what standard it had applied 
in assessing the defendants' rebuttal. See 908 F.2d at 983. "
1347,1," The original notice period was 180 days. This was reduced to 30 days in March or April 1991. It appears, at least in practice, 
that a doctor could switch to non-exclusive status more rapidly by returning some of the extra compensation previously paid. "
1348,2," Tying is sometimes also described as a per se offense but, since some element of power must be shown and defenses are 
effectively available, ""quasi"" per se might be a better label. See Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc., 119 L. 
Ed. 2d 265, 112 S. Ct. 2072 (1992). "
1350,3," Even with no notice period, Healthsource's differential pricing policy--paying more to those who exclusively serve Healthsource-
-would disadvantage competing HMOs. Some courts hesitate to apply the exclusivity label to such arrangements because there 
is no continuing promise not to deal (see Antitrust Developments, supra, at 176), but the differential pricing plan is 
unquestionably part of a contract and so subject to section 1, whatever label may be applied."
1350,4," Two examples of these staff notes give their flavor: ""Looking at '90 rates - and a deterent [sic] to joining other HMOs (like 
Healthcare)""; and ""amend contract (sending this or next week) based on exclusivity. HMOs only (careful about restraint of trade) 
will be sent to even those in Healthcare already . . . ."" "
1351,5," On the other hand, we do not accept U.S. Healthcare's effort to salvage something from the decision by arguing the magistrate 
judge found substantial foreclosure in fact. For the most part, the statements to which it points appear to us to be efforts by the 
magistrate judge to describe the allegations made by U.S. Healthcare."
1351,6," See, e.g., Dep't of Justice Merger Guidelines, PP 4.21, 4.213, June 14, 1984, 49 FR 26824, 26835-36 (1984), adopting this 
position. The 1992 DOJ-FTC guidelines are directed only to horizontal mergers and do not address the issue.  49 FR 26823 
(1992). "
1352,7," U.S. Healthcare, of course, is not concerned with Healthsource's ability as a monopsonist to exploit doctors; it is concerned 
with its own ability to find doctors to serve it. The latter question--one of foreclosure--depends on the available supply of doctors, 
the constraint imposed by the exclusivity clause, the prospect for entry of new doctors into the market, and similar issues. 
Whether U.S. Healthcare is foreclosed, however, does not depend on whether consumers treat HMOs as a part of health care 
financing or as a unique and separate product. "
1365,1, An EMG is a medical diagnostic test used to evaluate nerve and muscle functions.
1365,2," Throughout his second amended complaint (Doc. # 36), Plaintiff refers to the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 
(""HCQIA""), 42 U.S.C. § 11111 et seq, and Defendants' failure to comply with it. The Court does not read Plaintiff's second 
amended complaint as asserting a claim for damages against Defendants for the asserted violation of the HCQIA. Rather, the 
Court interprets the allegations as a contention that Defendants are not entitled to rely upon the immunity set forth in the Act. 
However, even if the Court's interpretation of Plaintiff's second amended complaint is incorrect, Plaintiff does not have a claim 
for damages under the HCQIA. Under certain circumstances, that legislation provides immunity to those who conduct 
professional peer review. While the immunity may disappear when the peer review is not conducted in accordance with the 
standards set forth therein, the HCQIA does not impose duties upon those who participate in peer review, the breach of which 
provides a remedy to a medical professional who claims to have been harmed by peer review that is inadequate. In other words, 
there is not an implied private right of action under the HCQIA for a medical professional who claims to have been harmed by a 
peer review process which did not comport with the procedural protections provided by the Act. See e.g., Goldsmith v. Harding 
Hospital, Inc., 762 F. Supp. 187 (S.D.Ohio 1991). "
1366,3," The parties have stipulated that the relevant geographic market consists of Montgomery and Preble counties, as well as 
portions of Miami, Greene, Warren, Butler and Darke counties."
1366,4," Even if the Plaintiff had continued to claim the relevant product market as the provision of all osteopathic neurological services, 
and, thus, challenged the Defendants' proposed narrowing of the market definition, the Court would have concluded that such 
narrowing was proper. That narrowing is fully supported by the affidavit of Defendants' expert witness. Neurological services are 
a laundry list of services provided by a neurologist. An EMG is but one of those services, and Plaintiff has lost his privileges at 
the Defendant hospitals only for the conducting of EMGs. It would simply make no sense to define the product market broadly 
when the Plaintiff has lost his privileges only to perform EMGs. Moreover, one could argue that this narrow definition of the "
1367,," product market construes the evidence in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff. During his deposition of May 5, 1992, Plaintiff 
testified that he was in competition with virtually every medical practitioner. If the market were defined as the provision of all 
osteopathic neurological services, there would be hundreds of medical practitioners competing with the Plaintiff. Indeed, if the 
market were so broadly defined, no practitioner or group of practitioners could possibly possess the requisite market power to 
have engaged in an attempt to monopolize in violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act."
1367,5," The affidavit of Defendants' expert witness, Barbara Epstein, demonstrates that Grandview competes with allopathic hospitals 
for patients."
1367,6," In an effort to demonstrate that the question of the relevant market raises a genuine issue of material fact, the Plaintiff also 
cites litigation, in the Court of Common Pleas for Montgomery County, between Grandview and Western Ohio Health 
Corporation over the latter's termination of the former. The Plaintiff does not furnish pleadings or other papers from that litigation 
which would tend to demonstrate that the market for EMGs performed and interpreted by doctors of osteopathic medicine is a 
different market than that for EMGs performed and interpreted by medical doctors. The Court considers the controversy between 
Grandview and Western Ohio to indicate that the relevant market herein is the performance of all EMGs. If there were a 
distinction between osteopathic medicine and allopathic medicine, with regard to EMGs, Western Ohio Health could not have 
terminated Grandview's right to participate, while continuing to maintain its customer base. "
1368,7," The relevant geographic market is set forth in footnote 1, supra."
1368,8," In concluding as a matter of law that the element of dangerous probability had not been met, the Richter court looked not only 
at the defendant's market share but also to the fact that its market share was declining. The combined market share of Plaintiff 
and Smith in 1986 was 23.7%. That combined market share decreased to 18.5% and 17% in 1987 and 1988, respectively."
1368,9, Empire Gas was cited with approval by the Sixth Circuit in Richter and Langenderfer.
1368,10," In another context, $ 10,000 might be considered a barrier to entry; however, in this case, that price is not a barrier. For 
instance, in 1986, the average price which Plaintiff charged for performing EMGs was nearly $ 500."
1368,11, There is no evidence that there was less potential competition in the market place in 1986 than in 1991. 
1369,12," Because the Court has concluded that the Defendants' probability of successfully monopolizing the EMG market does not 
raise a genuine issue of material fact, it is not necessary to consider whether genuine issues of material fact exist as to the other 
elements of an attempt to monopolize claim, to wit: intent to monopolize and anticompetitive conduct."
1369,13," HN9[
] Price fixing is a per se violation of § 1 regardless of whether the price fixed is a minimum or, as is alleged in this case, a maximum price. Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society, 457 U.S. 332, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48, 102 S. Ct. 2466 (1982)."
1369,14," As is noted above, Plaintiff did not lose his privileges because he refused to engage in a price fixing conspiracy; rather, his 
privileges were lost because he refused to agree with requirements that his performance of EMGs be monitored for a short 
period of time and that he take additional education regarding that diagnostic test. Nonetheless, for purposes of ruling on the 
instant motion, the Court will assume for sake of argument that these requirements were imposed upon the Plaintiff because he 
refused to engage in price fixing."
1369,15," This argument and the Court's analysis of it applies equally to Plaintiff's other § 1 claim, that of a group boycott, infra. "
1370,16," HN15[
] Section 4 of the Clayton Act is the statute which permits a private person to file a lawsuit seeking monetary 
damages for violations of the Sherman Act. "
1371,17," The Indiana Grocery court indicated that the rule would not apply when predatory pricing was present. 684 F. Supp. at 583. 
Predatory pricing is ""pricing below some appropriate measure of cost."" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 584-85 n. 8. In the present case, 
there is no allegation that the maximum price which the Defendants allegedly sought to have the Plaintiff charge was a predatory 
price. Indeed, it was the price charged by allopathic practitioners for EMGs. "
1372,18," Because the Court has concluded that the Plaintiff has not suffered an antitrust injury and, thus, does not have standing, it is 
not necessary to consider whether there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Defendants engaged in a price 
fixing conspiracy. Nevertheless, in accordance with the standards for resolving such a question, which were established in 
Matsushita, supra, and which are set forth below, this Court has grave concerns whether such a fact question does exist. First, 
Plaintiff is entitled only to reasonable inferences from the evidence. It is simply not a reasonable inference that the Defendants, 
as part of a price fixing conspiracy, imposed the requirements upon Plaintiff, with which he choose not to abide, thus leading to 
the loss of his privileges. The individual Defendants are, in the main, practitioners who do not compete with the Plaintiff. Thus, it 
is not economically reasonable that they would engage in a conspiracy to fix prices in a market in which they are not 
participants. Indeed, if the prices charged by the Plaintiff were too high, the Defendants could avoid that problem simply by not 
referring patients to the Plaintiff. Second, even if a price fixing conspiracy is a reasonable inference, there is no evidence to 
support such a conspiracy which is not equally indicative of unilateral conduct. For instance, in his second amended complaint, 
Plaintiff complains of the peer review process instituted against him. This process is equally indicative of unilateral conduct as it 
is of concerted activity. None can question that Grandview had the obligation to investigate the serious charges lodged against 
the Plaintiff, a member of its staff. Some of the Plaintiff's EMG reports were reviewed by outside experts, who raised questions 
regarding his work. The recommendation of the review panel, which was adopted by Grandview's Staff Executive Committee, 
was that the Plaintiff's work be monitored and that he obtain additional education regarding the performance of EMGs. It was 
only after Plaintiff refused to accept the recommendations that his staff privileges were revoked. Moreover, Plaintiff could have 
had his privileges reinstated if he had followed the recommendations. Additionally, statements made to the Plaintiff during an 
investigation of him by the Ethics Committee of the Dayton District Academy of Osteopathic Medicine that he should charge no 
more for an EMG than that which medical doctors charged are equally indicative of unilateral activity as they are of a conspiracy 
to fix prices. They are simple statements that Plaintiff's patients will not be happy paying more for his services than other 
practitioners charge for the same service or than insurance companies will cover."
1372,19," Defendants also argue that, as a result of the intra-corporate conspiracy doctrine, they are not capable of conspiring. For 
reasons set forth above, the Court rejects that argument. "
1373,20," Those who ceased referring patients to Plaintiff are both some of the individual Defendants and others who are not 
Defendants. There was also evidence that the Plaintiff continues to receive referrals. During his May 5, 1992, deposition, Plaintiff 
testified that 90-95% of his current medical practice consists of referrals. According to Plaintiff's testimony, more of those 
referrals came from osteopaths than from medical doctors."
1373,21," Plaintiff repeatedly testified that certain physicians who had stopped referring patients to him did so because of the cost he 
charged to perform an EMG."
1373,22," When asked during his July 27, 1992, deposition what evidence he had that the physicians at Grandview had agreed not to 
refer patients to him, Plaintiff, in addition to the fall-off of referrals, mentioned an incident in May, 1988, when he sought to 
address the entire medical staff at Grandview and was refused permission. That the Plaintiff was not allowed to address the 
medical staff does not raise an inference that there exists or existed a conspiracy to stop referrals to the Plaintiff. Additionally, 
Plaintiff mentioned a preference list which existed at Grandview. However, all evidence relating to that list was that an individual 
practitioner determined whether his or her name was to be placed upon it. The technician in the EEG department where the list 
was located told the Plaintiff that a practitioner would call her and tell her to put his or her name on the list. Therefore, the 
existence of the list does not support an inference of concerted activity."
1373,23," Of course, some of this fall-off was certain to occur because Plaintiff had lost his privileges. In other words, it was no longer 
possible for Plaintiff to perform an EMG which had to be performed or, for that matter, was more conveniently performed at 
Grandview or Southview. "
1374,24," Plaintiff cites certain statements regarding the prices he charged which were made to him in connection with a proceeding 
before the Ethics Committee of the Dayton District Academy of Osteopathic Medicine. The Court does not consider these 
statements to be relevant to an alleged conspiracy to maintain a group boycott. Moreover, as the Court has explained above, 
these statements are equally indicative of unilateral activity as they are of concerted activity. See Footnote 18, supra."
1374,25, Plaintiff as the party opposing a motion for summary judgment is entitled to only reasonable inferences.
1374,26," In an effort to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact regarding a conspiracy to maintain a group 
boycott, Plaintiff refers to a memorandum from Robert D. Berger, D.O., then vice president for medical affairs for Grandview and 
Southview, to Richard J. Minor, then president and CEO of Grandview and Southview. In the memorandum, Berger addresses 
the investigation of Plaintiff then being conducted by the Ethics Committee of the Dayton District Academy of Osteopathic 
Medicine. Berger tells Minor that ""if the Ethics Committee fails to act we can pursue it [an investigation of Plaintiff] ourselves."" 
This memorandum is not indicative of concerted activity. On the contrary, it demonstrates that Grandview and Southview were 
not acting in concert with the Dayton District Academy of Osteopathic Medicine because officers of Grandview and Southview 
mention the potential need to investigate Plaintiff if the Ethics Committee fails to resolve the matter. "

1379,2," Jane Slowiak asserts a marital property interest as Dennis Slowiak's wife. For simplicity, we refer to the plaintiffs as ""Slowiak."" 
Slowiak also sued Hudson Foods for violations of the Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law, Wis. Stat. § 135.02 (1989-90), but after a 
jury returned a verdict in Slowiak's favor on his Fair Dealership claim, Hudson and Slowiak reached a settlement agreement 
covering all claims. Appellants' Brief at 4. "
1380,3," Slowiak alleged he was injured because he could not charge his customers higher prices. Without fixed prices, he claimed that 
he could have charged higher prices because of his monopoly position as a Schweigert distributor. The court ruled that the 
Wisconsin antitrust laws were not designed to redress this form of injury, and granted summary judgment in favor of Land 
O'Lakes. "
1409,1," Pan American World Airways, Inc. (""Pan Am"") and Midway Airlines, Inc. (""Midway"") were also originally named in this action. 
Subsequent to the institution of the litigation, Continental, Midway, Pan Am and TWA all sought the protection of the bankruptcy 
courts. Midway and Pan Am have ceased doing business."
1409,2," Burdened by overcapacity, the recent recession, and fare wars, the airline industry has sustained billions in losses since 1990. 
Standard & Poor Corporation recently lowered the debt ratings of American, Delta, and United to speculative grade because of 
the dismal financial condition of the U.S. airline industry."
1409,3," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), the 11th Circuit adopted as binding precedent the 
decisions of the former 5th Circuit handed down prior to September 30, 1981. "
1410,4," In view of the precarious financial position of most of the major airlines and the escalation and maze of fares occurring after 
deregulation, serious consideration should be given to reregulation of the industry to restore the ""just and reasonable"" rule to 
domestic airline pricing."
1410,5," Subsequent to the 21 original filings, another 15 actions were filed in various jurisdictions and transferred to this district, and 6 
additional actions were filed in Atlanta for a total of 42 actions."
1410,6," Specifically, plaintiffs contend that the airline defendants each send information regarding their prospective fare changes to 
ATPCO. Those prices and other information are integrated into the ATPCO computer system. Each of the defendant airlines 
checks its computers on a daily, hourly, or minute-by-minute basis in order to ascertain whether any prospective fare changes 
have been proposed by other airlines. Plaintiffs allege that when a proposed fare increase, effective at a future date, appears in 
the system, it constitutes an offer to the other airlines to agree to the price level proposed. Under the agreement, if other airlines 
do not accept the offer and match the increase, the proposing airline will pull the increase from the system. The airlines allegedly 
manifest their acceptance of the offer by entering a fare into the ATPCO system that matches the offer in amount and effective 
date. Plaintiffs also allege that other signaling practices facilitated a conspiracy to fix prices. "
1411,7," For a detailed examination of defendants' arguments and the expert testimony presented on the certification issues, see In re 
Domestic Air Transp. Litig., 137 F.R.D. 677 (N.D. Ga. 1991)."
1411,8," Defendants sought appellate review of that portion of the Court's notice order requiring publication of class notice in the in-
flight magazines carried on defendants' airplanes and the posting of notice in defendants' ticket offices, claiming a violation of 
the airlines' First Amendment right to freedom of speech. Based on their assertion that the list of names obtained from credit 
card numbers (the ""TRW list"") was a list of class members, defendants also argued that the Court had erred in failing to order 
plaintiffs to give individual notice to the names and addresses on that list. In addition, defendants' appeal encompassed the 
issue of whether notice ordered by the Court was materially misleading to the extent it left open the possibility of a class-wide or 
lump sum judgment following a trial of common issues. The appeal had been fully briefed and scheduled for argument by the 
time the final pending settlements were reached and the parties thus entered into a Consent Motion for Stay of Appeal, which 
was granted on June 29, 1992. "
1412,9," While the initial settlement with TWA did not provide for interchangeable coupons, counsel for plaintiffs and TWA negotiated 
an amendment to the initial agreement providing that the coupons would be interchangeable and amending the TWA settlement 
class to conform it to that described in the most recent agreement. No other terms of the TWA agreement were changed. "
1413,10," The $ 11.5 million in Northwest certificates will be distributed based on the response of claimants who indicate that they prefer 
Northwest certificates. The base and supplemental funds, combined with the Northwest certificates, amount to a total certificate 
settlement with a face value of $ 408 million."
1413,11," The settlement agreement with America, Delta, United, and USAir provides that the Settlement Administration Committee 
shall have responsibility for providing notice to the class, communicating with the class, and administering the cash fund and 
various settlements, all subject to Court approval. By Order dated September 23, 1993, the Court appointed a Settlement 
Administration Committee whose membership had been recommended by the parties. The committee has worked to clarify for "
1414,," the class many of the terms of the agreement, has selected a claims administrator to administer the settlements, and has 
developed an information program to assist the class in understanding the settlements and in filing their claims."
1414,12," As of December 31, 1992, approximately $ 7,039,991.73 of the cash settlement fund had been expended on administrative 
expenses. The majority of this amount was expended to issue publication and mail notice to the class. "
1415,13," In the original Chicago class action, plaintiffs alleged that certain airlines charged passengers enplaning in Chicago on flights 
originating in Chicago a jet fuel tax surcharge that far exceeded the amount of the tax levied by the City. The action eventually 
charged violations of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, common law fraud, deceit and 
misrepresentation, and violation of the Illinois antitrust laws."
1415,14," The individuals or organizations that have moved to intervene or to appear amicus curiae in this action include: American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc; American Society of Travel Agents; Armstrong World Industries, 
Inc.; Leeann Bauder, et al.; Coalition for Concerned Travelers; Andrew Hudders, et al.; Management Travel Consultants, 
Inc.; Travel Agents of the Carolinas, Inc.; Public Citizen, Ralph Nader, and the Center for Study of Responsive Law; and the 
Government of the United States Virgin Islands."
1415,15, The Court and all of its relatives within the third degree necessarily elected to exclude themselves from the settlement class. 
1416,16," After consulting with the Court and several travel agency representatives, the Settlement Administration Committee has also 
undertaken an additional information campaign aimed at the settlement class to ensure maximum participation by the class in 
the claims process. See Order dated 22, 1993. "
1417,17," In approving these settlements, the Court will examine the settlements collectively to determine if in the aggregate, they are 
fair, adequate, and reasonable. The settlements were presented by the parties as a collective recovery for the class totaling $ 
458 million. It is appropriate to evaluate the settlements collectively as plaintiffs negotiated each of the settlements as a part of a 
comprehensive strategy to maximize class recovery from all of the defendants. According to the plaintiffs, the earlier ""ice-
breaker"" settlements were a necessary preliminary step to their obtaining settlements from the remaining, more lucrative 
defendants. In addition, ""the fairest and most reasonable measure of the adequacy of the settlements depends on assessing the 
total damages suffered by the class resulting from the conduct of all the defendants taken together collectively, and comparing 
that with the total amount to be paid by the defendants."" In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litig., 643 F.2d 195, 212 (5th Cir. 
1981). The Court's finding that the settlements viewed collectively are fair, adequate and reasonable does not imply that the 
settlements would not withstand individual scrutiny. To the contrary, the Court finds each individual settlement is suitable for 
approval as well. The Court, however, will examine the settlements in the form presented by the proponents to determine the 
actual benefit to individual class members. "
1418,18," The parties conducted extensive discovery during the course of the action, with the bulk of the deposition discovery occurring 
after the Court's decision regarding notice. Defendants initially served written discovery limited to class certification issues on 
each of the named plaintiffs and subsequently noticed the deposition of twenty-six of the named plaintiffs. Class counsel filed a 
motion for protective order seeking to restrict the number of plaintiffs who could be deposed for class certification purposes, and 
the Court ultimately permitted the deposition of twelve of the named plaintiffs. Before multidistrict transfer, defendants' counsel 
had already taken the depositions of three plaintiffs. Consequently, in total, 15 plaintiffs were deposed. Ultimately, plaintiffs reviewed more than 1.6 million pages of documents, 400,000 of which were copied, parts of which were 
stored in a computerized depository. After the Court's stay of the notice program, the parties proceeded with the completion of 
mutual fact discovery which expired on June 15, 1992. Plaintiffs conducted deposition discovery in two stages: initial 30(b)(6) 
depositions of each defendant and a subsequent massive deposition push over a five-month period in the spring of 1992, during 
which teams of plaintiffs' counsel deposed sixty-eight representatives of defendants and three third parties. Expert discovery was 
to expire on August 24, 1992, and summary judgement papers were slated for filing on September 23, 1992. "
1421,19," This Court ruled that it was premature to determine issues relating to damage methodology in connection with the class 
notice. In re Domestic Air Transp. Litig., 141 F.R.D. 534, 554 (N.D. Ga. 1992). The matter was before the Eleventh Circuit at the 
time of settlement."
1421,20, The following motions were pending at the time of settlement:

1421,3," . Motion for Discovery of Class Members to require each class member who intended to assert a claim to answer 
interrogatories as to whether and by whom the class member was reimbursed for his airline ticket purchases. "
1422,4," . Motion to Decertify Class on the ground that determination of the passing-on defense would involve tens of millions of 
individual issues that would predominate over any common issues and would require decades to try en masse as a class 
action before a jury, an impossible task, thereby making the case unmanageable."
1422,21," Plaintiffs concede that persons who were fully reimbursed for the cost of their airline tickets could not recover any damages 
from defendants. See Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' Motion in Limine filed May 26, 1992, at 3-4."
1422,22," The parties dealt with the passing-on issue in the Settlement Agreements by defining ""purchaser,"" for settlement purposes, as 
the person or entity who paid for the ticket at time of purchase, unless that person was reimbursed the amount paid for the 
purchase of the ticket pursuant to a preexisting agreement in which case the reimbursing party shall be deemed the purchaser."
1422,23," For example, plaintiff John W. Morse, who purchased at least ten airline tickets on class flights for business travel, charged 
the purchases on his individual American Express card, personally paid the bills, and then obtained reimbursement from his 
company. Morse Dep. at 38, 40."

defendants' total operating revenues were $ 8,824,000,000; class revenues are estimated at $ 4,328,147,000. Class revenues

October 15, 1992. "
1426,27," On January 26, 1993, Objectors Andrew Hudders, et al., filed ""Objectors' Supplemental Comments on Appointment of Expert 
To Establish True Economic Value of Proposed Settlement."" Objector Hudders reiterates his position that the true value of the "
1427,," certificates can be established only by estimating the actual redemption rate and that this can most accurately be done only after 
discovery of prior frequent flyer, certificate, and coupon programs. Objector Hudders predicts a ""very low certification redemption 
rate (e.g., below 25%)"" yet offers little basis for this figure. While objector Hudders agrees with many of Dr. Simonson's 
conclusions, he attacks his finding that the redemption rate range is 50% to 75% and the underlying methodology. Objector 
Hudders makes no real request of the Court, but states that they ""continue to be prepared to take discovery and to work with an 
appropriate impartial expert to develop a realistic estimate of true value."" The Court has had difficulty ascertaining exactly what these objectors seek. Though represented by seemingly qualified counsel, 
these objectors have failed to utilize the tools provided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to obtain the information they 
request and to present their positions. The Court has received far more facsimiles from objectors in the form of letters than 
appropriate briefs and motions making formal requests supported by appropriate legal authority. In the present pleading, it is 
unclear what objectors are requesting and the Court will treat the filing as a response to the affidavits of the experts. It is more in 
the form of a response to the opinions of the experts in this matter. Objectors comments concerning Dr. Golaszewski and 
Professor Rubin come some three months following the submission of their affidavits and on the eve of the Court's decision on 
the settlements. Objectors have not presented their own qualified expert refuting the expert conclusions before the Court. They 
remain convinced that discovery concerning the redemption of frequent flyer awards on individual airlines is the key to an 
accurate establishment of a redemption rate. Frequent flyer awards do not enjoy the broad transferability available for the 
present certificates and have many other dissimilarities. See In re Domestic Air Transportation Litigation, 144 F.R.D. 421 (1992). 
While this information might offer some assistance, the Court continues to find the opinion of Dr. Simonson concerning a rough 
range of redemption rates is sufficient for assessing the reasonableness of the settlement. "
1428,28," Affidavits submitted by defendants concerning their financial positions show the following losses: American - fiscal years 1990 and 1991: $ 280 million in losses. Delta - fiscal years 1991 and 1992: $ 1.286 billion in losses. United - fiscal years 1990 and 1991: $ 531 million in losses. USAir - fiscal years 1990 and 1991: $ 759 million in losses. See Affidavits and Class Member Correspondence in Support of Defendants' Brief, filed October 15, 1992."
1428,29," Dr. Golaszewski notes that the defendant airlines have undergone two and one half years of record losses. No carrier 
achieved positive profits for the entire period 1990-92. Dr. Golaszewski reports that Pan Am and Midway have ceased doing 
business and sold their assets, that TWA and Continental are currently in Chapter 11 and their prospects of reorganization are 
uncertain, and that Northwest and USAir have sought major capital infusions from foreign carriers. Nearly 800 jet airliners remain 
idle because of the reduced traffic, and many of the airlines are reducing their fleets and eliminating jobs. Golaszewski Oct. 15th 
Affidavit at 13-16."
1428,30," As the late Professor Newberg noted, ""often, the settlement benefits are speculative in nature and capable of only 
approximate evaluation. Nevertheless, the settlement may be approved if it is clear it secures some adequate advantage for the 
class. The settlement does not have to be a brilliant one in order to secure judicial approval."" 2 Herbert B. Newberg, Newberg on 
Class Actions § 11.45 (1985). "
1429,31," Even if the Court were to rely on the conservative 25% redemption rate suggested by objectors, under which the combined 
settlements would equal 7.6% of the estimated minimum recovery, the Court finds that the settlements are reasonable in light of 
the risks associated with litigation and the precarious financial situation of many of the defendants. See In re Four Seasons 
Securities Laws Litigation, 58 F.R.D. 19, 37 (W.D. Okl. 1972) (court approved a settlement of less than 8% of the estimated 
damages); Mersay v. First Republic Corporation of America, 43 F.R.D. 465 (S.D.N.Y. 1968) (court approved a 5-10% 
settlement)."
1429,32," If, as defendants contend, individual adjudication were required for each class claimant, adjudication of the claims of 2 million 
claimants could last half a millennium. See Defendants' Brief in Support of the Settlement and in Response to Filed Objections, 
filed October 9, 1992, at p. 36. "
1430,33," Notice and claim forms were mailed by first-class mail to the approximately 10 million names and addresses on the TRW list 
supplied by defendants and to all individuals and entities that had written to a post office box previously obtained by plaintiffs' 
counsel or who had otherwise requested to be included on the mailing list. In addition, an approved Summary Notice of 
Pendency of Class Action and Proposed Settlements was published twice between July 30, 1992, and August 6, 1992, in 67 
newspapers in 65 cities in the United States with a combined total readership of over 52 million. As of the Final Fairness Hearing 
held on October 19, 1992, 1.4 million claims forms had been filed and 1.7 requests for claims forms had been received. 
Approximately 2500 individuals requested exclusion from the class, and 773 objections to the settlements had been filed with the 
Court. This number amounts to .00773% of the mailed notices. In addition, the Court has received many letters commenting on 
the settlements which were not filed as formal objections."
1430,34," Objections amount to less than 1/100 of 1% of all class members, whether measured by plaintiffs' estimate of twelve million 
class members or defendants' estimate of fifty million class members. See Phemister v. Harcourt Brace Jovanovitch, Inc., 1984-
2 Trade Cas. (CCH) P 66,234 at 66,993 (N.D. Ill. 1984)."
1430,35," Instead, MTC originally entered the action to object to the prohibition against travel agent redemption."
1430,36, The Eleventh Circuit has outlined the requirements for intervention as of right under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a) 
1431,," The party seeking to intervene as of right under Rule 24 (a)(2) must show that: (1) his application to intervene is timely; (2) 
he has an interest relating to the property or transaction which is a subject of the action; (3) he is so situated that disposition 
of the action, as a practical matter, may impede or impair his ability to protect that interest; and (4) his interest is 
represented inadequately by the existing parties to the suit. Chiles v. Thornburgh, 865 F.2d 1197, 1213 (11th Cir. 1989). The proposed intervenor must establish each of the four 
requirements for intervention as of right. Permissive intervention is proper where ""an applicant's claim or defense and the main 
action have a question of law or fact in common."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b). Whether to permit intervention rests within the Court's 
discretion, and the Court should ""consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice adjudication of the rights of the 
original parties."" Id. MTC's request to intervene in the action for the sole and final purpose of safeguarding commissions does not depend on MTC's 
status as a class member, someone who purchased a class ticket. Instead, MTC's request is as a non-party representing the 
economic self-interest of travel agents. The basis of this litigation is plaintiffs' claims of price fixing of air fares by the airline 
industry and the overcharges to the public resulting from that illegal activity, not the right of the travel agent to a commission. 
The question before the Court is whether the settlement, taken as a whole, is fair, adequate, and reasonable to the class. Not 
whether the agreements are fair to the travel agents. In confirming that under Rule 24(a), a nonparty's interest must be ""direct, substantial, [and] legally protectable,"" the Eleventh 
Circuit recently made clear that an economic interest alone is insufficient to support intervention. By requiring that the applicant's interest be . . . 'legally protectable,' it is plain that something more than an economic 
interest is necessary. What is required is that the interest be one which the substantive law recognizes as belonging to or 
being owned by the applicant. United States v. South Fla. Water Management Dist., 922 F.2d 704, 710 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 116 L. Ed. 2d 356, 112 S. Ct. 
407 (1991). MTC has identified no legally protectable interest in these proceedings, particularly given the elimination of the travel 
agent prohibition. The Court finds that what amounts to an economic arrangement between the travel agents and the airlines on 
the redemption of these certificates does not entitle MTC to intervention. In addition, MTC has presented no argument entitling it 
to permissive intervention. Such intervention would unduly delay and prejudice the interests of the class. "
1432,37," Travel Agents of the Carolinas (""TAC"") is a trade Association of 500 travel agents located in North and South Carolina that 
also appeared at the Fairness Hearing and adopted the positions of ASTA on its objections concerning travel agents. Transcript 
at 105. TAC requested withdrawal of its request for intervention and seeks to proceed on an amicus curiae basis. The Court will 
grant TAC's request to proceed amicus and to withdraw its motion to intervene and finds that TAC no longer objects to the 
approval of the settlement but, along with ASTA, supports the compromise as beneficial to the class. "

1435,39," The Settlement Administration Committee has defined ""round trip"" to include both round trip tickets where the origin and 
destination points are the same, and back-to-back one way tickets for travel that starts and ends at the same point. Report and 
Recommendation of the Settlement Administration Committee, filed January 15, 1993, at 3."
1435,40," The certificates are not redeemable for travel on a very limited number of days surrounding the Thanksgiving, Christmas and 
New Year holidays. These few ""blackout"" days represent a period of heavy travel during which the industry is unable to meet full 
consumer demand. Moreover, tickets sold for those periods represent no more than approximately 3-4% of all domestic tickets. 
See Brief of American, Delta, United, USAir, TWA, Continental, and ATPCO in Support of the Settlement and in Response to 
Filed Objections at 48. Despite objectors' complaint, plaintiffs' expert Dr. Golaszewski reported that the average nonbusiness 
traveler will take more than sufficient flights to redeem all of the base fund certificates, even considering the holiday blackout 
period. See Affidavit of Dr. Richard Golaszewski filed October 15, 1992, at 10. Such a reasonable and limited restriction, 
commonly applied in connection with frequent flyer mileage redemption, in no way renders the settlements inadequate."
1435,41," In addition, the certificates may also be used against purchases of tickets for commuter flights on carriers that are majority 
owned by those settling defendants, such as American Eagle and Air Wisconsin. Unlike promotional coupons, these 
interchangeable certificates are not designed to induce a passenger to switch travel from one carrier to another."
1435,42," The Northwest certificates may also be used at full face value as credit against the price of any published round trip fare 
published by Northwest where the fare exceeds $ 100. While these certificates must be used for travel on Northwest, they 
represent larger redemption amounts than those provided for in the other settlement with a maximum discount exceeding 25% 
off the cost of a round trip fare on Northwest. These certificates are valid for 24 months from the date of mailing, and, as with the 
interchangeable certificates may be applied to the lowest super-saver fare, advanced purchase excursion fare or full business 
fare; and frequent flyer miles are credited to those flights as well. "
1436,43, Simon's allocation argument is similar to that set forth by Armstrong World Industries which is addressed by the Court below.
1436,44," On December 21, 1992, the Justice Department filed a civil antitrust complaint alleging that Alaska Airlines, American, Delta, 
Northwest, TWA, USAir, and ATPCO conspired to fix prices through the use of the ATPCO system by increasing fares, 
eliminating discounted fares, and setting fare restrictions for tickets purchased for travel between cities in the United States. 
United States v. Airline Tariff Publishing Co., No. 92-2854, (D.D.C. filed Dec. 21, 1992). On the same day, the United States, 
United, and USAir filed a Stipulation in which they consented to the entry of a proposed Final Judgment containing prohibitions 
on the conduct of United and USAir. The Justice Department action is substantially similar to the present case and contains 
more detailed allegations of the alleged illegal conduct. "
1437,45," Objectors Saul recently filed a withdrawal of her objections. See Withdrawal of Objections, filed March 11, 1993."
1437,46," In Pretrial Order No. 8, as modified by a subsequent Order dated September 2, 1992, the Court set September 25, 1992, as 
the deadline for filing and serving any objections to the settlements. A procedure for bringing the fact and substance of 
objections to the Court's attention was described in the Notice mailed to class members. Any person who desired to appear at 
the Fairness Hearing had to file a notice of intention to appear, a statement of the position to be asserted and the grounds 
supporting such persons position. Objectors' counsel, Lewis J. Saul, on behalf of Dale Saul and minor children filed a notice to 
appear at and objections to the terms of the settlement on September 24, 1992. The objections of Dale Saul did not address the 
issue of notice. Instead, counsel for the first time at the fairness hearing questioned the sufficiency of notice to foreign claimants 
and later appeared at the meeting of the Settlement Administration Committee to encourage notice of foreign claimants. Two 
weeks following the Fairness Hearing, counsel Saul filed the motion to intervene and to object on behalf of foreign claimants. "
1438,47," The TRW list of possible individual class members did not contain any person with an address outside the U.S., Puerto Rico, 
Guam, or the Virgin Islands. In addition, the published notice was not carried in the international edition of any newspapers or 
periodicals. The summary notice was published in The New York Times, which does have a modest circulation outside of the 
U.S., even though it does not have an international edition."
1438,48," It is not altogether clear that aliens would have any constitutional due process right to notice unless ""they have come within 
the territory of the United States and developed substantial connections with this country."" U.S. v. Rene Martin Verdugo-

1438,49," The fact that some 4,000 notices and claims forms have been requested and mailed to persons in foreign countries is most 
probably in response to the worldwide publicity about this action and the settlements. Stories about the litigation and the 
settlements have appeared in the Asian and European editions of The Wall Street Journal and in the International Herald 
Tribune. A story that ban in the national edition of USA Today on July 2, 1992, outlining the claims process, ran in full in all 
international editions of USA Today on July 3, 1992. The international editions of USA Today have an estimated total circulation 
of over 63,000 in 33 countries. In addition, Reuters and Reuters Business Reports which disseminates news items to more than 
28,000 subscribers in 136 countries ran a news release describing various aspects of the litigation and containing a post office 
box number where individuals could write for notices and claims forms. "
1439,50," The Settlement Administration Committee recently agreed to run in a limited number of English-speaking publications, 
information concerning the approval of the settlement and the claims filing process. Objectors Bauder, et al., have withdrawn 
their pending objections. See Withdrawal of Objections, filed March 11, 1993."
1439,51," Like most objectors, Travel Analyst also objected in its written submission to the prohibition on travel agent redemption, which 
was subsequently waived by the parties."
1439,52," Travel Analysts also summarily objected to the allocation between the base and supplemental fund. With regard to this 
objection by Travel Analyst, the Court adopts its findings supra in response to the Armstrong objections."

1441,54," American Family Life Insurance Company of Columbus also appeared at the hearing and expressly adopted the objections of 
NBTA."
1441,55," The Coalition also objected to the original limitation on travel agent redemption which was subsequently abandoned. The 
Coalition urged that the settlement was unfair because the largest portion of the fund would be financed by the travel agent 
professionals rather than by the defendant airlines. "
1442,56," In fact, the Coalition states that ""the actual certificates to be issued against airline antitrust claims will have a face value (yet 
unknown) that will indeed be worth the value printed on the certificate."" Letter of Jon R. Bropst, Chairman, dated December 4,

1443,59," Armstrong proposes the following subclass definition: All United States corporations, with airline travel expenditures in an amount to be determined, who, during the period of 
January 1, 1988 to the present, purchased domestic airline passenger tickets from one or more of the defendant airlines for 
air transportation to or from a defendant's hub (as defined in Plaintiffs' Amended Consolidated Complaint), or on a single 
airline connecting at a defendant's hub, (but excluding all governmental entities and defendants, their parents, subsidiaries 
and affiliates and the directors, officers, employees of defendants, their parents, subsidiaries and affiliates). In reply to Armstrong's request for subclass certification, National Business Travel Association requests that, should Armstrong's 
motion be granted, the definition of the subclass be expanded expressly to include: ""All United States corporations, partnerships, 
associations, and other business entities, with air travel expenditures of an amount to be determined."" Reply of NBTA to Motion 
for Subclass Certification filed October 13, 1992. Other objectors join in Armstrong's request for subclass designation of all Long 
Claim Form C claimants."
1443,60," Armstrong, however, expressly supports the amount of the settlement and the distribution of discounts to class members. 
Transcript at 223."
1443,61," Armstrong also objected to the earlier prohibition on redemption through travel agents. As Armstrong concedes, however, this 
concern has been eliminated by defendants' waiver of the provision. In addition, Armstrong has raised certain other objections to 
the agreement, claiming that the proof requirements of Claim Form C are burdensome, that the travel certificates should apply to 
one-way fares, and that a danger of duplicate recovery exists for individuals who have been reimbursed for purchases by their 
employees. Armstrong does not, however, assert that any of these objections warrants subclass certification."
1443,62," Under the settlement agreement, the $ 408 million in certificates, less the $ 11.5 million in Northwest certificates, is divided 
into two funds: the base fund of $ 268,984,000, which will be distributed on a per capita basis up to $ 100 per claimant, and the 
supplemental fund of $ 127,516,000, to be distributed on a pro rata basis to Form B and C claimants. All claimants to the 
supplemental fund will also receive a distribution from the base fund. In addition, should there be fewer that 2,689,840 approved 
base fund claims, the certificates remaining will spill over into the supplemental fund. HN36[

Person Residents of the State of Oregon (the ""Oregon Objection""); Statement of Objections to Proposed Settlements by the Port 
Authority of New York and New Jersey, August 28, 1992. "
1446,64," The Attorneys General argued that the certificates should be cross-redeemable on non-defendants' airlines. This concern was 
resolved at the Fairness Hearing when Alaska Airlines announced that it had reached an agreement with the parties that other 
airlines may agree to redeem certificates. In addition, the certificates to be issued shall indicate in the legend that ""Alaska 
Airlines has agreed to redeem these certificates. Other airlines may agree to redeem these certificates. Check with your travel 
agency or your preferred air carrier."" Transcript at 165."
1446,65," In any event, there is no requirement that notice reach 100% of the class, rather, the parties need give only the best notice 
practicable under the circumstances of each case. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2). "
1447,66," The amended complaints also contained counts charging the violation of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business 
Practices Act, and common law fraud and deceit. "
1448,67," For example, Delta's answer in the Chicago litigation, which was filed on April 16, 1992, included the following affirmative 
defense: Insofar as the alleged class sought to be certified by plaintiff includes claims for damages based on airlines tickets for travel 
on Delta and other airlines purchased after December 31, 1987, the claims of the plaintiffs are the subject of a prior pending 
action in on-going multi-district proceedings in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta 
Division. Defendants' Supplemental Brief in Response to Objections of Chicago Plaintiffs, filed October 16, 1992, Exhibit D - Answer of 
Defendant Delta Airlines to Amended Class Action Complaint, Eleventh Defense, p. 18."
1448,68," Rule 10 of The Panel's Rules of Procedure requires counsel in actions transferred to notify the Clerk of the Panel of any 
potential tag-along actions in which that party is also named or in which counsel appears. ""Any parties in actions previously 
transferred under section 1407 or under consideration by the Panel for transfer under Section 1407 shall notify the Clerk of the 
Panel of any potential ""tag-along actions"" in which the party is also named. Rules of Procedure, J.P.M.L. 10(e). The rules define 
""tag-along actions"" as a civil action pending in any district court that involves common questions of fact with the transferred 
action. "
1449,69, Many of the defendants are represented by the same counsel in the Chicago litigation as in this litigation.
1449,70," The release language of the Settlement Agreement here does not encompass the Chicago claims under the Illinois Consumer 
Fraud Act and certainly not the Chicago state law claims for fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. Even if the Chicago cases do 
articulate antitrust claims encompassed within the release in this case, the state law claims in Chicago for fraud and 
misrepresentation, upon which that case was originally brought, would nonetheless remain, and the plaintiffs are not deprived of 
relief and therefore prejudiced by these settlements. "
1451,71," There are four major exceptions to the no-fee rule: (1) common fund; (2) substantial benefits conferred; (3) statutory 
authorization; and (4) sanctionable behavior. Herbert B. Newberg, Attorney Fee Awards § 1.01 (1986)."
1451,72," There has long been a debate over the appropriate method of calculating a common fund fee award. In the first Supreme 
Court case recognizing counsels' claim to fees payable out of a common fund created by their efforts, the fee award was based 
on a percentage of the fund recovered for the class. Central R.R. & Banking Co. v. Pettus, 113 U.S. 116, 127-28, 28 L. Ed. 915, 
5 S. Ct. 387 (1885). Thereafter, from 1885 to 1973, common fund fee awards were left to the court's discretion, with the only 
standard being what was reasonable under the particular circumstances of the case. Camden I, 946 F.2d at 771. In 1973, in 
order to provide reviewable findings and to insure that attorneys would be compensated for the reasonable value of their time, 
the Third Circuit established a prescribed set of guidelines that courts in that circuit must consider in determining a common fund 
fee award. Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Corp., 487 F.2d 161 (3d. Cir. 1973). Under the 
Lindy ""lodestar"" approach, the district court must first determine the number of hours reasonably spent on the matter and then "
1452,," multiply the hours by a rate that the court finds reasonable for similarly complex, non-contingent work. The lodestar figure may 
then be adjusted upward or downward for certain multiplier factors, such as contingency and quality of work performed.  Id. at 
166-68. At approximately the same time as the Lindy decision was rendered, the Fifth Circuit in Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, 
Inc., 488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 1974), adopted HN41[
] a twelve-factor method for determining court-awarded attorneys fees. The 
twelve Johnson factors are: (1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved; (3) the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly; (4) the preclusion of other employment by the attorney due to the acceptance of the case; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances; (8) the amount involved and the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10) the ""undesirability"" of the case; (11) the nature and the length of the professional relationship with the client; (12) awards in similar cases. Id. at 717-19. Although Johnson was a statutory fee award case, it has been considered outside the realm of statutory fees. See 
e.g., Hoffert v. General Motors Corp., 656 F.2d 161 (5th Cir. Unit A 1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 961 (1982). The Eleventh 
Circuit recently noted that the Lindy lodestar approach subsumes several of the Johnson factors and has refined its analysis for 
determining statutory fee awards in favor of the lodestar approach. Norman v. Housing Auth. of Montgomery, 836 F.2d 1292, 
1299 (11th Cir. 1988). In Camden I, the 11th Circuit clarified that regardless of the approaches provided in Lindy and Johnson, 
HN42[
] the lodestar and twelve-factor methods are inappropriate as a basis for computing common fund awards. 946 F.2d at"
1452,773," . Instead, the ""analysis in common fund cases focuses not on the plaintiffs' position as 'prevailing parties,' but on a showing 
that the fund conferring a benefit on the class resulted from their efforts. In this context, monetary results achieved predominate 
over all other criteria."" Id. at 774. The lodestar and Johnson factors remain useful in common fund cases only to the extent that 
they impact on the appropriate percentage to be awarded in a particular case. Id. at 775. "
1453,73," To facilitate the efficient progression of the action the Court appointed a 13-member plaintiffs' Steering Committee early in the 
litigation to execute the orders of the Court and to coordinate the initiation and conduct of discovery. In addition, the Court 
designated four of the Steering Committee members to serve as co-lead counsel responsible for the day-to-day supervision of 
the litigation. Finally, a liaison counsel was appointed as spokesperson for the plaintiffs. Pretrial Order No. 2, dated December 
21, 1990."

($ 183.8 million class recovery, 4.1% fees awarded out of 5% requested)."
1454,77," The fees award alone amounts to 4.71% of the median value of the common fund. The Court has chosen to include in its 
percentage award, however, an award of expenses accrued by counsel. See Morganstein v. Esber, 768 F. Supp. 725 (C.D. Cal. 
1991)."
1454,78," The award for fees and expenses amounts to between 4.5% and 6.3% of the entire range of approximate value of the 
settlement. Even using objector Hudders' unsubstantiated, conservative estimate of a 25% redemption rate, the award amounts 
to only 10.5% of the common fund, well below the 20-30% benchmark cited in Camden I. "
1455,79," See e.g., Response of Public Citizen, Ralph Nader, and Center for Study of Responsive Law to Joint Application of Class 
Counsel for an Award of Attorneys's Fees, Reimbursement of Expenses, and Award to Class Plaintiffs, filed September 15, 
1992; Objection of Jane Simon, Inc. to Application for Attorneys Fees of Plaintiffs' Counsel, filed November 20, 1992. Only a few 
objectors filed formal objections to the attorneys' fees application and even fewer attended the hearing held on the application. 
Six objectors argued against the application for fees at the November 30, 1992, hearing on attorneys' fees. "
1456,80," As noted earlier, the class size in this action is estimated to be between 12 and 50 million. The number of claims filed is 
approaching 3 million and the recent extension of the claims filing date to June 1, 1993, is sure to increase the number of filed 
claims."
1456,81," Class members claiming the purchase of up to 5 round trip tickets, Form A claimants, will receive certificates with a face value 
of up to $ 100 and an economic value of at least $ 50."
1456,82," When states have litigated class actions and negotiated settlements involving coupons, they have chosen to accept cash 
rather than coupons. For example, in New York v. Nintendo of Am., 775 F. Supp. 676 (S.D.N.Y. 1991), a recent settlement 
involving many of the states that have objected to the fee petition here, the settlement agreement called for purchasers of 
Nintendo products to receive coupons for $ 5 off the future purchase of Nintendo video game cartridges. Nintendo, 775 F. Supp. 
at 679. The state attorneys general, by contrast, received two cash payments under the settlement: $ 3 million for certain of the 
state purposes such as ""antitrust enforcement"" and $ 1.75 million for administrative costs, including the cost of notice and 
attorney fees. Id. The states did not receive any of their payments in the form of coupons. In addition, in the settlement of their 
claims in a recent fraud case, California and other states negotiated the award of $ 50 million in coupons to consumers who 
purchased certain auto repair services and the state received $ 3.5 million to cover the cost of its investigation and $ 1.5 million 
to finance auto repair training programs at California community colleges. Baporia v. Sears, Roebuck & Company, C-92-2341-
RHS, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California."
1456,83," See e.g., Objector Hudders' Comments on Plaintiffs' Counsel's Fee Request filed November 24, 1992; Objection of Public 
Citizen filed September 15, 1992. Many of these objections, however, were advanced prior to the elimination of the travel agent 
restriction from the settlement agreement. "
1457,84," See e.g., Objection By General Motors, a Member of the Class, to Counsel Application for Attorneys' Fees, filed September 
15, 1992; Supplemental Objections of Sandra Norris, et al. to Plaintiff Class Counsel's Joint Request for Award of Attorneys' 
Fees and Reimbursement of Expenses, filed November 17, 1992."
1457,85," At the Court's request, plaintiffs submitted a Statement of Work Assignments outlining the principal work assignments made 
to particular firms. Statement of Work Assignments, filed January 12, 1993. Immediately following their appointment by the 
Court, the co-chairs of the Steering Committee and liaison counsel assigned overall responsibility for broad general areas 
among themselves. Assignments of discrete tasks were then made to various firms. After review of the statement, the Court is 
impressed with the organization and thoroughness of the work assignment plan. There is no indication of the possibility of 
unnecessary or duplicative work. Instead, plaintiffs set up a system to streamline all of the work necessary for the successful 
pursuit of the litigation."
1457,86, Class counsel expended enormous efforts particularly to litigate the following problem areas: (1) Class certification raised novel issues concerning impact and notice; 
1458,," (2) Counsel reviewed more than 1.6 million pages of discovery and participated in approximately 100 depositions, including 
employees of defendants from the most junior analyst to senior management; (3) Class damage analysis was complicated because of the number of airline hubs involved and the difficulty of identifying a 
benchmark for damage analysis where data was available for the appropriate time periods; and (4) Settlement negotiations complicated by the financial position of the industry and the different positions of each 
defendant. "
1461,87," Fee applications have been filed on behalf of Armstrong World Industries, Inc; LeeAnn Bauder, et al.; Marilyn and Dorian 
Berger; Coalition for Concerned Travelers; Leon Cooper; Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union; 
Andrew Hudders, et al.; Management Travel Consultants, Inc; Public Citizen, et al.; Jane Simon, Inc.; Travel Analysts; and the 
Government of the Virgin Islands, et al. "
1462,88," MTC argues that its efforts to eliminate the restriction on redemption of certificates through travel agents warrants an award of 
a reasonable percentage of the common fund. MTC, however, was one among thousands of objectors who argued that the 
settlement should not be approved with the travel agent restriction. MTC extensively briefed the issue arguing that the prohibition 
amounted to an antitrust violation and submitted expert affidavits supporting its position. While MTC put forth substantially more 
effort than the typical objector, it was not singlehandedly responsible for the elimination of the restriction. Rather, MTC was a 
significant contributor to a large chorus of objectors. The objector should not be awarded disproportionate compensation for its 
efforts."
1462,89," In calculating the lodestar, the Court excluded any charges included in the affidavits for preparation of the fee application. 
Also, the hourly rates charged by the applicants ranged from $ 180 to $ 280 with the exception of MTC whose counsel charged 
up to $ 450 per hour. The Court finds the hourly rates charged by MTC excessive for the work performed during the limited 
objection period. Accordingly, in calculating MTC's fee award, the Court has capped the hourly rate charged by MTC at $ 300."
1462,90," The combined percentage award to class counsel and objectors' counsel equals 5.52%, well below the 20-30% threshold 
established by the 11th Circuit in Camden I. "
1463,91," Objector Cooper also moved for sanctions against plaintiffs and defendants for failure to provide copies of the complaint and 
other filed documents. The parties are not required to provide class members with items that are a matter of public record and 
available for a fee from the Clerk of Court. Cooper also moved for advance certification of this matter for appeal should the Court 
approve the settlement. The Court may certify this matter for appeal only after entry of a final judgment or, should objector so 
move, after a finding that an interlocutory appeal is proper. Accordingly, the Court will deny objector Cooper's motions for 
sanctions and for certification of appeal. "
1476,1," After denying Cellular Plus's motion for reconsideration of the court's rulings sustaining the demurrers to these two causes of 
action, the court then granted the defendants' motion to strike the individual plaintiffs from all remaining causes of action. "
1477,2," The Cartwright Act is California's version of the federal Sherman Act and sets forth California's antitrust laws, including price 
fixing prohibitions.  The Cartwright Act is found at Business and Professions Code section 16700 et seq. "
1478,3, All statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code unless otherwise specified. 
1479,4," We further note there is no danger of duplicate recovery by recognizing claims by both consumers who paid too much for 
cellular service and sales agents who lost sales.  This is because price fixing resulting in artificially high prices can cause two 
separate types of injuries.  As to actual sales made to consumers, the injury to such consumers is the excessive portion of the 
price they actually paid for the service.  As to sales agents, however, their injuries result from the logical effect that excessive 
prices have on customers or potential customers. When prices are too high, a certain portion of the potential market is ""priced 
out of the market,"" resulting in artificially reduced total sales.  Thus, the sales agents are precluded from obtaining sales that 
otherwise would have been made had it not been for the price fixing agreement. "

1491,2," Although Martlet has been identified in the style of the case, the Court has been unable to locate any reference to Martlet in 
the body of plaintiffs' complaint. "
1492,3," Although the parties disagree as to the relevant market applicable, the Court is of the opinion that a finding as to the relevant 
market is not essential to a determination of plaintiffs' likelihood of success on the merits."

1513,35," Contrary to the assertions in National's Response, the court in Berkley distinguishes between patents which are obtained 
through fraud and patents which are obtained through inequitable conduct. The court states: A patent procured by fraud by definition would not have issued but for the misrepresentation or non-disclosure. The patent 
is invalid as improperly issued and the patentee has illegally received exclusionary rights he would not otherwise have. In 
those circumstances, . . . the sanctions of the Sherman Act may be warranted. However, where the patent was not procured through non-disclosure, the patent would properly issue and the patentee 
would receive no exclusionary rights to which he was not legally entitled under the patent laws. Hence, no basis exists for a 
charge of illegal monopolization or attempt to monopolize. Berkley, 620 F.2d at 1274 (emphasis added). "

1519,2," The most significant changes in the Nature of Trade and Commerce section appears in paragraphs 14 and 16. Paragraph 14 
deletes three sentences describing how COMSAT influenced the actions of INTELSAT and replaces them with the following 
sentence: The dominant ownership position of COMSAT in INTELSAT and COMSAT's historical dominance over INTELSAT's 
operations have enhanced the credibility, and thereby the resulting damage and injury to PAS, of representations made by 
COMSAT to actual and prospective customers of PAS concerning the inability of PAS to obtain necessary INTELSAT and 
other approvals, agreements, and prerequisites to effective operation, as set forth more fully in paragraph 28 hereinbelow. Second Amended Complaint P 14. Paragraph 16 omits INTELSAT's 1990 plans to launch several satellites and adds these two sentences: COMSAT is the sole and exclusive marketer of INTELSAT satellite services and capacity in the United States. Prior to the 
creation of PAS as set forth hereafter, COMSAT, by reason of its position as the only purveyor of INTELSAT satellite 
services and capacity, possessed a total 100% monopoly in the marketing of telecommunications satellite services and

1528,2," In his Response to this motion, Cleveland attempts in at least three places to supplement his arguments with evidence not in

1532,4," Local 150 apparently chose not to respond to plaintiffs' motion. In their memorandum in support of their motion, however, 
plaintiffs note that the affirmative defenses raised by the Consolidated Defendants are identical to those raised by Local 150. 
The following analysis, therefore, applies equally to all defendants. "
1539,1," During trial and in previous decisions, the court has referred to the plaintiff as ""Sears."" In this Opinion, the court will continue 
that practice."
1539,2," The general purpose charge card market was defined at trial as consisting of any charge card which could be used for general 
purposes at a wide variety of retail establishments. Gasoline charge cards, department store charge cards, and other charge 
cards accepted only at limited locations were not considered to be general purpose charge cards. At the time Sears began its 
investigation there were five general purpose charge cards distributed nationwide: Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Diners 
club, and Carte Blanche. "
1540,3," Proprietary cards were defined at trial as charge cards owned and distributed solely by a single business entity. At the time 
Sears entered the general purpose charge card market with the Discover Card in 1985, the only other issuers of proprietary 
general purpose charge cards were American Express and Citibank (Diners Club/Carte Blanche)."
1540,4," Eventually Visa and Sears resolved their disputes regarding the use of terminals, allowing merchants to use the same 
terminals for both cards."
1540,5," The evidence at trial indicated that the Discover Card is one of the most effective competitors in the general purpose charge 
card market. The Discover Card has surpassed its business projections in every year of its existence, earning $ 80 million in net 
income in 1989, $ 117 million in 1990, and $ 170 million in 1991. (Def.'s Ex. 571). Discover Card has been referred to as ""one of 
the two or three most remarkable success stories in American business in the late 1980s[.]"" (Tr. at 256). "
1541,6," Sears attempted to gain entry into Visa without clearly disclosing to Visa its affiliation with MountainWest Financial. Aware of 
Bylaw 2.06, MountainWest Financial failed to reveal to Visa its affiliation with Sears and the Discover Card. Visa discovered that 
MountainWest Financial was actually owned by Sears only after conducting its own investigation. Visa has pending against 
Sears a counterclaim for fraud. "
1542,7," A 12-person jury was initially selected. One of the jurors, however, failed to appear on the first day of trial following jury 
selection and before the presentation of opening statements. The court proceeded with 11 jurors, with the agreement of counsel 
for both parties, and in accordance with Rule 48 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure."
1542,8," Evidence at trial showed that in 1991 the ten largest issuers of Visa and MasterCard accounted for approximately 43% of the 
total Visa/MasterCard charge volume. The top-ten issuers were Citicorp, First Chicago, AT&T, Chase Manhattan, MBNA 
America, Bank of America, Nationsbank, Chemical Bank, Banc One, and Wells Fargo Bank. The largest issuer, Citicorp, 
accounted for approximately $ 42.5 billion in charge volume in 1991-- representing approximately 15.8% of the Visa/MasterCard 
market and 11.4% of the entire general purpose charge card market. "
1544,9," Visa first raised the argument in support of its Motion for Summary Judgment. The court denied the motion in a written opinion. 
SCFC ILC, Inc. v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 801 F. Supp. 517, 523 (D. Utah 1992). Thereafter, the issue was raised again in connection 
with Visa's Motion for Certification for Interlocutory Appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), which the court denied. The argument 
was again presented at the close of Sears' case at trial as Visa's Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law under Rule 50(a) of 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Finally, Visa raises the issue in support of this Rule 50(b) Motion for Judgment as a Matter 
of Law."
1544,10," Sears' claim is actually one for damages under Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15. Although Section 1 of the 
Sherman Act provides for criminal penalties, Section 4 of the Clayton Act allows for private enforcement of the antitrust laws by 
private parties. Section 4 provides in relevant part: . . . any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may

agent . . . ."
1544,15, U.S.C.A. § 15 (Supp. 1992). 
1545,11," Joint ventures often fall into this category. See North Am. Soccer League v. National Football League, 670 F.2d 1249, 1259 
(2d Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1074, 74 L. Ed. 2d 639, 103 S. Ct. 499 (1982) (""Because agreements between members of a 
joint venture can under some circumstances have legitimate purposes as well as anticompetitive effects, they are subject to 
scrutiny under the rules of reason.""); NCAA, 468 U.S. at 100-01 (Per se analysis inappropriate in an industry in which ""horizontal 
restraints on competition are essential if the product is to be available at all.""); Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting 
Sys., 441 U.S. 1, 23, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1, 99 S. Ct. 1551 (1979) (""Joint ventures and other cooperative arrangements are also not 
usually unlawful, at least not as price-fixing schemes, where the agreement on price is necessary to market the product at all."") 
Furthermore, the per se presumption will not be used against a joint venture if the defendant lacks market power or exclusive 
access to an essential facility. See Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery & Printing Co., 472 U.S. 284, 296-
98, 86 L. Ed. 2d 202, 105 S. Ct. 2613 (1985). "
1546,12," In some circumstances, not applicable to this case detailed evidence of market power may be unnecessary. See FTC v. 
Indiana Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 460, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445, 106 S. Ct. 2009 (1986); Reazin v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 899 
F.2d 951, 968 n.24 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 497 U.S. 1005, 111 L. Ed. 2d 752, 110 S. Ct. 3241 (1990). "
1547,13," In 1991, for example, the top five Visa/MasterCard issuers controlled 36.7% of the total charge volume for the two 
associations. (Pl.'s Ex. 752). Those five issuers were Citicorp, First Chicago, AT&T Universal, Chase Manhattan, and MBNA 
America."
1547,14," The case was remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit which was then ""free to consider whether 
there is other evidence that is sufficiently unambiguous to permit a trier of fact to find that [defendants] conspired to price 
predatorily for two decades despite the absence of any apparent motive to do so."" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 597. "
1548,15," See Part I.B.2. of this Opinion, infra."
1548,16," These principles are also important to Visa's factual argument. Based upon the same economic principles, Visa argues that 
no reasonable jury could find Visa's conduct to have a substantially harmful effect upon competition. "
1549,17," It is not entirely clear the extent to which this is a proposal for a new screen or the extent to which it is based on the two 
previously-mentioned screens of market power and economic sense. In any event, the court recognizes, and Visa concedes, 
that there is no direct precedent for Visa's argument either in the case law or from the language of the Sherman Act itself. "
1550,18," Section 2 provides: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce . . . shall be deemed guilty of a felony . . . ."
1550,15, U.S.C.A. § 2 (Supp. 1992). 
1551,19," Visa cites Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984), as 
support for its argument. Visa argues: ""Applying the standard that properly governs restrictions on competition by or among 
members to a refusal to share property is, in our view, as inappropriate as treating a 'conspiracy' between a parent and its 
subsidiary as a conspiracy subject to Section 1."" Visa's Oct. 26, 1992, Memorandum in Support of Motion for Judgment Under 
Rule 50., at 10 (emphasis in original). The court finds no merit in this argument. Copperweld offers no support for Visa's position. Copperweld stands for the simple 
proposition that a parent and its subsidiary constitute a single entity for antitrust purposes. 467 U.S. at 777. As such, their 
activities are not governed by Section 1. The Court focused on the distinction between the independent activities of a single 
entity and the concerted conduct of multiple entities. It found no ""joint activity"" and therefore Section 1 was not applicable. Id. 
The holding of the case has no application whatsoever to the issue in this case regarding the application of Section 1 to joint 
venture activity, regardless of the fact that there are different types of agreements among joint venture members. "
1552,20," Associated Press is often referred to as a so-called ""essential facilities"" case. As discussed in Part I.A.4.c. of this Opinion, 
Associated Press does not involve a facility that was essential to the existence of the non-Associated Press newspapers as rival, 
on-going concerns. There is no doubt the facility in question -- membership in Associated Press -- was very important to the 
plaintiffs, but it was, strictly speaking, not essential."
1552,21," At the December 22, 1992, motion hearing, Visa pointed out that Reazin was distinguishable from the instant case, noting that 
the two would be analogous if Visa had conspired with merchants to deal only with Visa members and not with Discover. The 
court agrees that Reazin's value here is limited to showing that a Rule of Reason analysis is appropriate in Section 1 refusal to 
deal cases."
1552,22," Visa argues that Sears lacks standing to make this argument. Because Sears has apparently suffered no injury from the 
disincentive aspects of Bylaw 2.06, Visa argues that Sears is prohibited from raising this argument to the court or jury. The issue 
of Sears' standing and injury is discussed in Part I.C. of this Opinion. Sears properly argued the disincentive aspects of Bylaw 
2.06 to the court and the jury. Although standing is required to challenge a given restraint, it is not necessary to have standing as 
to each alleged harmful effect of the restraint. Sears has standing to bring this action because of its exclusion from the Visa "
1553,," system. A party with proper standing may present evidence as to all anticompetitive effects of the challenged restraint, whether 
or not it has suffered direct antitrust injury flowing from each effect. The question is actually one of admissibility of the evidence, 
not one of standing. The court found the disincentive evidence to be clearly relevant to the harmful effects issue. The court 
further found that its probative value was not outweighed by unfair prejudice or any of the other factors set forth in Rule 403 of 
the Federal Rules of Evidence."
1553,23," Although such an interpretation of Bylaw 2.06 is not apparent on its face, Visa has made it clear that the bylaw applies to 
current members as well as new applicants. Furthermore, after the amendment to Bylaw 2.06 was passed, Visa later amended 
Bylaw 2.10, to directly prohibit all current Visa members from issuing other proprietary, competitive cards. This issue is 
discussed further in this court's ruling on Sears' Motion for an Order Enforcing its Rights Under Federal Banking Law. 784 F. 
Supp. 822, 832-34 (D. Utah 1992)."
1553,24," such restrictions often trigger per se illegality presumptions. However, as discussed in Part I.A.1.b. of this Opinion, the per se 
presumption may not be proper when the restraint has the potential for legitimate, beneficial effects, or if it is necessary for the 
product to be available at all. See North American Soccer, 670 F.2d at 1259. Thus, although it could be argued that Bylaw 2.06 is subject to the per se illegality presumption, the court has found the 
presumption is not proper in this case. Visa has presented substantial evidence and argument as to the beneficial aspects of 
Bylaw 2.06. Accordingly, the reasonableness of the bylaw should be determined by the jury under the Rule of Reason. Sears has apparently conceded this point. It has not argued for a per se illegality declaration by the court. Rather, it agrees with 
the court's decision to submit the claim to the jury. "
1554,25," Section 2, of course, applies to all entities, whether acting alone or in concert. No entity, or group of entities, may act to 
monopolize or attempt to monopolize without violating Section 2. Thus, the Sherman Act makes a ""basic distinction between 
concerted and independent action."" Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 761, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775, 104 S. Ct. 
1464 (1984). "
1555,26," Applying this analysis to the present case, Visa's expert witness, Professor Richard Schmalensee, stated at trial: It makes no more economic sense to require Visa to share its property with Discover, because it is an association of 6,000 
people, than it would make to require Discover to share its property with others simply because it has been selfish in some 
sense and not shared at all. Neither kind of reasoning makes sense. (Tr. at 2275). This is a proper economic factual argument, but it does not reinvent the meaning of Section 1. Unless Discover 
possesses monopoly power, as a single business it is not required to share its property. "
1556,27," Of course, the plaintiff must establish that it has suffered antitrust injury from the restraint. This does not require, however, a 
showing of inability to compete. A showing of negative impact on the ability to compete is sufficient. "
1557,28," In the present case, Visa presented its economic arguments to the jury in considerable detail. The jury presumably 
considered all of Visa's arguments when making its determination of the unreasonableness of Bylaw 2.06. "
1558,29," At trial, Visa's expert witness, Professor Richard Schmalensee, stated he had been involved in drafting a legislative proposal 
aimed at joint ventures created for the purpose of research and development. (See Tr. at 2276-78). This proposal addressed an 
antitrust exemption to allow separate companies to pool their efforts into research and development joint ventures, thereby 
obtaining greater efficiencies, without the constant threat of being declared illegal per se. This exemption from the antitrust laws 
was sought from the legislative branch, not the judiciary. Arguments made to Congress in favor of the exemption were similar to those Visa makes here: every joint research and 
development effort by two or more firms, no matter how desirable for competition and consumers, was subject to a Section 1 
lawsuit and a possible finding of per seillegality. Competitors not involved in the joint research and development venture, 
therefore, had every incentive to file such a suit. It was asserted that this threat of litigation and per se illegality was hindering 
American progress, and was one reason America was lagging behind other countries in certain economic respects. The 
proponents of the proposed bill argued that without the threat of per se illegality, more American firms would combine money 
and talent for joint research and development projects. S. Rep. No. 427, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 1 (1984), reprinted in 1984 in 
U.S.C.C.A.N. 3105. The result of this effort was passage of the National Cooperative Research Act of 1984. 15 U.S.C.A. $ 4301 (Supp. 1983 to 
1991). It took an exemption specifically enacted by Congress to achieve the desired antitrust relief in the research and 
development area. No court has the power to grant such an antitrust exemption. "
1559,30," The evidence showed that as of the time of trial, the Discover Card had never charged less than a 19.8% annual percentage 
rate, the only general purpose charge card never to have charged a lower rate. The Sears Charge card used at Sears retail 
stores has historically charged an annual percentage rate of approximately 21%."
1559,31," Regardless of the intent and motivation of Visa's member banks in passing Bylaw 2.06, Mr. Katz, as Visa's chief legal officer, 
expressed concern about government regulation if Visa were to grow significantly larger. Mr. Katz explained that if Sears were to 
become a Visa member and as a result the Discover Card became less of a competitive force, the federal government may well 
impose more intrusive regulations on the Visa association or even require a dissolution or break-up of some kind. It is a credible 
concern for a business in our free enterprise system to worry about being run by the government, whether through the 
enactment of legislative controls, executive branch administration, or perhaps worst of all, judicial branch scrutiny and approval 
of its every move. "
1560,32," See Part I.A.2. of this Opinion, supra. "
1562,33," At the time of trial, Prime Option Visa's terms anticipated a 25-day grace period for all card holders, a 9.9% rate of interest on 
the current and the previous month' a purchases and a rate of 9.9% plus the Prime Rate on older purchases. In addition, there is 
no annual fee, a periodic skip-a-payment, and a standard opening credit line of $ 3500. "
1563,34," Sears presented credible evidence that the Discover Card has more appeal to persons who tend to promptly pay their credit 
card balances, referred to in the industry as ""transactors,"" than it has to persons who carry credit card balances from month to 
month, referred to in the industry as ""revolvers."" Visa and MasterCard are used primarily by revolvers. Prime Option Visa is 
designed to appeal to revolvers, rather than transactors, and in that sense is not expected to be in direct competition with the 
Discover Card."
1563,35," Again, the court notes that it was possible that the jury found all of Visa's arguments concerning intersystem competition 
persuasive. However, the jury may still have concluded that the harms to competition substantially outweighed the benefits. "
1564,36," It is conceivable that Sears could argue that it was affected by the disincentive aspects of Bylaw 2.06 because Sears would 
choose membership in Visa over continuing to operate the Discover Card, but Sears offered no evidence to support such an 
argument."
1564,37," The jury was instructed on the issue of injury as follows: If you determine that Visa has unreasonably restrained trade in the relevant market, you must next determine whether 
Sears was injured by Visa's actions. Proving injury does not require Sears to prove a dollar amount, but only that Sears was 
in fact injured by Visa's alleged restraint of trade. It is important to understand that injury and the amount of damages are 
different concepts. In this trial, you will not be determining the amount of damages, if any, suffered by Sears. To establish injury, Sears must have offered evidence which establishes as a matter of fact and with a fair degree of 
certainty that Visa's alleged illegal conduct was a material cause of Sears' injury. This means that Sears must have proved 
that some injury flowed to it as a result of Visa's alleged restraint of trade. If the injury would be merely incidental or 
inconsequential, or if Visa's antitrust acts would be so removed from the injury as to be only remotely causative, then Sears 
would not be injured by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws. Sears is not required to prove that Visa's alleged 
restraint of trade was the sole cause of its injury; nor need Sears eliminate all other possible causes of injury to establish 
causation. It is enough if Sears has proved that the alleged restraint of trade was a material cause of its injury. However, if "
1565,," you find that Sears' injury was caused by something other than the alleged restraint of trade, then you must find that Sears 
has failed to prove the fact of injury. Jury Instruction 24. It is assumed that the jury followed this explicit instruction and based its answer to the question regarding 
antitrust injury on a finding that Sears suffered antitrust injury as a result of Visa's antitrust violation."
1565,38," Visa argues that a new trial may be required ""since it is impossible to tell from the jury's verdict whether their respective 
determinations of illegality and fact of injury were predicated on one claim rather than the other. . . ."" Visa's Nov. 24, 1992, Mem., 
at 55 n.53. This argument was reiterated by Visa in a letter dated January 27, 1993. There, Visa submitted to the court a recently decided 
United States Supreme Court case, Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 122 L. Ed. 2d 247, 113 S. Ct. 884 (1993). Visa asserts 
that this ruling supports the proposition that ""a general jury verdict will be upheld only if there is substantial evidence to support 
each and every theory of liability submitted to the jury."" Syufy Enters. v. American Multicinema, Inc., 793 F.2d 990, 1001 (9th Cir. 
1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1031, 93 L. Ed. 2d 830, 107 S. Ct. 876 (1987). In Spectrum Sports, the jury found the defendant 
liable under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, but it was unclear whether the jury based its decision on a finding of monopolization, 
conspiracy to monopolize or attempted monopolization. Because there was insufficient factual evidence to support a finding of 
attempted monopolization and it was possible that the jury rested its decision regarding liability on that theory alone, the 
Supreme Court held that the case had to be retried. In the instant case Visa argues that because the jury verdict with respect to 
injury does not indicate what evidence was the basis of the jury's decision; the verdict must be set aside. Visa's argument and the holding of Spectrum Sports, however, have nothing to do with the present case. Here, it is not 
impossible to tell upon what evidence the jury relied in making its determination of injury. As discussed above, Sears' exclusion 
evidence was the basis for the jury's finding of antitrust injury. Likewise, this evidence was necessarily relied upon, at least in 
part, in finding the restraint to be unreasonable. Spectrum Sports stands for the simple proposition that if one theory upon which 
a verdict of liability may have been based was improperly submitted to the fact-finder, the case must be retried. That is obvious 
because the verdict may rest on an impermissible legal standard. But such a concept has no application whatsoever in this case 
in which all evidence of liability (both disincentive evidence and Sears' exclusion evidence) was properly admitted, and in which 
the jury was properly instructed that Sears' injury must flow directly from the anticompetitive restraint. In Spectrum Sports an 
improper theory was submitted to the jury. No such submission occurred here."
1565,39," The statute Provides, in pertinent part: "
1566,," No person engaged in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any 
part of the stock or other share capital and no person subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission shall 
acquire the whole or any part of the assets of another person engaged also in commerce or in any activity affecting 
commerce, where in any line of commerce or in any activity affecting commerce in any section of the country, the effect of 
such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly."
1566,15, U.S.C.A. § 18 (Supp. 1992).
1566,40," ""Line of commerce"" refers to the relevant product or services market. Philadelphia National Bank, 374 U.S. at 356. The term 
""section of the country"" applies to the relevant geographical market for the product. Id. In the instant case, the parties have 
agreed that the relevant market is the general purpose charge card market for the United States. "
1567,41," Penn-Olin involved the joint participation of two corporations in the creation of a third. In comparing such a joint venture to a 
merger, the Court stated: The joint venture, like the ""merger"" and the ""conglomeration,"" often creates anticompetitive dangers. It is the chosen 
competitive instrument of two or more corporations previously acting independently and usually competitively with one 
another. The result is ""a triumvirate of associated corporations."" If the parent companies are in competition, or might 
compete absent the joint venture, it may be assumed that neither will compete with the progeny in its line of commerce. 
Inevitably, the operations of the joint venture will be frozen to those lines of commerce which will not bring it into 
competition with the parents, and the latter, by the same token will be foreclosed from the joint venture's market. Penn-Olin, 378 U.S. at 169 (footnote omitted)."
1567,42," The court rejects Sears' assertion that the Clayton Act counterclaim requires an analysis based on a ""vertical"" merger. If the 
""merger"" here were vertical, Sears would not have been allowed to bring an action under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. 
Furthermore, what must be examined is the effect on competition if the same parent organization, Sears, were to issue Prime 
Option Visa and Discover, two competing charge cards. If the ""merger"" were to occur, Prime Option Visa and Discover would be 
offering comparable goods, i.e., general purpose charge cards. "
1568,43," This figure of 3231 is obtained by squaring the market shares of each system issuer and then adding the total: 45.6<2> + 
26.4<2> + 5.5<2> + 20.5<2> + 2.0<2> = 3231."
1568,44," This figure of 3732 is obtained by adding Discover's market share of 5.5% with Visa's share of 45.6% for a total of 51.1%. 
That figure is then squared and added to the squares for the other systems: 51.1<2> + 26.4<2> + 20.5<2> + 2.0<2> = 3732."
1568,45," Visa points out that under Dr. Kearl's view of the general purpose charge card market, the market shares of Visa and 
MasterCard should be combined, yielding a total market share of 72%. Using this figure, Visa asserts that the market would then "
1569,," have a pre-""merger"" HHI of 5639, and a post-""merger"" total of 6431. This change in the HHI would make out a prima facie case 
of a Section 7 violation."
1569,46," In making this assertion, the court does not claim that the Visa association lacks market power. Rather, the court believes that 
the HHI analysis deals strictly with the concept of market shares, and is most helpful in assessing the possible impact on 
competition when companies combine their market shares through merger or the creation of joint ventures. The court finds, 
however, that the HHI is not particularly helpful in assessing the impact on competition under the facts of this case."
1569,47," The court recognizes that Visa and Discover will not remain entirely independent. Sears, the owner of Discover, will 
presumably control a share of the Visa system through Prime Option. However, Sears would be only one of approximately 6000 
Visa issuers. Even if Sears were to meet its stated goal of becoming one of the five largest Visa issuers, (see Tr. at 187; Def.'s 
Ex. 72, at S112131), its market share of the Visa system would be less than 10%. This would not constitute a complete merger 
of the two entities. At best, it could be called a partial or hybrid merger. Under such circumstances, the court finds that the HHI 
analysis is not particularly useful in determining the probability of anticompetitive effects. "
1571,48," The court notes that competition between Visa and MasterCard decreased following duality. The court believes that one 
significant reason for this change was due to the fact that Visa and MasterCard are nearly identical products, appealing to the 
same consumer needs."
1571,49," Although the court must assess probabilities which might result from Sears' entry into the Visa system, it is difficult to properly 
assess whether American Express will follow Sears' lead and seek Visa membership. American Express issues the Optima 
""revolver"" card and the ""transactional"" green card, but the court does not have facts before it concerning the type of consumer 
targeted by the Optima card. As a result, the court declines to conclude that American Express would also enter the Visa 
system, causing a lessening of competitive vigor of the Optima card. "
1572,50," See Pl.'s Ex. 297, at 70201150. The parent organizations of these 21 Visa members include such prominent companies as 
the Ford Motor Company, Merrill Lynch, Kemper Insurance, ITT, J.C. Penney, and Aetna Life & Casualty Co. Id."
1572,51," The court's factual attitudes toward Sears' Sherman Act claim and Visa's Clayton Act counterclaim are identical. In both 
situations, the court sees the entry of Sears into Visa as slightly more harmful than helpful to competition, although not 
substantially more harmful. If before this litigation was ever commenced, the trial judge had been given the authority to tell Visa 
what it could or could not do under the antitrust laws, and Visa had then inquired whether it could keep Sears out of Visa, the 
answer would have been ""yes."" Conversely, if Visa had asked whether it could let Sears in the association, the answer would 
have also been ""yes."" Unfortunately for Visa, only the latter question was directed to the court while the former went to the jury, 
which said ""no."""
1572,52," Sears argues that the court is precluded from rendering a verdict in favor of Visa on the Clayton Act counterclaim unless the 
court also grants Visa's motion for judgment as a matter of law. Sears bases this assertion on the doctrine of collateral estoppel 
or issue preclusion. It appears to the court that the better reasoning is that despite the jury's verdict, the court is not precluded from deciding the 
Clayton Act claim. See Milonas v. Williams, 691 F.2d 931, 935 (10th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1069 (1983) (trial judge 
entered permanent injunction against defendants despite jury's prior verdict in favor of defendants on damages issue). The court 
is not persuaded that collateral estoppel is applicable because of the different standards applied to the two causes of action at 
issue. Determination of the collateral estoppel issue, however, is not necessary here as the court does not find sufficient 
evidence to sustain a Clayton Act violation. "
1573,53," The entire text of Instruction 20 reads as follows: During the trial you have heard evidence about certain business activities and decisions by both Sears and Visa. For 
example, you have heard evidence that Sears has refused to accept Visa cards in its department stores and that Visa has 
refused to let Sears issue a Visa card while permitting one of its members to issue Diners Club and Carte Blanche cards. 
You have also heard evidence about certain activities Visa undertook or encouraged its members to undertake after the 
Discover card was launched in early 1986 for the purpose of impeding Discover's success. With regard to these various activities and decisions by Sears and Visa, I instruct you that there is no contention or 
allegation in this case that any of these activities was unlawful. It is permissible for firms to choose how and with whom they 
will do business as long as such activity does not violate the antitrust laws. The antitrust laws do not necessarily require 
businesses to deal with similar firms in a similar manner. This evidence was admitted so that you might understand the 
workings of the marketplace and the intent of the parties, in order to help you decide what effect the passage and 
enforcement of the amendment to Bylaw 2.06 has on competition in the relevant market. You should give this evidence "
1574,," such weight, if any, that you believe it deserves in considering the actual antitrust claim made by Sears in this case 
regarding the competitive effect of Visa Bylaw 2.06. Additionally, you have heard evidence concerning the fairness of certain activities undertaken by both parties. You are to 
consider such evidence only as it relates to or helps you understand the effect of the amendment to bylaw 2.06 on 
competition in the relevant market."
1574,54," The entire text of Visa's Proposed Instruction 101 reads as follows: During the trial you have heard evidence about certain activities that VISA undertook or encouraged its members to take 
after the Discover card was launched in early 1986 for the purpose of impeding or preventing Discover's success. You have 
further heard testimony concerning what effect, if any, those activities had on the success of Discover. That evidence was admitted so that you might understand the workings of the marketplace including, in particular, the 
relations between the parties to this case. However, I instruct you that there is no contention or allegation in this case that 
such activities by VISA or its members were wrongful or that they violated the antitrust laws. As I have previously instructed "
1575,," you, it is the purpose of the antitrust laws to encourage vigorous competition. Accordingly, you should give evidence 
concerning VISA's activities in response to the introduction of the Discover card such weight, if any, that you believe it 
deserves in considering the actual antitrust claims made by Sears in this case, about which I previously have instructed 
you. However, you may not base any finding in this case upon a determination that the anti-Discover campaign was itself 
unlawful or anti-competitive."
1575,55," Visa submitted two versions of its Proposed Instruction 102. Version A reads as follows: You have heard evidence in this case about the fact that VISA has permitted others to become members of VISA since By-
Law 2.06 was enacted and that it permits its members to issue other general purpose cards, such as MasterCard, Diners 
Club and Carte Blanche. The only issue before you is whether VISA By-Law 2.06 has unreasonably restrained competition in the market for general 
purpose charge cards in the United States. As to that issue, I instruct you that evidence concerning the issuance of other 
cards or the admission of other new members does not tend to prove that By-Law 2.06 is anti-competitive. The antitrust 
laws do not require businesses to deal with like firms in a like manner. This evidence was admitted solely to provide you 
with a full factual understanding of market facts which might be pertinent to the relations of the parties. Visa's proposed Version B reads: You have heard evidence on this case about the fact that VISA has permitted other firms to become members of VISA 
since By-Law 2.06 was enacted and that it permits its members to issue other general purpose cards, such as MasterCard, 
Diners Club and Carte Blanche. The parties have submitted conflicting evidence on the nature and extent of the competition from such other card programs 
or systems and it is for you to resolve such conflicts. However, I instruct you that the antitrust laws do not require VISA to 
deal on the same or equal basis with other parties, be they members or non-members. Unless the effect of VISA By-Law 
2.06 is to unreasonably restrain competition in the relevant market, a business such as VISA is free to determine for itself 
the parties with whom it will do business or share its property and it does not violate the antitrust laws for it to do business 
or share property with certain firms while refusing to do so with others, even others that are similarly situated. Evidence concerning VISA's treatment of other firms has been admitted for the sole purpose of permitting you to 
understand the facts relevant to the market for general purpose credit cards and to help you evaluate VISA's purpose in 
enacting By-Law 2.06 in accordance with my prior instructions to you regarding intent. As the sole judges of the facts, you 
should resolve any conflicts in the evidence on this subject as you deem appropriate and should give this evidence such 
weight, if any, as you believe it is entitled on the issues I have mentioned. However, I instruct you that no finding of anti-
competitive effect may be based upon the fact that VISA did not treat Sears and its affiliates in the same manner as it 
treated other businesses, whether or not you consider the reasons for such treatment to be fair."
1575,56," The entire text of Visa's Proposed Instruction 103 reads as follows: Sears has introduced evidence that in 1983 it adopted a multi-card strategy, that it did so in reliance upon VISA's 
membership rules as they then existed and that if Sears had known that VISA would thereafter change its membership 
rules Sears might have made different business decisions with respect to how it chose to enter the general purpose charge 
card market. VISA has offered contrary evidence on these issues. This evidence was admitted solely for the purpose of permitting you to understand the history of the relationship between 
the parties. I now instruct you that no claim of anticompetitive effect may be based on this evidence. There is no claim in 
this case, nor can there be, that VISA has violated the anti-trust laws by interfering with Sears' alleged multi-card strategy. "
1581,1," The second count of the indictment charged the defendant Giannattasio with perjury.  On July 10, 1990, a jury found him not 
guilty of the charge."
1581,2," The Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 USC § 1, reads, ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in 
restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal"". "
1590,1," This ruling applies only to defendants Angelo Squillante and Admiral Trucking, as this matter has been reported settled as to 
all other defendants. "
1591,2," Since defendants do not provide a separate and distinct analysis under the Connecticut Constitution, only the claim that the 
Fifth Amendment bars this suit will be considered."
1591,3," However, this quote is not dispositive since it can be interpreted as referring only to instances where the defendant has not 
been punished or prosecuted. "
1596,1," ""Defendants"" include AT&T, the NYNEX corporation, Ameritech Corporation, Bell Atlantic Corporation, Bell Communications 
Research Incorporated, BellSouth Corporation, Cincinnati Bell Telephone Company, Pacific Telesis Group, Southwestern Bell 
Corporation, the Southern New England Telephone Company and U.S. West Incorporated, as well as other entities related to 
these companies. "
1597,2," Plaintiffs concede that the ""annual base pay rate"" of an employee who works for only a portion of a full year will be adjusted as 
if the employee worked for one full year. Thus, plaintiffs acknowledge that a part-time employee who works for only six months 
out of a year and earns $ 35,000 would have an ""annual base pay rate"" of $ 70,000 and he or she would not be entitled to 
portability. (Plaintiffs' Memorandum at 2). This dispute also does not involve part-time employees who do not work enough hours to entitle them to service credits under 
ERISA. Rather, this dispute involves only those employees who have worked for at least a full year and thus qualify for service 
credits, but who do not work enough hours per week to be considered full-time employees. "
1603,1," Rule 2.41(f) provides in pertinent part: All applications for approval of proposed … acquisitions … subject to Commission review under outstanding orders … will 
be placed on the public record as soon after they are received…. Within thirty (30) days after such requests … are placed 
on the public record, any person may file formal written objections or comments with the Secretary of the Commission. 
Such objections or comments shall be placed on the public record…. All responses to applications for approval … together 
with a statement of supporting reasons, will be published when made. "
1608,*," Judge John R. Brown was on the panel that heard oral argument in this case, but passed away before the decision was 
entered, and the case is accordingly decided by a quorum. See 28 U.S.C. § 46(d). "
1609,1," Matrix also sought relief for common law trademark infringement and unfair competition, among other claims. These were 
dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) and Matrix does not challenge or appeal the dismissal of these claims. "
1611,2," Nor do we consider Polymer Technology Corp. v. Mimran, 975 F.2d 58 (2d Cir.1992), recently cited to us by Matrix, as 
persuasive authority for a contrary result here. There two distinct lines of contact lens care products were involved. One line was 
packaged for retail sale, and contained Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required consumer labeling, warnings, and tamper-
evident seals. The other line was distributed to professionals such as ophthalmologists and optometrists; the FDA regulations 
did not apply to this line and its packaging had not been submitted to the FDA for approval; it was frequently distributed in bulk, 
with individual items not having the labeling or warnings, and sometimes not the tamper-evident seals, required by the FDA for 
items sold at retail. Id. at 60-61. The manufacturer and trademark owner, Polymer, claimed that the defendant sold professional 
kits at retail, and also broke them down and sold separately at retail the individual bottles of professional solutions. The district 
court denied a temporary injunction. On appeal, a divided Second Circuit panel remanded for reconsideration because the 
district court had apparently not considered evidence that the defendant broke the packaging on the professional kits and sold 
the individual items separately at retail. The majority noted Polymer's claim ""that distribution of professional solutions in the retail 
market subjects it to criminal penalties, and creates a public hazard."" Id. at 62. The majority also stated, however, that on 
remand ""Polymer must show more than its quality control efforts."" Id. at 63. Here there is no repackaging and no alteration of the 
contents labeling, use instructions, or warnings; nor is there any claim of FDA violation. We further note in respect to the claim of "
1612,," unauthorized distribution, the Mimran majority, citing Hayden, stated that ""the element of consumer confusion must also be 
present."" Mimran at 63. There is no such showing here."
1612,3," Because section 1125(a) was substantially amended in 1988, the amendment taking effect after this action was filed, a 
threshold issue with regard to this second theory is whether to apply the pre- or post-amendment version of section 
1125(a). Fortunately, the answer does not matter. Congress, in amending section 1125(a), intended merely ""to codify the 
interpretation [pre-amendment section 1125(a) ] has been given by the courts."" S.Rep. No. 515, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 40, 
reprinted in 1988 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 5577, 5603. See McNeil--P.C.C., Inc. v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 938 F.2d 
1544, 1548 n. 1 (2d Cir.1991); ALPO Petfoods, Inc. v. Ralston Purina Co., 286 U.S. App. D.C. 192, 913 F.2d 958, 963-64 n. 
6 (D.C.Cir.1990). We refer to the post-amendment text of section 1125(a) in this decision. "
1613,4," Cf.  WCVB-TV v. Boston Athletic Ass'n, 926 F.2d 42 (1st Cir.1991) (television station did not violate 15 U.S.C. §§ 1114 
or 1125(a) in televising Boston Marathon using plaintiff's ""Boston Marathon"" trademark)."
1613,5," Though nominally appealing a claim under the Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law, LSA-
RS § 51:1401, Matrix makes no separate argument nor cites any cases construing that statute in its briefs to this Court. 
Further, the district court considered Matrix's section 51:1401 state law claims together with the Lanham Act claims. 
For these reasons we affirm, without separate discussion, the district court's grant of summary judgment with regard 
to Matrix's Louisiana law claims."
1613,6," On appeal, Emporium raises only conspiracy claims under section 1 of the Sherman Act. "
1619,1," Failure to Carry Out Review in Accordance With By-Laws (Count I); Breach of Contract (Count II); Arbitrary, Capricious, and 
Unreasonable Decision (Count III); Wrongful Termination (Count IV); Unfair or Deceptive Trade Practices (Count V); Tortious 
Interference With Contractual Relations and Prospective Economic Advantage (Count IX); Libel and Slander (Count X)."
1619,2," Violation of Civil Rights Under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 (Count VI); Discriminatory Employment Practices Under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2 
(Count VII); Conspiracy to Violate Civil Rights Under 42 U.S.C. 1985(3) (Count VIII)."
1619,3," HN1[
] Section 151:13-a, II provides: Records of a hospital committee organized to evaluate matters relating to the care and treatment of patients or to reduce 
morbidity and mortality and testimony by hospital trustees, medical staff, employees, or other committee attendees relating 
to activities of the quality assurance committee shall be confidential and privileged and shall be protected from direct or 
indirect means of discovery, subpoena, or admission into evidence in any judicial or administrative proceeding, except that 
in the case of a legal action brought by a quality assurance committee to revoke or restrict a physician's license or hospital 
staff privileges, or in a proceeding alleging repetitive malicious action and personal injury brought against a physician, a 
committee's records shall be discoverable. N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 151:13-a, II (1990). "
1620,4," The hospital does not contend that the quality assurance privilege it asserts is derived from the Health Care Quality 
Improvement Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C. § 11101, et seq. Thus, cases which evaluate a quality assurance privilege claim under this 
statute are inapplicable. See, e.g., LeMasters v. Christ Hosp., 791 F. Supp. 188, 191-92 (S.D. Ohio 1991); Teasdale v. Marin 
Gen. Hosp., 138 F.R.D. 691, 694 (N.D. Cal. 1991). "
1621,5," Counsel for the defendants conceded during oral argument that their construction of the privilege would allow a hospital to 
shield from discovery even explicit and direct evidence that a physician's privileges had been terminated for an obviously 
improper reason such as racial discrimination."
1621,6," Defendants identified only two instances in which a hospital might commence a lawsuit in connection with a physician privilege 
revocation decision. The first was a declaratory judgment action to obtain a ruling on the hospital's right to revoke a physician's 
privileges. The second was an action for injunctive relief to bar a discharged physician from the hospital grounds. Either action "
1622,," would be highly unlikely, if not unprecedented. Moreover, neither action is truly a proceeding to revoke or restrict a physician's 
hospital privileges. "
