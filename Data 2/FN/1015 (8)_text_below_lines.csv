43,2," First Central and Great American obtained judgment against Interchange for approximately $ 311,000 in damages. That 
decision was appealed, however the parties settled prior to argument in the Appellate Division. The Appellate Division order 
reflecting that event states that all judgments against Interchange have been vacated. We do not rely on that order in arriving at 
our conclusion here."
43,3, Interchange has not appealed from the dismissal of the negligent supervision claim of its amended complaint. 
44,4," Defendants William Bravakis and Gerald Veglia joined Trico in this motion. Consequently, they were also granted summary 
judgment on this count. "
45,5," Interchange also argues that the trial court incorrectly relied upon Trico's assertion that Interchange's own negligence caused 
its harm. However, the trial court did not base its decision to grant summary judgment on this issue. Instead Judge Murphy 
focused completely on whether acts attributable to Trico were the proximate cause of Interchange's injuries under a RICO 
analysis. Because Interchange's argument is based upon what it labels the ""implications"" of Trico's position, and not upon the 
true basis of the trial court decision, we focus solely on the proximate cause issue. "

inadmissible hearsay or speculation, or that plaintiffs have not established a sufficient foundation for their admission into 
evidence. As stated in this court's memorandum opinion and order of this date, it denies movants' motion to strike plaintiffs' 
evidentiary materials. However, no finding is made as to whether or not the materials may be admissible as proof of factual 
assertions made within them. This report looks to plaintiffs' evidentiary materials for the sole purpose of ascertaining what 
plaintiffs hope to prove in this case."

75,6," At this juncture, the court expresses no opinion as to whether discovery is needed to resolve the question of personal 
jurisdiction. While many pertinent facts could conceivably be addressed by affidavits, the present record is so clearly insufficient 
that the court does not consider whether pertinent facts are peculiarly within movant's knowledge. See Kamen v. American Tel.

makes no allegations of misconduct by these Defendants, and it staled that they are named in this action as necessary parties to 
implement any relief the Court should grant. See Complaint PP 6-12, 24; Fed. R. Civ. P. 19."
84,2," College Station has filed a Brief Regarding Inapplicability of State Action Doctrine [Doc. #18]. The brief was faxed to chambers 
on December 27, 1995, one day after this Court issued the opinion denying preliminary injunctive relief. The Court has reviewed 
the brief and is satisfied that this amended opinion satisfactorily addresses the arguments it presents."
84,3," The Court heard testimony proffered by College Station from Robert Pohl, the Electric Division Manager of College Station, 
Samuel C. Hadaway, an expert on energy regulatory matters, Gailord White (see n. 1), and Bryan's City Manager Conduff; who 
also serves as Chairman of TMPP. The Court received in evidence the affidavits of Linda Piwonka, Executive Director for 
Management Services for College Station, on the history of dealings between Bryan and College Station on energy matters, and 
Whitfield A. Russell, proffered as an expert on electric production and transmission planning, on the essential nature of 
Defendant Bryan and TMPA's transmission facilities to College Station, the workings of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas 
(""ERCOT""), and wheeling practices within it. Defendants objected to the admission of these affidavits but when invited to cross- "
85,," examine the affiants who were present in court on December 19 or 20, or to submit counter-affidavits, they did not do so. 
Defendants called William B. Townsend, Jr., a representative of TMPP, to testify concerning the mechanics of TMPP's 
implementation of a change of power supply for College Station from TMPA to TU. The Court rejected Defendants' proffer of an 
affidavit from one of the defense counsel in this matter, which was offered as an expert's view of work currently being 
undertaken by the Public Utility Commission of Texas on potential revisions to the methods for setting wheeling rates. The 
affidavit would have been cumulative."
85,4," Defendants initially argued that the primary jurisdiction doctrine deprived this Court of authority to adjudicate any of these 
parties' disputes, since the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (""FERC"") or the Public Utility Commission of Texas 
(""PUCT""), and not a court, is the proper body to set transmission rates. However, at the injunction hearing on December 19, 
1995, Defendants conceded that the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action. They nevertheless continue to argue 
that fundamentally this dispute should be handled by expert administrative agencies. Primary jurisdiction is ""a flexible doctrine to 
be applied at the discretion of the district court."" Wagner & Brown v. ANR Pipeline Co., 837 F.2d 199, 201 (5th Cir. 1988). At this 
preliminary injunction hearing stage of the case, the primary jurisdiction doctrine is not a bar to this Court's jurisdiction. See, e.g., 
Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359, 93 S. Ct. 1022 (1973); City of Chanute v. Kansas Gas 
and Electric Co., 564 F. Supp. 1416, 1423 (D. Kan. 1983), rev'd in part on other grounds and aff'd in pertinent part, 754 F.2d 310 
(10th Cir. 1985). However, in light of the Court's rulings below, it is unclear what relief College Station continues to seek other 
than the imposition by the Court of a ""fair"" price pending an administrative determination of the rate issues. To the extent price is 
the chief remaining issue, the Court's continued involvement is questionable. See Gulf States Utilities Co. v. Alabama Power 
Co., 824 F.2d 1465, 1469-71 (5th Cir. 1987). See infra, at 27. "
86,5," The transcript of the preliminary injunction hearing has not yet been made available to the Court. Therefore, no page 
references are possible and citations in this memorandum to the testimony are necessarily from notes by the Court."
86,6," It is therefore unclear what relief, if any, College Station now seeks against IMPP and its agents. "
87,7," The timing may well have been a function of Bryan's continuing interest in being considered as the supplier of the energy. See 
Piwonka Aff., at 2-3. Nevertheless, College Station may have been operating on an unrealistic schedule. "
89,8," The Court notes that one Defendant, TMPP, is not a municipality. Therefore, in order to obtain state action immunity, TMPP 
would be required to establish not only that there be a clearly articulated state policy, but also that the state of Texas ""actively 
supervises"" the anticompetitive conduct. California Retail Liquor Dealers Association v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 105, 
63 L. Ed. 2d 233, 100 S. Ct. 937 (1980); DFW Metro Line v. Southwestern Bell, 988 F.2d 601, 605 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 510 
U.S. 864, 114 S. Ct. 183, 126 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1993). Given Texas' regulation of the electric industry, as discussed below, this 
requirement probably would be satisfied and, if so, state action immunity would apply to TMPP. "
90,," However, it is not necessary to reach this question. College Station's counsel explained to the Court at the outset of the 
injunction hearing that Defendant TMPP was named only as a necessary party to ensure that College Station could obtain 
complete relief In any event, College Station's only allegation about TMPP was that it was acting in concert with the other 
Defendants by refusing to sign the Remote Control Area Load (""RCAL"") Agreement, which governs the mechanics of the 
wheeling procedures, The RCAL Agreement between TU and TMPP was executed on December 20, 1995. Therefore, there no 
longer appears to be any case or controversy in this action involving TMPP."
90,9," The DFW Court looked to the Public Utilities Regulatory Act as it then existed, codified at TEX. REV. CIV. STAT. ANN. Art. 
l446c (West Supp. 1989). The statute has recently been amended by the Texas legislature; however, the current language is 
substantially the same as that relied upon in DFW."
90,10," College Station has cited this Court to Amtel Communications v. P.U.C. of Texas, 687 S.W.2d 95, 100-01 (Tex. App. -- Austin, 
1985, no writ), a case concerning the telecommunications industry which observed that PURA contains ""provisions that are 
distinctly 'antitrust' in nature and reflect a definite public policy in favor of competition as a regulating or controlling force 
applicable to public utilities,"" and that, in some instances, ""PURA does not insulate a public utility from the forces of competition 
and, indeed, prohibits anticompetitive practices by the utility."" Amtel, 687 S.W.2d at 100 (emphasis in original). However, the 
Amtel Court concluded that, ""given these rather definite and clear pronouncements of competing policies, it cannot reasonably 
be doubted that the Legislature intended the [Public Utility] Commission to make, where necessary and desirable in the 
particular case, whatever adjustments and accommodations it considers necessary to effectuate the public interests underlying 
both competition and monopoly power."" Id. at 101 (emphasis in original). "
92,11," The Ninth Circuit commented on a similar circumstance as follows: Put bluntly, [plaintiff cities] desired to benefit their customers at the expense of all the other customers of [the electric utility]. 
We cannot express surprise at the cities' single-minded desire to benefit their own -- it is much like [the utility's] single-
minded attention to its rate demands. However, we also cannot say that [the utility's] refusal [to provide the facility] lacked a 
reasonable business justification. City of Anaheim, 955 F.2d at 1381."
92,12," Furthermore, the courts have recognized that HN12[
] a successful ""essential facilities"" plaintiff must prove that denial of 
access has caused it ""severe handicap."" Twin Laboratories, 900 F.2d 566 at 569 (relying on evidence that plaintiff's profits were 
continuing in finding no severe handicap); City of Chanute, Kan. v. Williams Natural Gas Co., 955 F.2d 641, 648 (10th Cir. 
1992). A showing of inconvenience or even ""some economic loss"" is not sufficient. Twin Labs, 900 F.2d at 570; City of Chanute, 
955 F.2d at 648; Alaska Airlines, 948 F.2d at 544."
92,13," ComparePlaintiff's Exhs. 11 & 12 (the Bryan and TMPA proposed wheeling contracts) (for 127.88 megawatts (""MW"")) with 
Plaintiff's Exhs. 34 (agreement between TMPA and Lower Colorado River Authority) (for 35 MW) & 24 (agreement between 
TMPA and Rayburn Electric Cooperative) (for 42.5 MW). Each contract was based on megawatt mile charges, a rate 
inapplicable to the parties' needs here."
92,14," See Laurel Sand & Gravel, Inc. v. CSX Transportation, Inc., 924 F.2d 539, 544 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 814, 116 L. 
Ed. 2d 39, 112 S. Ct. 64 (1991) (defendant's offer, which was one penny per ton above the defendant's own variable costs, was 
reasonable); Delaware and Hudson Rwy., 902 F.2d at 180 (genuine issue of material fact existed, so as to require a trial, on the "
93,," issue of the reasonableness of the defendants' offered price; defendants had demanded a rate amounting to an 800% increase 
over prior rates). College Station's expert, Mr. Hadaway, explained that, in his view, the costs sought to be charged by Bryan and IMPA were 
above those submitted to the PUCT by these entities and by other utilities. He opined that they were above the standard 
wheeling charges in the industry. He acknowledges that TMPA has recently completed construction that may be responsible for 
some portion of these Defendants' high fees. He stated his belief that the Defendants' costs were miscalculated; they were too 
high principally because the costs set forth in Plaintiff's Exhibit 21 (material provided to College Station by Defendants in 
December, 1995, prior to the Suit, to explain the wheeling charges being requested) were based on each of the respective cities' 
(plus TMPA's) expenses in connection with all their transmission facilities. Mr. Hadaway acknowledged that if his assumption 
(that the individual cities' costs are included in the TMPA figures) were incorrect, then his conclusions as to the inflated level of 
the IMPA and Bryan rates would be undercut somewhat. He apparently also believes that a more reasonable approach would be 
for IMPA and Bryan to impose a joint charge that relates to the costs of constructing and operating only these Defendants' 
transmission lines necessary to wheel power to College Station. He acknowledged that he had little knowledge of the 
transmission system of TMPA and Bryan as it exists now, since much of his firsthand knowledge of these systems was gained 
over ten years ago when he worked for the PUCT. Defendant Gailord White, on behalf of TMPA, established that he personally had made both the earlier, lower (August 1995) 
calculations and the later computations on which the proposed contracts were based (December 1995). He had discovered in 
the interim that there were errors in the originally presented figures but the December proposal for TMPA reflected what he then 
believed, and now believes, are the correct figures for TMPA's own construction and operating costs statewide. It will take 
significant time and expertise to evaluate those calculations -- which is the function of the PUCT or FERC, not this Court."
93,15," It does not appear that Defendants' conduct has interfered with the TU contract to date. The problem seems to be College 
Station's insistence on wheeling rates that it deems to be the market rate (without regard to Defendants' particular 
circumstances). "
94,16," See, e.g, Plaintiff's Exh. 34 (TMPA Agreement for Transmission Wheeling Service with Lower Colorado River Authority, May, 
3 1995), PP 8.1, 8.2."
94,17," See Defendants' Exhibit #4 (PUCT Substantive Rules), § 23.66(d)(5)(B)."
94,18," Defendants also argue that, as municipal corporations and officials acting within the course and scope of their duties, they are 
immune from tort claims, citing Kelly v. Galveston County, 520 S.W.2d 507 (Tex. Civ. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1975, no writ). 
The Court does not reach this issue, although it may have merit. To the extent Defendants intend to pursue this line of argument, 
they may submit additional authorities as indicated at the end of this order. "
95,19," The Court announced to the parties that it accepted and would be relying upon Defendants' and their counsel's 
representations, and that Defendants would be held to these promises."
95,20," This sentence (which is a good summary of these disputed provisions generally) was: ""It is specifically understood and agreed 
by the Parties the rates and charges specified in this Agreement shall remain in effect during the term of this Agreement and 
shall not be subject to change by any Party through application to the FERC pursuant to [various provisions] of the Federal 
Power Act or otherwise, or through application to the PUCT pursuant to provisions of the Public Utility Regulatory Act, or 
otherwise."" The Defendants, however, did not offer to delete the following sentence, which provided: ""It is the intention of the 
Parties that this Agreement shall in all events continue in effect in accordance with its terms until terminated or canceled in 
accordance with the provisions hereof"" Thus, College Station argues that Defendants will retain arguments that may prevent 
retroactivity and therefore College Station will be prejudiced before the regulatory agencies if it enters into any wheeling contract."
95,21," Defendants clarified before this Court on December 19th that their position is that either side should be able to seek any relief 
it wishes from PUC and FERC. Defendants specifically stated that they were not agreeing that a FERC rate established some 
time in the future could become retroactive to January 1, 1996, and that they would argue before the agencies that the contract 
in effect between the parties would prohibit the agencies from ordering that a rate be effective retroactively. See also 
""Defendants' Brief Supporting Their Motion That Plaintiff's Motion for Injunction Be Denied, and Supporting Their Motion to 
Dismiss, or in the Alternative, Motion to Stay,"" at 2 n. 1. "
96,22," While it is not entirely clear whether or not FERC could order such retroactive relief in this context, the courts have recognized 
that Commission has the power to act in the interest of equity and, in some situations, to grant retroactive relief. See, e.g. Mid 
Louisiana Gas Co. v. F.E.RC., 780 F.2d 1238, 1247 & n. 13 (gas company may file with FERC to retroactively recover rates for 
period between effective date of statute and FERC orders); Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. v. F.E.R.C., 769 F.2d 1053 (5th 
Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1114, 90 L. Ed. 2d 653, 106 S. Ct. 1968, 106 S. Ct. 1969 (1986) (FERC may act in equity to 
decide whether or not to make production-related allowances retroactive). Compare Gulf States Utilities v. Alabama Power Co., 
824 F.2d 1465, 1471 (5th Cir.) (contracting party may not sue to change a filed rate, and FERC may not order retroactive 
alterations or reparations for such a rate), amended on other grounds, 831 F.2d 557 (1987)."
96,23," To the extent that the court in Pine Ridge Recycling, Inc. v. Butts County, Georgia, 864 F. Supp. 1338, 1342 (M.D. Ga. 1994), 
reached a contrary result, this Court declines to follow that lead. Moreover, since it is unlikely that College Station would succeed 
on the merits of its antitrust claims for the reasons set forth above, this issue is academic."
96,24," It is possible that the parties may reach a contract for a shorter term than the entire period of the TU-College Station 
agreement. Defendants' counsel indicated on the record at the hearing that his clients may negotiate on this issue; however, 
College Station has not to the Court's knowledge expressed any willingness to pursue this course. "
101,1," Although the plaintiff fails to specifically cite the particular statutes he claims the defendants' violated, the court concludes that 
the complaint sets forth a cause of action under Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 35-26 and 27. "
102,2," The plaintiff alleges that the plaintiff's theater draws customers from the New Haven metropolitan area, but more specifically, 
from the towns of East Haven, Hamden, North Branford, North Haven, New Haven, Branford and Guilford. The defendant, 
National Amusements, contends that the Showcase Orange draws customers from the New Haven metropolitan area, more 
specifically, from the towns of East Haven, Hamden, North Branford, North Haven, New Haven, Branford, Guilford, West Haven, 
Orange, Ansonia, Bridgeport, Stratford, Woodbridge, Bethany and Milford."
102,3, The plaintiff agrees that the Showcase Orange is one of the ten best theaters in New England.
102,4, The plaintiff concedes that clearances are granted only between theaters which are in substantial competition.
102,5," Specifically, the Showcase Orange, and the plaintiff's theater have, respectively, eight and four screens upon which to exhibit 
motion pictures. When the Showcase Orange has been granted a clearance over the plaintiff's theater, the plaintiff's theater 
must exhibit a different motion picture. Therefore, the Showcase Orange and the plaintiff's theater can simultaneously exhibit at 
least twelve different motion pictures. "
103,6," The plaintiff acknowledges that the plaintiff's theater and the Showcase North Haven are competitors. Accordingly, the plaintiff's 
complaint alleges only that the clearances granted to the Showcase Orange constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade."
103,7," HN2[
] In Connecticut, the courts are guided in their interpretation of the Connecticut anti-trust act by Federal precedent. 
Specifically, in Westport Taxi Service v. Westport Transit District, 235 Conn. 1, 5 n.17, 664 A.2d 719 (1995), the Connecticut 
supreme court concluded that: it is the intent of the general assembly that in construing sections 35-24 to 35-46, inclusive, the courts of this state shall be 
guided by interpretations given by the federal courts to federal statutes . . . . Accordingly, we follow federal precedent when 
we interpret the act unless the text of our anti-trust statutes, or other state law, requires us to interpret it differently. Here, the plaintiff alleges violations of the Connecticut anti-trust act. Consequently, the court applies federal law with respect to 
the plaintiff's claims unless stated otherwise. "
104,8," The court in Orson, Inc. v. Miramax Film Corp., 862 F. Supp. 1378, 1383-84 nn.4-5, (E.D. Pa. 1994), stated that ""the term 
'vertical restraint' describes an agreement between two or more companies on different levels in the chain of product 
distribution."" "
105,9," On pages 51:2-4 and 87:19-24 of his deposition, the plaintiff acknowledged that the Showcase Orange was one of his 
competitors. In paragraph 25(a) of his complaint, the plaintiff alleges that clearances ""may be granted only between theaters 
which are substantially competitive."" The plaintiff has previously bid for clearances in the same manner as had the defendant, 
National Amusements, wherein the successful bidder operates to the economic disadvantage to the loser. Specifically, between 
1989 and 1991, the plaintiff did ask the defendant distributors to grant the plaintiff's theater clearances over the Showcase 
Orange. The plaintiff further claims that his theater would draw patrons from the Showcase Orange if the plaintiff's theater was 
allowed to simultaneously exhibit the same films. The court concludes that the clearances are used to allow the defendant, 
National Amusements, to receive an income that would be diminished if the plaintiff's theater was allowed to simultaneously 
exhibit the same film as the Showcase Orange. Therefore, the court further concludes that these facts reinforce the conclusion 
that the plaintiff's theater and the Showcase Orange are substantially competing. "
106,10," Intrabrand competition is the competition between theaters simultaneously exhibiting the same film. Interbrand competition is 
the competition between two films and ""is the primary concern of antitrust law."" Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 
U.S. 36, 52 n.19, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977)."
106,11," The initial exhibition of a motion picture is termed ""first-run."" ""Sub-run"" movies are exhibited only after they have been 
exhibited ""first-run."""
106,12," Illustratively, if the Showcase Orange is granted clearances to exhibit eight motion pictures upon its eight screens, the 
plaintiff's theater is forced to exhibit four different motion pictures. Therefore, twelve different motion pictures are available for 
consumers in the New Haven metropolitan area. Accordingly, if the Showcase Orange was not granted a clearance over the 
plaintiff's theater and the plaintiff was able to simultaneously exhibit the same motion pictures with the Showcase Orange, the 
overall choice of motion pictures available to the New Haven metropolitan area would be eight."
106,13," Because the plaintiff has failed to establish the unreasonableness of the restraint of trade, the court does not address the 
remaining elements of an antitrust conspiracy claim. "
107,14," HN8[
] Conn. Gen. Stat. § 35-27 provides, inter alia, that: ""every contract, combination, or conspiracy to monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or monopolization of any part of trade or commerce is unlawful."""
107,15," Plaintiff's memorandum in opposition to defendant National Amusements' motion for summary judgment, pg. 4."
107,16," As stated earlier, the court is guided by federal precedent except if state law provides additional interpretation."
107,17," The court recognizes that there are additional elements in establishing causes of action for monopolization and attempted 
monopolization. However, given that the plaintiff has failed to establish anti-competitive conduct on the part of the defendants, 
the court need not address the merits of the additional elements. "

did not provide a cogent explanation as to how alleged restraints on trade diminished competition in relevant markets.  Banks, 
977 F.2d at 1093-1094. Similarly, the court of appeals rejected a plaintiff's conclusory allegations of antitrust injury in another 
case, where the facts alleged made the plaintiff's theory utterly implausible.  Car Carriers, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 745 F.2d 1101, 
1110 (7th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1054, 84 L. Ed. 2d 821, 105 S. Ct. 1758 (1985). Both Banks and Car Carriers were 
decided prior to Leatherman, however. Since Hammes did not discuss Banks or Car Carriers, it is not clear whether, in the absence of a heightened pleading standard, 
conclusory allegations of elements of antitrust injury can compensate for gaps in the facts pleaded in support of a plaintiff's 
antitrust theory. Depending on the circumstances, the gaps may be such that the plaintiff has failed to plead the essential 
elements of its claim. While Hammes accepted a conclusory jurisdictional allegation of effect on interstate commerce, it noted 
that the conclusion was consistent with the factual allegations of the complaint. Hammes did not foreclose inquiry into whether, 
based on the pleaded facts, a plaintiff's antitrust theory is plausible. See Hammes, 33 F.3d at 782-783. This court also bears in 
mind the observation in Car Carriers that HN4[
] courts are ""not required to don blinders and to ignore commercial reality"" 
when considering the sufficiency of antitrust claims. Id."
115,4," HN5[
] The relevant market for antitrust cases is determined by choices available to consumers. Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 482, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265, 112 S. Ct. 2072 (1992). There are two components to the 
definition of relevant market--a product market and a geographic market.  Bathke v. Casey's General Stores, Inc., 64 F.3d 340, "
116,345," (8th Cir. 1995). In making the determination as to the relevant product market, a court ""must decide whether the product is 
unique or has close substitutes, as to which there are substantial cross-elasticities of demand."" Fishman v. Estate of Wirtz, 807 
F.2d 520, 531 (7th Cir. 1986) (citation omitted). Plaintiff's ability to establish a product market has not been challenged, however, 
and the Supreme Court has indicated that in some instances, one brand of a product can constitute a separate market. Eastman 
Kodak, 504 U.S. at 482. But see 2 Carl W. Kintner, Federal Antitrust Law § 13.2 at 411 (1980) (commenting that only a few 
courts have limited a relevant product market to the defendant's own product). Plaintiff's ability to establish geographic market would at first blush seem more problematical, as the geographic market for 
antitrust purposes is the geographic area to which consumers can practically turn for alternative sources of the product, and in 
which the antitrust defendant encounters competition. Morgenstern v. Wilson, 29 F.3d 1291, 1296 (8th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 
130 L. Ed. 2d 1068, 115 S. Ct. 1100 (1995). See also Israel Travel Advisory Serv. v. Israel Identity Tours, Inc., 61 F.3d 1250, 
1252 (7th Cir. 1995) (""a market is defined to aid in identifying any ability to raise price by curtailing output""). Since the relevant 
question would be where customers would have to turn to for the products and services rendered by service stations, Marathon 
argues that the market is defined too narrowly. Marathon does not separately address the market for its own branded products. "
117,5," HN8[
] Section 1981 provides as follows: (a) Statement of equal rights All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and 
enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the 
security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, 
taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other."
117,*," * * (c) Protection against impairment The rights protected by this section are protected against impairment by nongovernmental discrimination and impairment 
under color of State law."
117,42," U.S.C. § 1981(a) and (c). HN9[
] Under § 1982, ""all citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property."" 42 U.S.C. § 1982."
117,6," Marathon correctly observes that § 1981 is inapplicable to claims of discrimination on the basis of religion. Runyon v. McCrary, 
427 U.S. 160, 167, 49 L. Ed. 2d 415, 96 S. Ct. 2586 (1976). "
118,7," Although the contract between plaintiff and Stronach was conditioned on plaintiff obtaining approval as a Marathon franchisee, 
plaintiff alleges only that Stronach leased and operated the gas station. Cmplt., PP5, 8. However, he has referred to the gas 
station operation as a franchise. Cmplt., P26. There being no indications in the parties' pleadings to the contrary, this court 
cannot rule out the possibility that Stronach was party to a franchise agreement with Marathon. Accordingly, the closest analogy 
to the fact situation in plaintiff's complaint would be a franchisee's decision to sell its business to a purchaser that will have to 
obtain a franchise from the franchisor."
118,8, This memorandum makes no finding as to whether the franchise relationship at issue here is regulated by statute. 
119,9," Marathon argues that its conduct was lawful, in that a franchisor has a right to refuse to deal with a potential franchisee, but 
nothing in the complaint indicates that Marathon's contract with Stronach provided for such right. Nor has Marathon argued that 
statute confers the asserted right upon it, as has been argued in the previously cited decisions dealing with similar claims. Even 
assuming the existence of a franchisor's right to refuse to deal or to take over the franchise itself, however, the allegations of 
plaintiff's complaint are consistent with an inference that Marathon exercised that right for the unlawful purpose of discriminating 
against plaintiff. "
120,10," At various points in the course of this decision, this court has described the action complained of as a refusal by Marathon to 
deal with plaintiff. Use of those terms should not be interpreted as a finding as to the appropriate characterization of plaintiff's 
claim. Notably, too, the court's decision concerning Count I would be unaltered even if cast as pressure put on Stronach to 
induce the sale of his business to Marathon. Since plaintiff has not alleged the requisite injury to competition, antitrust injury 
would still not be allowed. "

Misericordia Division, Ohio State University Hospital, Our Lady of Mercy Medical Center, Riverside Methodist Hospitals, Saint 
Francis Medical Center, Tri-City Medical Center, and University Hospital at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, 
have filed motions to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), however, as the Decision and Order, filed 
April 29, 1994, indicates, these motions are not before the court at this time. These motions will be addressed, as will the motion 
for certification of the class, in accordance with the scheduling order issued simultaneously with this Report and 
Recommendation. "
167,3," As the court may consider material outside the pleadings in ruling on a motion to dismiss, including affidavits, depositions, and 
other documentary proof, see Bruan, Gordon & Co. v. Hellmers, 502 F. Supp. 897 (S.D.N.Y. 1980), and substantial discovery 
has taken place with respect to the jurisdictional issues, but Plaintiffs failed to respond to Defendants' Statements of Undisputed 
Facts, this court will not convert these motions to dismiss to motions for summary judgment. See, e.g., Timberlane Lumber Co. 
v. Bank of America Nat. Trust & Savings Assoc., 749 F.2d 1378, 1381-82 & 1381 n.1 (9th Cir. 1984) (in case alleging illegal 
antitrust behavior, trial court properly analyzed defendant's motion under Rule 12(b)(1) without affording summary judgment 
treatment, notwithstanding plaintiff's contention that the question of jurisdiction is so closely intertwined with the merits that 
summary judgment was appropriate), cert. denied, 472 U.S. 1032, 87 L. Ed. 2d 643, 105 S. Ct. 3514 (1985). As Plaintiffs have 
had jurisdictional discovery regarding the issues discussed in their Report and Recommendation, they have the burden of 
demonstrating jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. See Landoil Resources v. Alexander & Alexander Services, Inc., 
918 F.2d 1039, 1043 (2d Cir. 1990); Chrysler Capital Corp. v. Century Power Corp., 778 F. Supp. 1260, 1266 (S.D.N.Y. 1991) 
(citing Marine Midland Bank N.A. v. Miller, 664 F.2d 899, 904 (2d Cir. 1981)). However, as no hearing or trial on the merits has 
been heard by the court, all pleadings and affidavits must be construed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs. See Hoffritz for 
Cutlery, Inc. v. Amajac, Ltd., 763 F.2d 55, 57 (2d Cir. 1985)."
167,4," Defendants Our Lady of Mercy, Henry A. Thiede, and Frank A. Disney, did not move to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds, 
therefore these Defendants will not be discussed in this Report and Recommendation. Additionally, as Porter Memorial 
Hospital's settlement with the Plaintiffs, under which the action was dismissed as to Porter, was approved by Judge Arcara on 
September 21, 1994, Porter is no longer a party to this action. As will be discussed, various Defendants, which are 
governmentally sponsored hospitals, assert immunity under the Eleventh Amendment, the state action doctrine, and the Local 
Government Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 34-36."
167,5," By Order entered April 29, 1994, this court stayed general merit-based discovery but permitted discovery limited to jurisdiction 
and immunity to be completed by August 12, 1994. On July 26, 1994, the court ordered, upon Plaintiffs' motion to compel, the 
scope of permitted discovery was modified to permit Plaintiffs discovery related to its conspiracy based jurisdictional theory. On 
August 8, 1994, the overall period for jurisdiction discovery was extended to September 16, 1994. "
168,6," Should the District Judge not find, as recommended, see Discussion Sections I(a)(2) and I(b)(3), that Oregon Health Sciences 
University Hospital is immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment or the state action doctrine, then it is subject to personal 
jurisdiction pursuant to Section 12 of the Clayton Act. "
170,7," HN6[
] Eleventh Amendment immunity can be waived, see Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corp. v. Hess, 495 U.S. 299, 305,"
170,109," L. Ed. 2d 264, 110 S. Ct. 1868 (1990), however, Plaintiffs have not raised the issue of waiver."
170,8," Public higher education is a purpose of state government of each of the states sponsoring the public hospital Defendants as 
established by state constitutional or legislative mandate, thus, each of the entities involved in the immunity analysis is carrying 
out an incident of the state's sovereign power, as opposed to the functions carried out in Hess, supra (a local transportation 
facility) and Lake Country Estates, supra (regional land use controls), where the functions were municipal or local in nature."
170,9," The Supreme Court has indicated that HN7[
] political subdivisions of the state, such as cities, towns, and counties, are 
distinct legal entities which, although territorially within the state, function as independent governmental units and are not entitled 
to Eleventh Amendment immunity. See Hess, supra, at 402 (citing Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation v. Feeney, 495 U.S. 
299, 313, 109 L. Ed. 2d 264, 110 S. Ct. 1868 (1990) (Brennan, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)); Mount 
Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 280, 50 L. Ed. 2d 471, 97 S. Ct. 568 (1977). "
171,10," Several courts have taken the position that HN9[
] protection of the state's treasury is the most important element in deciding whether Eleventh Amendment immunity should be afforded to a defendant, see, e.g., Baxter, supra, at 732-33 (most significant 
factor is whether entity has the power to raise its own funds); Hutsell v. Sayre, 5 F.3d 996, 999 (6th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 
U.S. 1119, 114 S. Ct. 1071, 127 L. Ed. 2d 389 (1994) (most important factor is whether a judgment will be paid from the state 
treasury); Metcalf & Eddy, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, 991 F.2d 935, 942-43 (1st Cir. 1993) (inability to 
use state treasury or pledge credit leaves entity un-shielded by the Eleventh Amendment). The Second Circuit has also 
indicated that ""in cases where doubt has existed as to the availability of Eleventh Amendment immunity, the Supreme Court has 
emphasized the exposure of the state treasury as a critical factor."" Feeney, supra, at 631."
171,11," These hospital Defendants include Ohio State University Hospital Medical Center, Oregon Health Sciences University 
Hospital, University of California (Los Angeles) Medical Center, University of California (Irvine) Medical Center, University of 
California (San Diego) Medical Center, University Hospital at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, University 
Hospital at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, and University of Massachusetts Medical Center."
171,12," The court notes that HN10[
] Eleventh Amendment immunity protects a state or the arm or instrumentality of a state where a plaintiff seeks damages and/or injunctive relief.  Alabama v. Pugh, 438 U.S. 781, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1114, 98 S. Ct. 3057 (1978). 
However, certain types of prospective injunctive relief are not barred by the Eleventh Amendment, including an order that 
reinstatement be granted or that a reinstatement hearing be conducted.  Russell v. Dunston, 896 F.2d 664, 668 (2d Cir.), cert. 
denied, 498 U.S. 813, 112 L. Ed. 2d 26, 111 S. Ct. 50 (1990). Further, if Congress was concerned that no remedy would be 
available for antitrust violations, it could abrogate the immunity provided by the Eleventh Amendment. Feeney, 495 U.S. at 304. 
See, e.g., Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U.S. 223, 105 L. Ed. 2d 181, 109 S. Ct. 2397 (1989)."
171,13," Bank of United States v. Planters' Bank of Georgia, 22 U.S. 904 (9 Wheat. 904, 6 L. Ed. 244) (1824); Briscoe v. Bank of 
Kentucky, 36 U.S. 257 (11 Pet.) 257, 9 L. Ed. 709 (1837); Ohio v. Helvering, 292 U.S. 360, 78 L. Ed. 1307, 54 S. Ct. 725 (1924), "
172,," as relied upon by Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law, at VI-10-14, are not to the contrary. In Planters' Banks, the state became a 
shareholder in private enterprise, in Briscoe, the court addressed the constitutionality of the bank of the commonwealth and its 
notes, and in Ohio, no Eleventh Amendment issue was involved. "

Annotated. "
174,15," University of Rhode Island v. A.W. Chesterton Company, 2 F.3d 1200, 1207 (1st Cir. 1993) (when the governor appoints 
members of the board with the advice and consent of the senate, courts often view this legislative design as evidence of an 
entity's lack of independence from state control). See, e.g., Lewis v. Midwestern State University, 837 F.2d 197, 198 (5th Cir.), 
cert. denied, 488 U.S. 849, 102 L. Ed. 2d 102, 109 S. Ct. 129 (1988); Harden v. Adams, 760 F.2d 1158, 1163 (11th Cir.), cert.

1984)."
174,16," HN17[
] Two of the eleven trustees are students at the Ohio State University. These members have no voting power and are 
not considered as members of the board in determining whether a quorum is present. The two student members are also 
appointed for two year terms by Ohio's governor, with the advice and consent of the state's senate, from a group of five 
candidates selected by the student government and approved by the OSU Trustees. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 3335.02(B)."
174,17," HN19[
] The bare power to sue or the capacity to be sued is unlikely to control the threshold determination in Eleventh Amendment immunity cases. See Kashani, supra, at 847 (power to sue and to be sued is not conclusive of autonomy). 
However, the power to sue or be sued in the entity's own name, when combined with other powers such as the power to 
contract, buy, sell, or hold property, undeniably afford the entity some additional independence from the state.  University of 
Rhode Island, supra, at 1207 n. 11. Additionally, a statute granting a state university the power to ""sue and be sued"" has been held insufficient to waive Eleventh 
Amendment immunity, and is interpreted as permitting only suits in state court. Ferguson v. Greater Pocatello Chamber of 
Commerce, Inc., 647 F. Supp. 190 (D. Idaho 1985), aff'd on other grounds, 848 F.2d 976 (9th Cir. 1988). Compare Hess, supra,

are initially signed by the executive director of the University Hospital, along with other appropriate officials within the university, 
on behalf of the University Hospital. Id. at 80-81."
175,19," The state of Ohio has not waived, as to the Ohio State University, the protection of the Eleventh Amendment by subjecting 
itself to suit in the state's court of claims. HN24[
] A waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity by a state or state agency must be clear and unequivocal. Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67, 104 S. Ct. 900 (1984). 
The only basis upon which Plaintiffs could argue, as to the University Hospital, such waiver is Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 
3335.03(B), which provides for suits against the OSU Trustees in Ohio's court of claims, and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 3335.03(A), 
which grants the OSU Trustees the ability to sue and be sued. See Footnote 17, supra. However, neither statute evidences a 
clear and unequivocal waiver of suit in federal court. ""[A] state's waiver of sovereign immunity in its own courts is not a waiver of 
the Eleventh Amendment immunity in the federal courts."" Pennhurst, supra, at 100 (citing Florida Department of Health & 
Rehabilitative Services v. Florida Nursing Home Association, 450 U.S. 147, 67 L. Ed. 2d 132, 101 S. Ct. 1032 (1981) and Great

as an integral part of the Oregon Health Sciences University."")."
179,23," HN38[
] In an Eleventh Amendment analysis, it is necessary for the court to consider the status of an entity at the time of decision as, if the court looks only to the organization and structure of an entity at the time suit is filed, and the entity is 
subsequently transformed by the state legislature into an arm or instrumentality of the state entitled to immunity from suit in 
federal court, the court would no longer have subject matter jurisdiction over the suit. Unless, as here, the current legal nature of 
the entity were given controlling effect, the result would be to potentially enter a judgment which, as a matter of fact and law, is 
barred by the Eleventh Amendment. "
180,," Oregon, by amendments to its enabling act, substantially altered the organization and status of Oregon Health Sciences 
University and its University Hospital, by legislation which became effective on July 1, 1995. See 1995 Or. Laws ch. 162, Or. 
Rev. Stat. §§ 352.002, 352.055 (1993). Accordingly, in this Report and Recommendation, the court discusses Oregon Health 
Sciences University Hospital based upon the amended legislation. However, even if this court were to have predicated its 
discussion upon the prior statutory scheme, which, among other things, provided that Oregon Health Sciences University was an 
""institution[] of higher education under the authority of the State Board of Higher Education,"" an arm of the state, Or. Rev. Stat. 
§§ 243.810, 276.905, 291.002, 351.060, 351.090, 351.150, 351.310, 351.470, 352.002, 352.055, the court finds that the Oregon 
Health Sciences University Hospital would be entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity as an arm of the state, and entitled to 
immunity under the state action doctrine for acting pursuant to a clearly articulated state policy. See Discussion Section I(b)(3), 
infra."

sued in federal court. See Florida Department of Health & Rehabilitation Services v. Florida Nursing Home Association, 450 U.S.

199,54," The fact that a defendant is not considered, for state action doctrine purposes, as the state itself is not necessarily inconsistent 
with a finding that Eleventh Amendment immunity is available as the state action doctrine focuses on the question of whether the 
challenged activity is authorized by the state, whereas an Eleventh Amendment analysis concentrates on the relationship of the 
defendant to the state, not whether a challenged action is authorized by it. That a defendant is in law and fact the legislative, "
200,," executive or judicial branch simply renders the authorization question unnecessary to answer. Thus, for example, a local 
government as a political subdivision would likely not be accorded immunity but may assert a state action doctrine defense. 
Even an agency outside the formal governmental structures may be able to assert the defense. Conversely, a state agency may 
be an arm of the state, thus entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, but acting without appropriate legislative authorization 
and thus unable to interpose the state action exemption. In the latter example, Eleventh Amendment immunity would render the 
state action contention moot."

] The state action doctrine confers an exemption from federal antitrust law upon the state, state agencies, and municipalities which act pursuant to a clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy. See Parker, supra. As the state 
action doctrine provides an exemption for certain actions of the state, and those acting according to the state's policy, including 
municipalities, the relief provided by the state action doctrine does not present the same type of limitation on the power of the 
federal courts that is carried by other defenses which may result in a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and which are not 
waivable by the parties. Thus, as Eleventh Amendment immunity can be waived without destroying subject matter jurisdiction

208,65," Although the HHC operates and administers Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center, the hospital is owned by the City of

Exhibit B, Art. I, § 1 (""Lease Agreement""). "
209,66," Plaintiffs' argue that lease Section 6.1, stating that the ""City agrees to keep, save and hold harmless the [HHC] from any and 
all liability, loss or damage arising from or in connection with the provision and delivery of health services, including any liability 
under the Workmen's Compensation Law,"" Lease Agreement § 6.1, provides only for indemnity from New York City in 
malpractice cases. Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law at VIII-5 - VIII-6, VIII-6 n. 3. Further, Plaintiffs assert that the relevant 
provision appears in Section 6.2(3), which indicates that New York City is not obligated to indemnify the medical schools, 
hospitals, or employees associated with the HHC as a result of any act committed by them, tortious or otherwise, other than an 
act of malpractice or act arising out of the treatment of patients. However, Section 6.2 indicates that New York City ""agrees to 
keep, save and hold harmless the [HHC] and its physicians and dentists, as well as the medical schools and voluntary hospitals 
with whom the [HHC] has an affiliation agreement . . . from any and all liability, loss or damage for malpractice of the [HHC], its 
physicians and dentists, arising from the operation or supervision of the hospitals transferred to the [HHC] …."" Lease Agreement 
Section 6.2. As Section 6.2 clearly provides financial protection to the HHC by New York City for malpractice by HHC physicians, 
Section 6.1 must be read as providing indemnity by the City of New York for other HHC liabilities arising ""in connection with the 
provision and delivery of health services."" Thus, it is unpersuasive for the Plaintiffs to assert that Section 6.1 also refers to 
indemnification for malpractice and thus excludes liability for damages arising from the instant action as to construe these 
provisions as Plaintiffs suggest would render one surplusage, contrary to general canons of contractual or statutory construction 
which require that all provisions of the body of a contract or legislation be given effect. Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman 
Hutton, Inc., 514 U.S. 52, 115 S. Ct. 1212, 1219, 131 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1995); Philbrook v. Glodgett, 421 U.S. 707, 713, 44 L. Ed. 2d 
525, 95 S. Ct. 1893 (1975). Further, when New York City's indemnity to the HHC varies with regard to entities or employees ""associated"" with HHC as 
addressed in Section 6.2(3), as compared to its obligations with respect to medical schools and hospitals covered under an 
affiliation agreement, is not explained in the record. "
210,67," This interpretation is also consistent with the fact that some entities may be state created and gubernatorially appointed yet 
retain an essentially local or regional focus of service or responsibility with attendant reliance on revenues generated solely or 
primarily from within such areas of operation. See, e.g., Trustees of A.J. Bremen, supra. Thus, although created by state law, the 
port authority in that case served an essentially local function, supported by revenues generated largely from within its service 
area. To the extent that Zapata Gulf Marine, supra, may be said to have held that the Puerto Rico Maritime Shipping Authority 
(""PRMSA"") is a special function governmental unit under the LGAA, such holding appears, to this court, contrary to the express 
purposes and definitions of the LGAA. As noted, the agencies considered in Trustees of A.J. Bremen, supra, and Palm Springs 
Medical Clinic, supra, although created by or pursuant to state law (as are all units of local government) served only local or 
regional interests, and were funded accordingly. Moreover, as the court in Zapata had already found the PRMSA to be immune 
under the Eleventh Amendment, its discussion of the LGAA applicability to the PRMSA may be fairly characterized as dicta. 
Further, should the Supreme Court determine in the future that, contrary to the holding in Ramirez v. Puerto Rico Fire Service, 
715 F.2d 694 (1st Cir. 1983), upon which Zapata relied, that Puerto Rico is not a state for Eleventh Amendment or state action 
doctrine purposes (an issue that remains an open one, see Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 
506 U.S. 139, 113 S. Ct. 684, 686 n. 1, 121 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1993), the PRMSA could be considered, consistent with the LGAA, a 
unique example of a special function governmental unit with an area of service congruent or coextensive with the boundaries of 
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, its creating jurisdiction. "
211,68," In Discussion Section II of this Report and Recommendation, infra, this court has determined that Tri-City Medical Center 
should be dismissed from this action as this court lacks personal jurisdiction over the medical center. However, if the district 
judge does not dismiss Tri-City Medical Center from this action, this court must address the medical center's argument that it 
should be dismissed from the action completely as, even if an injunction is issued against Tri-City Medical Center, the hospital 
cannot ""unilaterally determine the credentials of its Medical Staff."" Tri-City Medical Center's Reply Memorandum in Support of 
Motion to Dismiss, filed January 30, 1995, at p. 4 (emphasis in original). Tri-City Medical Center therefore contends that it is 
powerless to comply with an injunction issued against it, as its medical staff is responsible for the credentialing of its physicians, 
but, under California law, the medical staff is not employed by the hospital and so cannot be directed by it. Assuming that Tri-City Medical Center remains a party in this action and the court has jurisdiction over it, the Supremacy Clause 
drains the medical center's contention of its force. Under the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const., art. VI, cl. 2, a state statute can be 
preempted or superseded by federal law. Among state statutes thus subject to displacement are those which stand as an 
obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress. Ray v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 435 
U.S. 151, 55 L. Ed. 2d 179, 98 S. Ct. 988 (1978). Because Congress expressly authorized the federal courts to grant injunctive 
relief in furtherance of the purposes of federal antitrust law, federal law, including any final remedial or compensatory judgment 
of this court, will override any conflicting state law. Tri-City Medical Center also states that any injunction issued will not be enforceable against its medical staff, as the medical staff 
is not named as a party in this action. However, Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d) provides that an injunction may bind the ""parties to the 
action, their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and upon those persons in active concert or participation with 
them who receive actual notice of the order by personal service or otherwise."" Consonant with the language and purpose of Rule 65(d), an injunction may bind a non-party who acts on behalf of, or in concert 
with a named party. See Alemite Mfg. Corp. v. Staff, 42 F.2d 832, 833 (2d Cir. 1930) (""the only occasion when a person not a 
party may be punished, is when he has helped bring about, not merely what the decree has forbidden, because it may have 
gone too far, but what it has power to forbid, an act of a party""). As the medical staff of Tri-City acts, through its contract with the 
medical center, as the medical center's exclusive agent for purposes of credentialing the medical staff members, but not for 
other purposes, this significant relationship between Tri-City Medical Center and its medical staff should be sufficient to allow 
any injunction issued against the medical center to be binding upon the medical staff as its agent for this limited purpose or as 
persons acting in concert with Tri-City Medical Center regarding the question of which physicians will be permitted to practice 
within the hospital. "
212,," Moreover, as the nature and scope of any injunctive relief which could be issued by this court in the future is at this juncture, 
speculative, Tri-City Medical Center's assertion is premature and does not aid in making a determination regarding the medical 
center's motions to dismiss on grounds of immunity pursuant to the LGAA or lack of personal jurisdiction. For this reason also, it 
may be disregarded."

Section 2 of the Sherman Act."" Defendants' Joint Reply at 93 n. 50. This court has made no rulings regarding the merits of 
Plaintiffs' claims as to the Second Amended Complaint. If, when the court considers the pending Rule 12(b)(6) motions, the court 
should determine that Plaintiffs' have failed to demonstrate an actionable conspiracy as to all Defendants, at that time many of 
the hospital Defendants, assuming they remain as parties, could be dismissed from this suit. However, the decisions proposed in 
this Report and Recommendation, regarding the Defendants' jurisdictional motions, will not be affected by any future ruling on 
the motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), as the respective motions stand on distinct legal footings. Further, the cases cited by the Defendants in support of their argument against the application of Section 12 are not controlling. 
The portion of the Grosser v. Commodity Exchange, Inc., 639 F. Supp. 1293, 1315 (S.D.N.Y. 1986) cited by Defendants, 
Defendants' Joint Reply Memorandum at 93 n. 50, opinion is merely an alternative basis for decision with no explanation as to 
how the court came to its decision and is therefore dicta. Additionally, the court in Mylan Laboratories, Inc. v. Akzo, N.V., 1990 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3521, 1990 WL 58466 (D.D.C. 1990), discussed improper venue and transferred the case to another district 
without dismissing the conspiracy claims although ""the factual basis of plaintiff's claim [of conspiracy] was not significantly 
developed [in the record]."" Id. at *3. Mylan Laboratories therefore is not an example of a holding that, absent a showing of a 
prima facie antitrust conspiracy, an action should be dismissed pursuant to Sections 12 or 15 of the Clayton Act."

and the time that Johns Hopkins Hospital was served with the summons and complaint, as to which a waiver of service was 
returned executed on February 28, 1994. This contact with New York may therefore be considered in the determination of 
whether personal jurisdiction exists over Johns Hopkins Hospital. Compare Greene v. Sha-Na-Na, 637 F. Supp. 591, 595 
(D.Conn. 1986) (activities of a defendant subsequent to service of process of the complaint cannot form the basis of personal 
jurisdiction over the defendant)."

treatment of New York patients may be slightly different than those used to determine each hospital Defendant's overall

overall patient charges in determining the percentage of income derived from New York patients. Additionally, the figures 
provided have been rounded up or down to the nearest dollar. "

266,142," Several of the Defendant hospitals do not belong to CORD, as they do not maintain residency training programs in 
emergency medicine. See Footnote 133, supra. "
267,143," Plaintiffs argue that the RRC-EM requirement that physicians participate in professional organizations, and the fact that 
hospitals often pay for the expenses of the physicians, as well as permit them to use hospital time, office space, staff, and 
supplies, indicates that the physicians are acting as representatives or agents of the hospital in attending these professional 
meetings. Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law at V-110 - V-130. However, hospitals support and encourage affiliation with 
professional organizations in order to maintain their physicians' contact with new information and ideas in their fields, as well as 
participation in efforts to advance communication among physicians, resulting in the development and advancement of 
emergency medicine as a whole. Compare Menzie v. Windham Community Memorial Hospital, 774 F. Supp. 91, 97 (D.Conn. 
1991) (physicians may be considered agents or employees of a hospital for purposes of patient care); Vandervelde, supra, at 
156 (the individual defendants dominated the firms of which they were members and managed the clearing association as well; 
the nature of this relationship justified a finding that the participation of these dealers in association activities was an integral part 
of their employment in the industry, resulting in the court's finding that the actions of the individual defendants were within the 
scope of their authority, and, if the defendants were found liable, that liability could be imputed to their respective firms); Gilbert 
v. Sycamore Municipal Hospital, 156 Ill. 2d 511, 622 N.E.2d 788, 190 Ill. Dec. 758 (N.Y. 1993) (a hospital may be vicariously 
liable for the negligent acts of an emergency room physician under the doctrine of apparent authority). In this case it is clear that 
most of the medical staffs of the hospital Defendants are not employed by the hospitals, but by the medical schools with which 
they are affiliated, or by a separate physicians group which supplies services to the hospital. Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law, 
Appendix Volumes 12 and 13, Exhibits 1 - 26, Responses to Interrogatory No. 18. The authority of the emergency physicians to 
bind their respective hospitals is limited to the care they provide, see Menzie, supra, and Gilbert, supra; thus, it follows that 
conduct which occurs outside the hospital, even if it is required by the hospital, does not provide a basis upon which to impute a 
physician's conduct to the hospital. Plaintiffs' agency theory is continued by arguing that because the hospital Defendants condone, if not encourage, the 
participation of physicians in professional organizations, such participation is ""part of the job,"" and therefore, within the scope of 
employment. Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law at V-113. However, simply because an employer approves of a certain activities by 
an employee, such permission or support does not indicate that the conduct is considered a condition of the employment, rather, 
a hospital's encouragement in such matters is an investment in the continuing medical education of its physicians, which will 
lead ultimately to better performance of their duties. Further, a common industry practice of supporting outside activities does not 
show agency. "
268,144," In fact, CORD indicated that a shortage of residency trained, board certified emergency physicians exists. Plaintiffs' 
Memorandum of Law, Appendix Volume 2, Exhibit 3, Doc. No. C71. CORD subsequently established a task force to explore the 
issue of alternative training. C110, C113. The report of the committee which surveyed CORD members regarding alternative 
pathways to board eligibility summarized the results as follows: approximately 75% of those who responded opposed alternative 
pathways, 11% did not object to an alternative pathway, but did object to the specific proposal, see Plaintiffs' Memorandum of 
Law, Appendix Volume 2, Exhibit 3, Doc. Nos. C255-C256, C1065, as they believed it would lead to inadequate patient care, 
didactics i.e. teaching, and specialty service experience. Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law, Appendix Volume 2, Exhibit 3, Doc. 
Nos. C234, C247-C253, C958. CORD then adopted the position that it was not in favor of ""any alternative training routes being 
discussed at this time."" Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law, Appendix Volume 2, Exhibit 3, Doc. Nos. C659. CORD concluded that 
no emergency physician, regardless of board certification, need fear unemployment as each physician ""should be judged by his 
dedication, performance and compassion rather than his certificates,"" and that the lowering of standards for residency training 
and board eligibility would be unacceptable, as it would ""suggest that Emergency Medicine is not a specialty and not worthy of 
study."" Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law, Appendix Volume 2, Exhibit 3, Doc. Nos. C236-C237. Additionally, minutes from one of the CORD meetings indicate that ""relations between academics and practitioners, whether 
boarded [certified] or not, should be as equals. Evaluation of a physician should be on the basis of his performance."" Plaintiffs' 
Memorandum of Law, Appendix Volume 2, Exhibit 3, Doc. No. C235. Further, CORD stated that residency training has a ""format 
and defined curriculum that is equivalent at all programs,"" thus ensuring the adequacy of training and competency of residents in 
emergency medicine. Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law, Appendix Volume 2, Exhibit 3, Doc. No. C235."

residency training programs through the use of Residency Review Committees for each specialty. Thus, with respect to 
emergency medicine, the RRC-EM reviews the residency training programs of various hospitals and recommends them for 
accreditation to the ACGME."
269,147," CORD communicated with the RRC-EM with its special requirements for emergency medicine by submitting comments on 
the proposed changes. CORD suggested that the RRC-EM change its requirement that all faculty be certified by ABEM by 
allowing physicians additional time to become ABEM certified, and that RRC-EM remove the requirement of residency training. 
However, this suggestion was not adopted. Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law, Appendix Volume 2, Exhibit 3, C757, C760, C763, 
C772, C777. "
270,148," In fact, if, as Plaintiffs contend, the closure of the practice track raised the cost of emergency medicine physicians, the 
hospital Defendants would have no direct interest in increasing their costs; such an assertion is illogical and further 
demonstrates the lack of motive for any hospital Defendant to join the alleged conspiracy."
270,149," The Plaintiffs have not extended their argument to postulate that the hospital Defendants' adoption of or acquiescence to the 
RRC-EM's Special Requirements constituted conspiratorial behavior. See Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law at V-102 - V-110. 
However, even if such an assertion were established, there is an absence of evidence that the hospital Defendants benefitted 
from any monopoly power as the result of such behavior, and could not therefore be subjected to jurisdiction under such a 
theory. See Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law, Section V."
270,150," However, an exemption from the requirement of board certification exists for physicians who were practicing at the hospital at 
the time of the agreement to contract emergency medicine physician services, January 15, 1993. Plaintiffs' Memorandum of

conspiracy between these competitors. See, e.g., Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States, 306 U.S. 208, 221, 83 L. Ed. 610, 59 
S. Ct. 467 (1939). The idea behind this theory is that competitors' parallel business decisions are probative of the existence of a 
conspiracy between these competitors. To ensure that a court does not punish unilateral conduct, more than mere evidence of 
parallel conduct is required to support an inference of conspiracy; an agreement is properly inferred from conscious parallelism 
only when ""plus factors"" exist. Interstate Circuit, supra, at 222-23. "
276,153," If the district judge agrees that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a conspiracy by a preponderance of the evidence, the court 
need not further consider whether Plaintiffs have met their burden to also show an overt act, intentional participation, resulting 
injuries, and the other prerequisites for jurisdiction under Section 302(a)(2) enunciated in Chrysler Capital Corp., supra, and 
discussed below. "

specializing in emergency medicine who are ""board certified,"" and (b) that ABEM is presently the only entity available to provide 
such certification. "
281,156," Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center, Our Lady of Mercy Medical Center, and State University of New York at Stony 
Brook University Hospital indisputedly reside in New York and are thus irrelevant to this discussion. Further, Plaintiffs have not 
alleged any overt acts in New York that these instate Defendants committed in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy. "
283,157," As the Plaintiffs failed to make a sufficient showing of an antitrust conspiracy, the antitrust violations and injuries discussed in 
Section II (3) (a) of this Report and Recommendation should not be treated as injuries occurring in New York for purposes of 
considering personal jurisdiction under Section 302 (a) (3). Alternatively, should the District Judge find that an antitrust 
conspiracy for jurisdictional purposes has been made out, the antitrust injuries sustained by those Plaintiffs residing in New York 
at the time their application to ABEM were denied would satisfy the threshold requirement of injury for purposes of Section 302

no apparent reason to challenge the First Amended Complaint as to venue, as Dr. Daniel's state human rights law claim was at

the facts in this case were presented to a New York court, by applying Section 302(a)(1), it would reach the same result as did 
the court in Lanier. Thus, ABEM would be subject to personal jurisdiction for transacting business in New York under Section 
302. Regardless, as this court has already indicated, in its Report and Recommendation dated February 25, 1992, that ABEM

859 F.2d 148 (2d Cir. 1988), to establish that as Section 12's venue provision has not been satisfied, there can be no personal 
jurisdiction under Section 12. Defendants' Joint Reply Memorandum at p. 92. However, this particular holding was never 
appealed to the Second Circuit. The only matter considered by the Second Circuit in the Grosser case was Judge Lasker's 
Order of January 29, 1988, which adopted a plan for distribution of the proceeds of a pre-certification settlement. See Grosser 
and Greenberg Briefs to the Second Circuit, filed May 12, 1988, July 1, 1988, and August 9, 1988 (Docket No. 88 Civ. 7290). 
Further, this court has determined that the section's clause pertaining to venue should be read to be independent of the clause 
providing for service of process. See Discussion Section II(a), supra. Thus, the court does not find the reasoning in Grosser to 
be persuasive with respect to the requirements for establishing personal jurisdiction and venue under Section 12. Moreover, the 
reasoning in Grosser is too narrow to support the broad proposition Defendants advocate. The only holding reached in Grosser 
relevant to this case was that the defendant Mid-America Commodity Exchange had no measurable contacts with New York and 
hence transacted no business in the state sufficient to support long-arm jurisdiction under New York CPLR Section 302(a)(1). A 
fortiori, the court found the exchange did not transact any business of a substantial character upon which venue under Section 
12 could be based. Grosser does not address the issue present here. The question whether the nationwide service of process clause in Section 12 was conditioned upon satisfying the venue 
provision was addressed in Michelson v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 709 F. Supp. 1279 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) 
(Lasker, J.). There the court noted that the Second Circuit in Goldlawr, Inc. v. Heiman, 288 F.2d 579 (2d Cir. 1961), rev'd on 
other grounds, 369 U.S. 463, 8 L. Ed. 2d 39, 82 S. Ct. 913 (1962), stated that HN203[
] ""the extra territorial service privilege is given only when the other requirements [of Section 12] are satisfied."" Michelson, supra, at 1281. While acknowledging the 
persuasiveness of the reasoning in General Electric Co. v. Bucyrus-Erie Co., 550 F. Supp. 1037 (S.D.N.Y. 1982) (""the long 
sentence of which section 12 consists has two clauses, separated by a semicolon. One relates to venue, the other to service 
and, as noted, personal jurisdiction;"" the service provision of Section 12 is independent of Section 12's venue clause and is 
always available in antitrust cases), the court in Michelson nevertheless determined that as the Second Circuit ""might conclude "
301,," differently,"" the ""better course"" was to dismiss the complaint against the remaining defendants. It is reasonably clear that in 
Michelson the court's uncertainty as to the merits of the issue influenced the result. Moreover, it has been observed that the 
language, relied upon in Michelson and by Defendants, referred to in Goldlawr is dicta. Go-Video, 885 F.2d at 1411; Bucyrus-
Erie, Co., supra, at 1041. Further, later cases strongly support a contrary interpretation of Section 12, see Go-Video, supra; 
Leasco 468 F.2d at 1340, Mariash, 496 F.2d 1138; Kingsepp, 763 F. Supp. 22, an interpretation more consistent with the 
Clayton Act's legislative history as well. See Discussion Section II(a), supra. Accordingly, to the extent it can be said that 
Michelson supports the interpretation of Section 12 advanced by Defendants, for these reasons, this court declines to follow it. Defendants also contend that the Plaintiffs' application of Section 12 ""makes nonsense of the statute"" and ""strips venue of the 
protection it affords non-resident defendants."" Defendants' Joint Reply at 93. Defendants' argument begs the question of what 
the statute actually says and what ""protection"" Congress intended to provide defendants, particularly domestic corporations, 
through its venue requirements and overlooks precedent that the general venue statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1391, is supplementary to 
Section 12. Grosser, supra, at 313. King, 565 F. Supp. at 719 n. 11; Bucyrus-Erie Co., supra, at 1040-41. As discussed in 
Discussion Section II(a), supra, HN204[
] the venue and service of process clauses of Section 12 are not interdependent and therefore so long as venue is also available as to an antitrust defendant under either Section 12 of the Clayton Act or the general 
venue statute nationwide service of process is available. If as a result of later amendments in 1988 and 1990 to Section 1391, 
venue can be established as to a corporation based upon the availability of jurisdiction, effectively creating venue in any federal 
judicial district, that is a choice Congress has made, and one consistent with the broad remedial policies which prompted 
enactment of the Clayton Act. Congress is, of course, presumed to be aware of relevant law when it enacts legislation.  Cannon 
v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 696-97, 60 L. Ed. 2d 560, 99 S. Ct. 1946 (1979). There is therefore no reason as to

prosecution of federal antitrust claims. See Go-Video, supra, at 1410. "

no evidence in the record to support that allegation. "
348,7," In addition to the federal antitrust claims, Dr. Levine's complaint included the following: claims under Florida's antitrust statutes; 
a claim for tortious interference with business relations; a claim under Florida's general tort statute; and a claim for breach of 
contract. Dr. Levine filed a parallel suit in state court which has been held in abeyance pending resolution of this case in federal 
court."
348,8, Counts 1 through 3 also included Dr. Levine's state antitrust law claims.
348,9," Section 4 of the Clayton Act HN2[
] authorizes a private action for treble damages and provides, in pertinent part: ""Any 
person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor 
…."" 15 U.S.C.A. § 15(a) (West 1995). Section 16 authorizes a private action for injunctive relief, and provides, in pertinent part: 
HN3[
] ""Any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of the United States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws …."" 15 
U.S.C.A. § 26 (West 1973). "
349,10," Because we hold that Dr. Levine has failed to establish any antitrust violation, we also need not consider whether he has 
established standing to sue for injunctive relief under section 16 of the Clayton Act. "
350,11," Healthchoice charges each payor a nominal monthly fee for each of the payor's enrolled employees. In 1994, the fee was 
approximately $ 1.25 per month for each enrollee. Healthchoice has never earned a profit. "
351,12," ""Covered lives"" includes enrolled employees and any family members covered by their policy. The parties define ""the Orlando 
area"" as Orange, Seminole, and Osceola counties. "
352,13," We also note that in Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Soc'y, the Supreme Court implicitly sanctioned this approach to 
negotiating reimbursement rates: [A] binding assurance of complete insurance coverage--as well as most of the respondents' potential for lower insurance 
premiums--can be obtained only if the insurer and the doctor agree in advance on the maximum fee that the doctor will "
353,," accept as full payment for a particular service. Even if a fee schedule is therefore desirable, it is not necessary that the 
doctors do the price fixing…. Insurers are capable not only of fixing maximum reimbursable prices but also of obtaining 
binding agreements with providers guaranteeing the insured full reimbursement of a participating provider's fee."
353,457," U.S. 332, 352-53, 102 S. Ct. 2466, 2477-78, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48 (1982) (footnote omitted). "
354,14," For a discussion of market power, see infra pp. 776-78. "
355,15," For an explanation of how the fees are calculated, see supra pp. 769-70. "
356,16," Dr. Levine says that this patient stopped seeing him because she felt too guilty about his having waived the copayment 
requirement. That purported reason is somewhat ironic in view of Dr. Levine's income level. See supra p. 776."
356,17," Dr. Levine was required to define both the relevant product market and the relevant geographic market; however, because we 
have held that he failed to adequately define the relevant product market, we need not reach whether the Orlando area is a 
proper relevant geographic market. "
357,18," Because we hold that Dr. Levine has failed to establish any anticompetitive effect, we need not reach the second part of the 
rule of reason analysis and decide whether the defendants' conduct may be excused by some procompetitive benefit or 
justification. "
358,19," Section 2 provides that HN18[
] ""every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with 
any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, 
shall be deemed guilty of a felony."" 15 U.S.C.A. § 2 (West 1973). "
359,20," We also reject Dr. Levine's argument that the district court erroneously granted summary judgment against him on his state 
law antitrust claims. Florida's statute regulating combinations in restraint of trade provides: ""It is the intent of the Legislature that, 
in construing this chapter, due consideration and great weight be given to the interpretations of the federal courts relating to 
comparable federal antitrust statutes."" Fla.Stat.Ann. § 542.32 (West 1988); see also All Care Nursing Serv., Inc. v. Bethesda 
Memorial Hosp., Inc., 887 F.2d 1535, 1539 n. 1 (11th Cir.1989) (Tjoflat, J. concurring); Ad-Vantage Tel. Directory Consultants, 
Inc. v. GTE Directories Corp., 849 F.2d 1336, 1340 (11th Cir.1987) (""In applying this provision, the Florida courts held that the 
Florida legislature has, in effect, adopted as the law of Florida the body of anti-trust law developed by the federal courts under 
the Sherman Act. St. Petersburg Yacht Charters, Inc. v. Morgan Yacht, Inc., 457 So. 2d 1028 (Fla.App.1984). Thus, in analyzing 
this case, we may, and indeed must, apply the federal precedent developed under Section 2 of the Sherman Act.""). Therefore, 
the district court's grant of summary judgment on the state law antitrust claims was proper for the same reasons its grant of 
summary judgment on the federal antitrust claims was proper. "
364,1," This was not the only organization in which Vincent owned a share. He also owned 33% in the Heart Institute Cath Lab 
(""HICL"") and 27.55% in the Heart Institute Property (""HIP""). These organizations are collectively known as ""the medical 
practices."""
364,2," Since both plaintiffs filed identical briefs to this court, both will be hereafter referred to as ""Siragusa."" "
365,3, Malley-Duff did not reach this issue.  483 U.S. at 156-57. 
366,4," Siragusa does not argue that the panel should adopt the ""last predicate act"" rule. "
373,1," That policy was in two part. Coverage ""A"" applied to claims above the limits on the underlying commercial general liability 
policy written by Employers Insurance of Wausau (Wausau). In its brief supporting its motion  [*4] for judgment on the pleadings 
filed November 15, 1995, Heileman stipulates that the Wausau policy does not cover the claims presented to Federal and so the 
question before the Court is whether coverage ""B"" of the Federal policy provides coverage. "
374,2," Where, as here, the Indiana courts have not yet considered the precise issue presented, this Court's task is to predict how the 
Indiana Supreme Court would resolve the issue. Equitable Life Assurance Soc'y of the United States v. Bell, 27 F.3d 1274, 1277 
(7th Cir 1994). ""In making this decision, the Court is aided by the interpretations of other courts construing similar...clauses in 
analogous insurance policies. While these opinions are instructive, this Court must be guided by general rules of contract 
interpretation applicable in Indiana."" Equitable Life Assurance Soc'y of the United States v. Bell, 818 F. Supp. 245, 249 (N.D. Ind 
1993) aff'd, 27 F.3d 1274 (7th Cir. 1994). "
375,3," Had Federal intended to limit coverage under the ""personal injury"" section to natural persons as opposed to business 
corporations, it could have easily done so just as it did under the ""BODILY INJURY"" section by limiting bodily injury to ""injury 
sustained by any person."" (Policy, p. 15)."
375,4," As a linguistic matter, this appears to make little sense. In Pipefitters Welfare Educ. Fund v. Westchester Fire, 976 F.2d 1037, 
1042 (7th Cir. 1992), the Seventh Circuit pointed out the obvious anomaly writing: ""We acknowledge that our holding, which 
affords  [*11] personal injury coverage for an economic harm to a business might appear odd."" Because the parties did not 
argue the matter on appeal, the argument was waived and thus the court was ""in no position to say anything about its merits."" "
377,5," In an even more attenuated effort to equate ""price discrimination"" with ""discrimination,"" Heileman points to the Bluebook's 
(Harvard's Uniform System of Citation) description of the phrase ""see also. "" Under section 1.2(a), as Heileman points out, ""see 
also"" means that the ""cited authority constitutes additional source material that supports the proposition."" (Italics in original). It is 
important to note, however,  [*17] that the cited material ""supports"" the proposition, not that it ""clearly states the proposition"" in 
which case, under section 1.2(a) no signal would be used. Moreover, in the schema of ""supporting"" signals, ""see also"" is fifth out 
of six signals and according to section 1.3 the signals in section 1.2 are listed in descending order of prominence."
377,6," In its reply brief, Heileman argues that because there is a specific endorsement removing employment related discrimination 
from the policy, this is evidence that ""price discrimination"" was meant to be covered. On this score, Heileman argues that ""apart 
from employment a business like Heileman has little if any risk of liability for discrimination excepting price discrimination."" (Rec. 
39, p. 3). Thus, unless coverage attaches in cases like this, Federal's policy relating to claims of discrimination would be a ""sham 
unless price discrimination is covered."" (Id.). Presumably, however,  [*18] Federal's policy would cover typical discrimination 
claims (e.g. race, sex, national origin, age and the like) where made by non-employees such as distributors or customers. Thus, 
it does not follow that if ""price discrimination"" does not fit within the ambit of ""discrimination"" Federal's coverage for 
discrimination claims is illusory."
377,7," Part of the reason for placing the burden of proving that a claim falls within an exclusion or exception on the shoulders of the 
insurer is because ""the insured's intent in purchasing an insurance policy is to obtain coverage, therefore any ambiguity 
jeopardizing such coverage should be construed consistent with the insured's intent "" Hurst-Rosche, supra 51 F.3d at 1342. The 
notion that an insured's intent in purchasing a policy is of key concern in construing coverage raises an interesting question in 
this case. It seems almost unthinkable that in purchasing the umbrella coverage from Federal, Heileman thought that it was 
getting protection for any claims arising from price discrimination. If that were the case, Heileman could, as a corporate matter, 
decide to purchase a policy like the one issued in this case and then intentionally do that which is alleged in the Calumet lawsuit 
knowing that if anyone challenged them they could turn to  [*20] Federal for compensation. It is highly doubtful that this was ever 
in the contemplation of Heileman when it purchased the policy just as it is highly doubtful that Federal ever issued the policy 
thinking it was insuring against a price discrimination claim. "
378,8," In its brief, Heileman argues that Federal's use of a semicolon means ""and."" As support for that proposition, Heileman cites 
Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary (1988 ed.) which defines ""semicolon"" as ""a punctuation mark; used chiefly in a 
coordinating function between major sentence elements (as independent clauses of a compound sentence)."" (Rec. 24, p. 13). 
That definition actually supports the notion that the exceptions are to be read in the disjunctive because separated as they are 
by a semicolon, they are independent clauses of a compound sentence with the semicolon serving as a ""coordinating function."" "
400,1," The United Center also hosts other one-time or exclusive events, such as the circus, music concerts, college basketball games 
and others. (Id. at P 10.)"
400,2," Plaintiffs claim that every other sports stadium in Chicago allows patrons to bring peanuts purchased from outside vendors into 
the stadium. (Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Support of Motion for Preliminary Injunction (hereinafter ""Support Memo""), at 19; 
Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunctive Relief (hereinafter ""Motion"") P 59.) They assert, further, that twenty-two of the 
National Hockey League stadiums in the United States and Canada have no such ban on patrons bringing peanuts into the 
stadium. (Support Memo. at 21.)"
400,3," Vendors allege that they purchase hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of peanuts from these Chicago-area wholesalers, 
who import them from other states. (Complaint at P 6.)"
400,4," Vendors allege that peanuts are sold to customers from several states, including Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Iowa. 
(Complaint at P 26.)"
400,5," Vendors assert that sales of peanuts last year (apparently 1994) exceeded $ 500,000. (Id. at P 20.) "
403,6," The United Center itself was opened for the first time in 1994. To the extent vendors rely on the old Chicago Stadium's history 
of non-enforcement of any ""no-outside-food policy"" as evidence of a ""long-standing"" joint marketing arrangement, this court is 
not persuaded. Simple neglect to enforce a food ban--or even the absence of such a ban--does not constitute a cooperative 
effort between stadium owners and the Vendors."
403,7," Plaintiff in Aspen argued that the jury verdict might be upheld under the ""essential facilities"" theory, as well, but the Court found 
it unnecessary to consider that theory. 472 U.S. at 611 n. 44. "
404,8," The Seventh Circuit has recently cautioned, however, the ""essential facilities"" cases have ""been criticized as having nothing to 
do with the purposes of antitrust law."" Blue Cross & Blue Shield United v. Marshfield Clinic, 65 F.3d 1406, 1412 (7th Cir. 1995)."
404,9," In their Complaint, Vendors alleged two relevant product markets: (1) sale of snack food concessions at the United Center; and 
(2) sale of snack foods on public sidewalks outside of sports stadiums. (Complaint PP 11, 21.) They also alleged two relevant 
geographic markets: (1) outside virtually every sports stadium in the United States; and (2) both inside and outside the United 
Center. (Complaint PP 11, 21, 53, 60.) In their reply memorandum, Vendors state: ""To be clear on this matter, Plaintiffs contend 
that the market at issue in this case is the market for food concessions in and around the United Center."" (Reply Memo, at 12) 
(emphasis added by Vendors). "
406,10," Defendant has objected to the court's consideration of Plaintiffs' Supplementary Memorandum in Response to the Court's 
Request for Additional Authority on the ground that the court did not grant Plaintiffs leave to file it but instead specifically 
requested that the parties simply provide relevant citations. (Letter of Attorney Voeks to the court, 11/14/95.) The court has 
declined to consider arguments made only in Plaintiffs' Supplementary Memorandum, but will briefly address the five cited 
cases."
406,11," The court notes, however, that given Vendors' estimate that their sales have been reduced to one-fifth, it would appear that 
the means do exist to calculate lost profits. "
407,12," The court recognizes that whether or not Defendant bans patrons from bringing food into the United Center, Defendant will 
have a captive audience for concession sales. Even customers inclined to purchase peanuts outside the Center for consumption 
inside might want snacks or beverages later in the game, and are not likely to leave the facility to make such purchases. In light 
of the evidence that Vendors' own sales have declined precipitously the court assumes, however, that the no-outside-food ban 
does boost United Center's snack sales."
407,13," The song refers, of course, to baseball, not to basketball or hockey. "
411,1," These school districts are located in the following seventeen counties: Crittenden, Trigg, Union, Henderson, Webster, Hopkins, 
Christian, Todd, McLean, Daviess, Muhlenberg, Ohio, Butler, Simpson, Grayson, and Breckinridge. These counties are referred 
to collectively as the West-2 submarket. Plaintiff's expert report includes Caldwell County in the West-2 submarket, as well."
411,2," These school districts are located in the following eleven counties: Ballard, Carlisle, Hickman, Fulton, Graves, McCracken, 
Calloway, Marshall, Livingston, Lyon and Carlisle. These counties are referred to collectively as the West-1 submarket. "
420,1," The Class consists primarily of retail pharmacies and drug stores which, at any time during the period from October 15, 1989, 
to the present, purchased prescription brand name drugs directly from any of the defendants."
420,2," As defined in P 3(h) of the Consolidated and Amended Class Action Complaint (""Complaint""), ""Prescription Brand Name 
Drugs"" are ""drugs that are sold under the brand name of the Manufacturer rather than the drug's generic name."""
420,3," Under the chargeback system, a manufacturer would contract with its end use customer and establish a price with that 
customer. The manufacturer would then provide the wholesaler involved in the transaction with a chargeback for the difference 
between what the wholesaler paid and what the discounted price was with the end user. "
421,4," DuPont Merck's Board of Directors includes three representatives from Merck and DuPont, respectively. As of the formation of 
the joint venture, DuPont contributed the entirety of its pharmaceutical business, including its drug portfolio, to the joint venture, 
and no longer participated in such business on its own. Merck contributed expertise in the pharmaceutical industry, rights to 
certain products and financial backing to the joint venture. "
424,5," The PACE Alliance is a retail buying group with over 4,000 members. "
425,6," Class Plaintiffs state that the experiment's failure is not attributable to plaintiffs' inability to affect market shares. Rather, the 
Class ascribes the failure of the experiment to DuPont Merck's refusal to offer a competitive price."
425,7," The Class' argument that DuPont Merck participated in the industry ""conspiracy"" to tie price increases to the Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) is unavailing. As DuPont Merck properly points out, when it first announced its Single Price Policy effective January 
1, 1991, it also announced in the same public document that it was adopting a policy to keep prices in line with inflation. There is 
nothing in the record tending to show that DuPont Merck's inflation based policy was not independently formulated and adopted. 
The Class' evidence of industry discussions regarding tying price increases to the CPI, which culminated in the Pharmaceutical 
Manufacturer Association's request to the Justice Department for a Business Review, came well after DuPont Merck formulated 
and adopted its own policy. "

JIB Mem. of Law, at 4 n.4. "
437,5," That the other defendants apparently do not contest the Fund's standing does not absolve plaintiffs from their duty to respond 
to the argument made by Local 3. Moreover, standing is an Article III ""case or controversy"" limitation to subject matter

Marone Aff., P 5; Reilly Aff., PP 3; Zarrelli Aff., PP 3, 4. The application of this rule to a statement made by an employee of a 
non-party contractor which in turn is a member of one the defendant Associationsis not as clear. See, e.g., Dello Russo Aff., P 5. "
441,8," Plaintiffs also argue in their motion papers that defendants have illegally funded the JIB in violation of § 302 of the Labor 
Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. § 186. While a violation of 29 U.S.C. § 186 would be a predicate act under RICO, the 
court finds that, even if these allegations were properly pleaded in the complaint, they would not state a claim under this statute. In general, HN9[
]  29 U.S.C. § 186 makes it unlawful for an employer or association of employers to make any payments to a labor organization. Even assuming that JIB is a labor organization, however--a fact it contests--payments made by NYECA and 
AECI would not be unlawful. Under 29 U.S.C. § 186(c)(9), payments to a joint-labor management committee such as JIB are 
permissible. See BASF Wyandotte Corp. v. Local 227, Int'l Chemical Workers Union, 791 F.2d 1046, 1053 (2d Cir. 1986). 
Plaintiff's allegations concerning violations of this statute are therefore fatally defective."
441,9," Plaintiffs also contend that JIB has conducted a systematic campaign to harass them through the filing of litigation and 
administrative complaints. These activities, however, are entirely legitimate, and, even if meritless, cannot be said to constitute 
either extortion under N.Y. Penal Law § 155.05(e) or interference with commerce in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951. Both these 
statutes require that the defendant threaten force or violence or instill fear in the plaintiff. The filing of a meritless lawsuit or 
administrative action, even if for the purpose of harassment, does not involve a threat of force, violence or fear. See Park South 
Assoc. v. Fischbein, 626 F. Supp. 1108, 1114 (S.D.N.Y. 1986) (dismissing RICO action based upon Hobbs Act and state law 
extortion through allegedly meritless litigation). "
443,10," To the extent that Scotto held that a person may be liable under RICO simply because the requisite nexus exists between his 
activity and the affairs of the enterprise, it was overruled by the Supreme Court's decision in Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 
170, 113 S. Ct. 1163, 122 L. Ed. 2d 525 (1993), holding that a person must be involved in the ""operation or management"" of an 
enterprise to be liable under RICO. See United States v. Napoli, 45 F.3d 680 (2d Cir. 1995); United States v. Viola, 35 F.3d 37 "
444,," (2d Cir. 1994). To the extent that Scotto held that a person cannot be liable under RICO unless there is a sufficient nexus 
between his racketeering activity and the enterprise, it remains good law, as evidenced by the Second Circuit's use of language 
derived from the Scotto opinion in Thai, a post-Reves decision."
444,11, See discussion supra note 8 
447,12," The relevant provisions of HN16[
] Section 158(b)(4) make it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents: (I) to engage in, or to induce or encourage any individual employed by any person engaged in commerce or in an industry 
affecting commerce to engage in, a strike or a refusal in the course of his employment to use, manufacture, process, 
transport, or otherwise handle or work on any goods, articles, materials or commodities or to perform any services; or (ii) to

449,13," In Count Eight of the Second Amended Complaint, P 83, plaintiffs assert that their claims rest upon the allegations contained 
in paragraphs 22, 23, 25(a) (h)-(j) and 26(a)(c)-(h) and (j). Because there are no sub-sections of paragraph 26 beyond (d), this is 
clearly an error. Moreover, some of the affidavits upon which plaintiffs purport to rely to support their state law claims, Pl.'s Mem. 
of Law, at 100, correspond to paragraphs in the complaint that are not specifically listed in Count Eight. Compare, e.g., Zarrelli 
Aff. with P 25(u); Corso Aff. with P 25(t). Having dismissed all claims accruing before June 18, 1990, the court leaves it to the 
plaintiffs to correct these errors."
449,14," Although this affidavit relies upon hearsay, the declarant, Patrick Ciccone, was deposed in this action. Thus, the affidavit may 
be considered because it is corroborated by evidence admissible at trial. See Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse v. Esprit de 
Corp., 769 F.2d 919, 924 (2d Cir. 1985)."

471,1," Plaintiff's allegations regarding HIP's status as the largest HMO in the New York metropolitan area are also irrelevant for 
purposes of determining HIP's monopoly power. As the Seventh Circuit recently decided in Blue Cross & Blue Shield v. 
Marshfield Clinic, 65 F.3d 1406, 1409 (7th Cir. 1995), HMOs do not constitute a ""market separate from other contractual forms in 
which … physicians sells their services."" Rather, HMOs compete in a broader market with ""various types of fee-for-service 
provider."" Id. "
482,1, This action is before the Magistrate Judge upon consent of the parties. (Docket Entry No. 18). 
484,2," HN2[
] Upon a motion for summary judgment the factual contentions are viewed in the light most favorable to the party 
opposing the motion for summary judgment. Duchon v. Cajon Co., 791 F.2d 43, 46 (6th Cir. 1986) app. 840 F.2d 16 (6th Cir. 
1988) (unpublished opinion). As will be discussed infra, under Supreme Court holdings, upon the filing of a motion for summary 
judgment, the opposing party must come forth with sufficient evidence to withstand a motion for a directed verdict, Anderson v. 
Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 247-52, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986), particularly where there has been an opportunity 
for discovery.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265, 276 (1986). For the purposes of this 
motion, the defendants assume Ford's evidence to be true, but argue that her proof on her antitrust claims cannot support a 
judgment under Supreme Court and Sixth Circuit precedents. Otherwise, the parties' respective views of the evidence on the 
relevant geographical and product markets would present significant factual disputes. In essence, the defendants challenge the 
legal sufficiency of Ford's proof, and thus, unless specifically noted, this section does not represent findings of fact within the 
meaning of Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d). "

485,5," It is undisputed that within a radius of 150 miles from Nashville, the number of radiation oncologists increased to 36 in 1994 
from three in 1974. (Docket Entry No. 57 at p. 4). "
486,6," Pisarkiewicz's exclusion of the Maury and Montgomery counties as well as the Bowling Green facilities from the relevant 
geographic market is consistent with the NMH data base for patients. NMH's records of its actual patients reflect their residences 
in Sumner, Robinson, Williamson, Rutherford, Wilson, Macon, Cheatham, Humphreys, Dickson, Jackson, Trousdale and 
Madison counties. (Docket Entry No. 73. Anderson Deposition at Exhibit A thereto). "
487,7," Pisarkiewicz, likewise discredits the state hospital reports on the number of patients as ""nonsensical"" and erroneous. (Docket 
Entry No. 51, Pisarkiewicz deposition, Exhibit 1 at p. 9)."
487,8," The number of radiation oncologists within an approximately 150 mile radius of Nashville increased from 3 in 1974 to 36 in 
1994. (Docket Entry No. 46, Stroup affidavit at P 11). "
493,9," The defendants observe that this market definition excludes competing radiation oncologists who perform services at free-
standing clinics."
493,10," The extent of VUMC's advertising is challenged (Docket Entry No. 51, Pisarkiewicz deposition at Exhibit 2, p. 5), but there is 
no evidence to challenge the fact that VUMC does advertise. "
495,11," Such future conduct by Stroup and ROA to exclude Ford from these medical staffs could give rise to an independent claim 
under state law. See Quality Auto Parts Co., Inc. v. Bluff City Buick Co., Inc., 876 S.W.2d 818, 822-24 (Tenn. 1994). As 
discussed later, such acts also could serve as predicate acts for another attempt to monopolize action under the Sherman Act. "

501,1," Kodak may have been misled by a line of cases finding dissolution and divestiture to be unavailable to private litigants under § 
16. International Tel. and Tel. Corp. v. General Tel. & Electronics Corp., 518 F.2d 913, 922 (9th Cir. 1975). In California v. 
American Stores Co. 495 U.S. 271, 283, 109 L. Ed. 2d 240, 110 S. Ct. 1853 (1990), the Court held that § 16 does in fact 
authorize divestiture as a remedy for private litigants, thereby overruling International Tel. and Tel.. Thus, even if the availability 
of divestiture as a remedy were somehow relevant to the instant case, which it is not, this ground for differentiating between 
public and private antitrust actions no longer exists. "
502,2," ""ISO,"" as used herein, refers, to independent service organizations, such as plaintiffs."
502,3," Kodak's reliance on Hartford-Empire Co. v. United States, 323 U.S. 386, 89 L. Ed. 322, 65 S. Ct. 373 (1945), supplemented, 
324 U.S. 570 (1945), is misplaced. The Court plainly acknowledged in that case ""this is not to say that a decree need deal only 
with the exact type of acts found to have been committed or that the court . . may not prohibit acts which in another setting would 
be unobjectionable."" Id. at 409. Nor does In re Multidistrict Vehicle Air Pollution, 538 F.2d 231 (9th Cir. 1976), help Kodak. The injury in the instant case is 
undeniably harm to the competitive market system, which the antitrust laws were designed to protect. In contrast, the harm to be 
alleviated in Multidistrict Vehicle Air Pollution was environmental, not economic, id. at 236; thus, that case is inapplicable."
502,4," It is inapposite that these cases involve patent misuse whereas there has been no finding of patent misuse in the instant case. 
Even without a specific finding of patent misuse, it is within the court's ""large discretion,"" in fashioning a remedy for Kodak's § 2 
violation, to enjoin Kodak's otherwise permissible refusal to sell protected parts. Loew's Inc., 371 U.S. at 53; United States

entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265, 106 S.

the nonmoving party. Otteson v. United States, 622 F.2d 516, 519 (10th Cir. 1980). "
510,2," As Defendants' expert economist, George F. Rhodes, Ph.D., states: The relevant geographic market including the Laidlaw landfill and the Horst property consists of the geographic areas 
served by the haulers using the BFI landfills at Tower Road and RPS, the transfer station owned and operated by Waste 
Management (WMX) in Commerce City together with the landfills serving it. Rhodes Report, April 13, 1995, at 2; see also id. at 12-15."
510,3, Excludes WMI landfill at Commerce City. 
511,4, Includes WMI landfill at Commerce City.
511,5," Plaintiffs' Exhibit A states that ""there are currently four MSW [municipal sanitary waste] landfills serving the market: 2 owned by 
BFI, one by LWS [Laidlaw] and one controlled by WMI."" Although the document also refers to the ""northern Denver metropolitan 
market,"" the description of this market includes the City and County of Denver and the entire 1.9 million person population of the 
Denver metropolitan area. See also Daniel R. Horst Deposition, April 26, 1995, at 28-29 (the waste deposited in each of the four 
operating landfills ""comes from the entire Denver Metropolitan area and the outlying suburbs""). "
512,6," Note, even if I were to accept for purposes of summary judgment Dr. Peseau's amended opinion that the relevant market 
excludes WMI, my ultimate conclusion that Defendants had no dangerous probability of obtaining monopoly power would not 
change. See note 7, infra."
512,7," Similarly, even if the Court were to use the narrower, three-landfill relevant market advanced by plaintiffs, plaintiffs' own 
numbers indicate that Laidlaw's market share declined from 55-59% in 1991 to 36-41% in 1992, or approximately one-third. See 
Exhibit C of Peseau letter, May 31, 1995. "
513,8," Given this disposition, the Court need not consider Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, wherein Defendants assert that Plaintiffs' 
complaint suffers from numerous pleading defects. "
524,1," Advance owns 24 other newspapers, none of which are defendants in the instant action. "
525,2," As noted infra p. 10, the Court granted defendant the Lexington Herald-Leader's motion for summary judgment nearly a year 
ago. On May 19, 1995, pursuant to a joint motion of AD/SAT and defendant Baltimore Sun, this Court issued an Order 
dismissing the Baltimore Sun from this action with prejudice."
525,3," Under the rate card effective prior to the filing of the instant motion, which had been in effect since August 1991, if an advertiser 
wishes to send a single ad to a single paper on the same day, the fee is $ 90. The best possible price per advertisement is $ 
11.70, which applies if the advertiser wishes to have the ad delivered to 76 or more newspapers. However, as will be discussed 
infra p. 19-20, in recent years AD/SAT has often worked out special rates for its larger customers. "
526,4," The ad is actually first transmitted to AP's technical center in Cranbury, New Jersey, which is the AP AdSEND Hub. AP's 
central computer then checks to ensure that there have been no transmission errors, and sends the ad to the newspapers. "
527,5," In the appropriate case, market definition may be decided on summary judgment. See Belfiore v. New York Times Co., 826 
F.2d 177, 180-81 (2d Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1067, 98 L. Ed. 2d 994, 108 S. Ct. 1030 (1988). "
528,6," Actually, AD/SAT's complaint alleges that the transmission of ads to newspapers is a relevant market, and that the electronic 
transmission of ads is the relevant submarket in this case. The Supreme Court has stated that within broad product markets 
""well defined submarkets may exists which, in themselves, constitute product markets for antitrust purposes."" Brown Shoe Co. v. 
United States, 370 U.S. 294, 325, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510, 82 S. Ct. 1502 (1962). The required analysis does not change whether a 
particular product market is deemed a market or a submarket. See H.J., Inc. v. International Tel. & Tel. Corp., 867 F.2d 1531, 
1540 (8th Cir. 1989) (""The same proof which establishes the existence of a relevant product market also shows . . . the 
existence of a product submarket.""). Academic commentators have argued that the use of the term submarket draws no 
meaningful distinction, and only serves to create confusion. See 2A Phillip E. Areeda et al., Antitrust Law, P533 (1995). The 
Court agrees, and restricts itself to use of the term ""market""."
528,7," AP internal documents reveal that AP officers, when stating they hoped to ""capture"" the market, often were referring to the 
electronic delivery market. For antitrust purposes, however, the relevant market is determined by reasonable interchangeability, 
as evidenced by cross-elasticity of demand and supply, not by laymen's comments made in a competitive business environment. 
See Nobel Scientific Indus. v. Beckman Instruments, 670 F. Supp. 1313, 1318-19 (D. Md. 1986), aff'd, 831 F.2d 537, 538 (4th 
Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 487 U.S. 1226, 101 L. Ed. 2d 920, 108 S. Ct. 2886 (1988). "
529,8, Exhibits are identified as PX for plaintiff's exhibit and DX for defendants' exhibit.
529,9," A marketing study prepared in March 1994 for AP by Clark, Martire & Bartolomeo, Inc. found that 84% of advertisements were 
delivered by overnight services. See Affidavit of Hillary Lane, Esq. Ex. 115 at 9. See also Affidavit of Almarin Phillips in Support 
of Summary Judgment (""Phillips Aff."") at P 13. "
530,10," Following AD/SAT's reasoning, because AP's rush service delivers ads in one hour, and AD/SAT's rush service takes three 
hours, it appears that the Court would be compelled to treat each of these as separate market. "
531,11," Paragraph 23 of the First Amended Complaint states: At present, the market for the transmission of newspaper advertising, as well as the electronic transmission submarket 
thereof, is characterized by low concentration, vigorous competition, rapid technological development, and ease of entry 
relative to the three other relevant markets, in which Associated Press occupies a monopoly position. Up to the time of the 
announcement by Associated Press of its intention to enter the transmission market, newspapers have acted according to 
their interest in receiving the best possible product at the lowest possible price, and have entered into no arrangements or 
agreements to foreclose competition on the merits by competitors in the transmission market and the electronic 
transmission submarket. Setting aside the merits of AD/SAT's conspiracy argument contained in this paragraph, which will be discussed infra part V.A., 
AD/SAT concedes that barriers to entry are low."
531,12," AD/SAT's arguments in support of its attempted monopolization claim, as they must, do not attempt to establish that there is a 
reasonable likelihood of monopolization of the market defined by the Court, but rather assumes a market restricted to electronic 
delivery. See Pl's. Opp. at 80."
531,13," It is true that both AP and AD/SAT view electronic delivery as the wave of the future. And, AP's own records indicate that it 
expects to achieve deep market penetration among larger-volume advertisers. See PX 175. However, a firm's market share is 
measured ""when it undertakes the challenged anticompetitive conduct."" Walsh Trucking, 812 F.2d at 791. Therefore, standing 
alone, AD/SAT's reliance on AP's projected market share is not persuasive evidence. "
534,14," The Court notes in passing that AP contends that, even if cost of capital is considered, AdSEND is not priced below cost. Dr. 
Comanor concluded that AdSEND was priced below cost upon finding that the program's cost of capital, between 19% and 24%, 
was higher than its projected internal rate of return (""IRR"") of 16.5%. However, in determining the IRR, Dr. Comanor presumed 
that after a five year period the AdSEND program would have ""no residual value remaining."" See Comanor Aff. P 12. In so 
doing, he followed the five-year planning period developed in AP's business plan. See PX 211. However, ""most, if not all, finance 
textbooks . . . state that a continuing value should be included in the calculation of IRR's."" Phillips Aff. P 7 (citing Brealey & 
Myers, Principles of Corporate Finance 96 4th ed. (1991) and Copeland et al., Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of 
Companies 207 (1990)). Because the issue is not clear, the Court will not resolve whether Dr. Comanor or Dr. Phillips is correct. 
However, assuming Dr. Comanor is correct, meaning that AdSEND is priced below cost, the Court notes that his conclusion 
depends upon AdSEND having no value in five years. Given this, the Court views with even more skepticism AD/SAT's assertion 
that there is a dangerous probability that AP could recoup the losses it suffered in predatorily pricing AdSEND. "
535,15," In its First Amended Complaint AD/SAT also alleges that AP leveraged its monopoly power in the satellite transmission 
newspaper services market to gain advantage in the electronic delivery of advertisements market. See id. However, in its 
memorandum of law in opposition to summary judgment, this allegation is not discussed. See Pl's. Opp. at 59-62. Therefore, the 
Court deems it waived."
535,16," It has been suggested by academic commentators that, after the Supreme Court decisions in Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image 
Technical Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265, 112 S. Ct. 2072 (1992), and Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 
U.S. 447, 122 L. Ed. 2d 247, 113 S. Ct. 884 (1993), monopolization or a dangerous threat of monopolization of the second 
market is necessary for a monopoly leveraging claim to succeed. See International Audiotext Network v. American Tel. & Tel. 
Co., 893 F. Supp. 1207, 1212 n.4 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) (citing Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, P 626.1 
(Supp. 1993)). However, the District Courts of the Second Circuit continue to follow Berkey Photo."
535,17," For a discussion of numbers two and six, which are based on conspiracy allegations, see infra part V. For a discussion of 
number seven, which deals with the allegedly premature announcement of AdSEND, see supra part II.B.1. "
536,18," Although not presented as such, the Court interprets AD/SAT's claim that AP is charging it monopoly prices for the use and 
maintenance of the AP owned satellite system as also one for monopoly leveraging. This conclusion follows from AD/SAT's 
argument that in order to compete in the electronic ad delivery market a business ""must either gain access to the network, for 
which AP is charging monopoly prices when it allows access at all, or incur substantial expense to create duplicate facilities, 
which will then be used to solicit the business of the very newspapers that own the AP satellite network."" Pl's. Opp. at 81-82. AP 
charges AD/SAT $ 730,000 annually for the use of its satellite, while charging itself $ 75,000. AD/SAT's argument fails for 
several reasons. First, AD/SAT provides no evidence that AP has a monopoly in the satellite market. Therefore, because HN16[ ] the exercise of monopoly power is necessary to sustain a monopoly leveraging claim, see Berkey Photo, 603 F.2d at 284, AD/SAT's must fail. Second, AP is providing access to its satellite system. While AD/SAT claims that access is afforded only by 
paying monopoly prices, the Court notes that the contracts governing this relationship between AD/SAT and AP were first 
entered into in 1986, and were favorably renegotiated by AD/SAT in 1991. Thus, absent evidence of an actual monopoly in the 
satellite market, the Court assumes that the price AP charges AD/SAT for use of its satellite network is the market rate. Finally, 
even if the prices AP charges AD/SAT to use its satellite network were the exercise of monopoly power, because the relevant 
market in this case is the delivery of newspaper advertisements by any means, AD/SAT's monopoly leveraging claims still must 
fail. It is simply not necessary either to gain access to AP'S network, or to build duplicate facilities, in order to compete in this 
market. See Ortho Diagnostic, 822 F. Supp. at 153 HN17[
] (""monopoly leveraging is where a party uses its monopoly power in 
one market to distort or affect competition in another market."") (emphasis added). "
537,19," Assuming this argument succeeds, AD/SAT asserts that the liability of NAA and the newspaper defendant turns upon whether 
they participated in or ratified the AdSEND program. See Pl's. Opp at 52. "
538,20," Typically, § 1 cases are analyzed under the rule of reason, which requires the factfinder ""to weigh all the circumstances of a 
case in deciding whether a restrictive practice should be prohibited as imposing an unreasonable restraint on competition."" 
Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 49, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977). In a limited number of 
cases, conduct which is so plainly harmful to competition will be declared per se illegal. See id. at 49-50. Examples of per se 
illegality include horizontal and vertical price fixing, the division of a market into territories, certain tying arrangements, and some 
group boycotts involving concerted refusals to deal with a competitor. See Capital Imaging, 996 F.2d at 542-43 (citing cases). "
539,21," Because liability for conspiracy requires an agreement between at least two distinct economic entities, see supra p. 43, the 
Court need not, and does not, separately review AP's conduct to see if it had a motive to conspire. That is, even if AP had a 
motivation to conspire, because the Court finds that no other defendant had a rational motivation to conspire, necessarily AP has 
no potential co-conspirators. Therefore, AP's conduct with respect to the conspiracy claims is only discussed as it relates to 
other defendants."
539,22," In fact, AD/SAT appears to state that the purpose of the illegal agreement is to create a monopoly for AdSEND so that AP can 
earn monopoly profits, and pass these profits to the papers by way of reducing membership dues. See Pl's. Opp. at 70. While a 
§ 2 conspiracy does require monopolization of the market as a goal, because § 1 only requires an adverse effect on competition, 
see Capital Imaging, 996 F.2d at 543, the Court assumes AD/SAT's theory, as applied to its § 1 claim, is so limited. "
540,23," AD/SAT criticized this Court's Opinion and Order granting summary judgment to the Lexington Herald-Leader because it failed 
to acknowledge evidence intended to prove that the papers believed it rational to help AP achieve a monopoly. Specifically, 
AD/SAT presented a statement apparently made by Jerry Tillis, a vice president of marketing for Knight-Ridder, that because 
current delivery services, including AD/SAT, were in disarray, there was a great opportunity for AP to enter the market, and by 
so doing it could mean a major offset in the AP dues structure. See PX 25. This evidence is not probative. First, it amounts to 
nothing more than encouragement for a new competitor to enter the ad delivery market, which is in the interest of all newspapers 
and is conduct the antitrust laws are designed to protect. It is true that AP papers may have a special interest in AP making a 
successful entry into the market. However, because papers survive based upon generating profits, not decreasing their AP 
membership dues, their overriding interest is in decreasing advertiser costs, which is effected through competition. In addition, 
the Court notes that this statement was not made by a defendant in this action, and is not therefore probative of any defendant's 
intention. "
541,24," For a discussion of whether or not the refusal to accept the group deal constitutes an unlawful restraint of trade, see infra part 
V.A.3. "
544,25," AD/SAT first responded to the notice of termination in a letter dated September 28, 1994. The letter asked the Daily 
Oklahoman to reconsider its decision. See PX 693. "
545,26," AD/SAT alleges that NAA encouragement of AP's entrance into the market amounted to an endorsement of AdSEND, and 
apparently an implicit rejection of other ad deliverers. While the evidence does not support this conclusion, even if true an 
antitrust conspiracy is not established. In Schachar v. American Academy of Ophthalmology, Inc., 870 F.2d 397 (7th Cir. 1989), 
the Court citing the holding in Consolidated Metal, 846 F.2d at 292, stated that ""when a trade association provides information 
(there, gives a seal of approval) but does not constrain others to follow its recommendations, it does not violate the antitrust 
laws."" Id. at 399. In this case, there is no evidence that NAA constrained its members to take any action with respect to either 
AD/SAT or AdSEND. "
546,27," The strongest argument AD/SAT supplies to support NAA and NNN's involvement in the alleged conspiracy is a letter from 
Publicitas, NNN's ""one order/one bill"" clearing house which suggests a bundling of service between ""one order/one bill"" and 
AdSEND. However, written comments on the letter from NAA officials indicate that this idea of Publicitas, which is not a 
defendant in this action, was rejected. See PX 540. "
547,28," It is true that Newhouse encouraged the newspapers to engage in ""collective action."" However, as pointed out in Newhouse's 
reply brief, see Joint Reply Memorandum of Newhouse Defendants at 30-32, the goals of this collective action included 
""removing barriers to advertising,"" see PX 535 at 17, and ""satisfying the demand of advertisers for greater efficiency and 
effectiveness."" Id. at 11. There is nothing in these statements which could be interpreted as anticompetitive, and certainly 
nothing which indicates participation in a scheme to boycott AD/SAT."
547,29," AD/SAT only ties Advance to this litigation by stating that ""Advance caused its newspapers to due business with AD/SAT."" 
First Amended Complaint P 13. Summary judgment is appropriate for Advance because AD/SAT, in opposing summary 
judgment ""may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials"" of a pleading. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). "
548,1," The three subparagraphs are presented in their entirety in AD/SAT's motion papers. See plaintiff's Memorandum in Support of 
Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Complaint (""Pl's. Mem."") at 3-5. "
559,1," ""Wheeling"" refers to the transfer of electricity ""by direct transmission or displacement, of electric power from one utility to 
another over the facilities of an intermediate utility."" City of Chanute v. Kansas Gas & Elec. Co., 754 F.2d 310, 312 n.1 (10th Cir. 
1985). "
561,2," HN4[
] RCW 54.48.040 makes it clear that while the Commission has authority over service area agreements between public utilities and cooperatives, cooperatives are not included in the definition of a public utility. Nor does the Commission have 
regulatory authority over cooperatives except with respect to service area agreements and agreements for the acquisition or 
disposal of duplicating utility facilities. "
562,3," When more punitive measures are necessary, RCW 80.04.380 gives the WUTC authority to issue daily fines of $ 1,000 to 
public service companies found to have violated a Commission order, rule, direction, or requirement, and RCW 80.04.015 allows 
the WUTC to order a utility to cease and desist from providing service unless it is in compliance with the applicable regulations. "
563,4, The trial court found this was a straddling case and no one disputes this finding. Videotape Recorded Proceedings at 95.
563,5," This may be due to the contradictions between the language of the ruling and the WUTC's position as intervenor, as well as to 
the fact that the ruling was not directly before the court as neither party had appealed the Commission's ruling. "
566,6," While the evidence designed to show the parties' intent was not submitted until Puget filed its motion for reconsideration, the 
trial court considered it before denying that motion. Thus, the documents are properly part of the this court's consideration. See 
Scott Galvanizing, Inc. v. Northwest Enviroservices, Inc., 120 Wash. 2d 573, 580, 844 P.2d 428 (1993). "
567,7," Since the jury was instructed that Puget breached the contract and that a breach of contract may satisfy the ""improper means 
or purpose"" element of tortious interference, the tortious interference verdict is also reversed. "
571,8," The majority states the WUTC has authority over cooperatives with respect to service area agreements. Majority op. at 666 n.2. 
However, RCW 54.48.030 states the WUTC must approve the public utility's participation in such an agreement, not the 
participation of the cooperative. Indeed, RCW 54.48.040 expressly states nothing in RCW Chapter 54.48 may be construed to 
classify a cooperative as a public utility ""or to include cooperatives under the authority"" of the WUTC. Moreover, the majority asserts the exercise of WUTC regulatory authority ousts the jurisdiction of the courts. This is not 
necessarily so. RCW 80.04.440 provides a public service company that violates ""any law of this state,"" Title 80, or ""any order or 
rule of the commission,"" shall be liable for damages (and attorney fees in certain cases) in an action ""brought in any court of 
competent jurisdiction."" Nothing in the statute requires an administrative determination as a predicate to court jurisdiction. "
572,9," Presumably, if the majority is correct in its interpretation of RCW 19.86.170, our interpretation of RCW 19.86 in other cases is 
affected as well. For example, this Court and the Washington State Bar Association regulate attorneys. Short v. Demopolis, 103 
Wash. 2d 52, 62, 691 P.2d 163 (1984); RCW 2.48.060, .220, .230. Our application of RCW 19.86 to the entrepreneurial aspects 
of the practice of law in Short, 103 Wash. 2d at 60, is inconsistent with the majority's analysis."
572,10," RCW 19.86.920 states: The legislature hereby declares that the purpose of this act is to complement the body of federal law governing restraints of 
trade, unfair competition and unfair, deceptive, and fraudulent acts or practices in order to protect the public and foster fair 
and honest competition. It is the intent of the legislature that, in construing this act, the courts be guided by final decisions 
of the federal courts and final orders of the federal trade commission interpreting the various federal statutes dealing with 
the same or similar matters. . . . To this end this act shall be liberally construed that its beneficial purposes may be served. "
573,11," Even active agency approval of some part of the challenged conduct may not suffice. In City of Mishawaka, Ind v. Indiana & 
Mich. Elec. Co., 560 F.2d 1314 (7th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 922, 56 L. Ed. 2d 765, 98 S. Ct. 2274 (1978), the court 
held that despite the Federal Power Commission's concurrent exercise of jurisdiction to approve the utility's retail rates, there 
was no exemption sheltering its dual rate structure (charging higher rates to wholesale customers) from scrutiny in court. The 
court also noted that an antitrust action in court would provide compensatory and injunctive relief that was not available in 
agency proceedings concerned with approval of retail rates. 560 F.2d at 1321. In Frontier Enterprises, Inc. v. Amador Stage 
Lines, Inc., 624 F. Supp. 137, 143 (E.D. Cal. 1985), the court found the agency's approval of a tariff provided no exemption 
where the agency did not consider the alleged overall conspiracy and price squeeze involving the tariff rates. "
579,1," Discussion of the post-verdict request to mold the verdict on this counterclaim appears at Part III of this opinion. Discussion of 
contract defendant BAP's challenge to that portion of the verdict relating to plaintiff's specific contract claim for equipment rental 
charges appears at Part IV."
579,2," On February 24, 1995, the parties agreed to the entry of a nonsuit on plaintiff's claims against additional tort defendant Eastern 
Telelogic Corporation (""ETC""). "
580,3," Both the Sharetech and the SCS agreements provide identical ""sts"" definition sections listing the shared tenant services 
contemplated under the agreements. "
581,4," Historically, at the same time that Sharetech approached Pitcairn Properties in order to access an ""sts"" market in the latter's 
commercial real estate holdings, Sharetech sought to offer ""sts"" in Ten and Eleven Penn Center. Those two office buildings are 
adjacent to 1800 and 1880 JFK and not separated by public right of way. When Mr. Lordi was unable to obtain an exclusive 
contract with Sharetech, he required at the least that Sharetech not service any non-Pitcairn property from the ""sts"" Resource 
Center facility to be located in 1880 JFK. However, Sharetech bargained for the right to service the Penn Center properties from 
that facility and, hence, they are referenced in the agreements."
581,5," Article 7 of the Sharetech agreement contained a schedule of compensation contemplating Sharetech servicing ""other 
buildings"" for which the original owners (MetLife and Pitcairn Properties) were entitled to an amount which could conceivably 
total a net rentable square footage exceeding 5,000,000 square feet. To achieve such a total, it would have been necessary to 
include buildings other than 1800 and 1880 JFK and Ten and Eleven Penn Center buildings, the four of which are all specifically 
mentioned in both the Sharetech and the SCS agreements. Combined, however, these four buildings consist only of an 
aggregate 1,700,000 net rentable square feet. Plaintiff SCS argued that the above square footage comparison is additional 
evidence of the intent of the parties to extend provision of ""sts"" services to the ""other buildings""."
581,6," United States of America v. American Telephone and Telegraph Company, 552 F. Supp. 131 (D.C. 1982). "
582,7, Martin advised representatives of MetLife of this action and they agreed to it.
582,8," ""THE WITNESS (Widerman): Generally I would tell the [prospective] tenants that there was a tenant in the building who 
provided telecommunications services to tenants in the building, that they had an AT&T System 85 telephone switch in the 
building and that that switch was capable of providing what I called a lot of bells and whistles that are available in the 
telecommunications industry for tenants of all sizes. That [sic] [concluded], I would generally go on to say that included 
automatic lease cost routing, that they also had reserved telephone numbers so if a tenant was looking for quick occupancy, 
they could get their telephone number today and get their letterhead printed, generally things along those lines."" (2-22-95; 
Widerman; N.T 99-100)"
582,9," Section 1.01 contains a proviso at this juncture of the agreement which conditions SCS's right to the ""opportunity to provide 
STS in other existing buildings which are owned or managed by manager"" on manager's ""reasonable judgment"" that SCS was 
performing satisfactorily in the 1800 and 1880 JFK buildings. At no time, however, did the manager (first, Evans-Pitcairn 
Management Corporation and later, BAP) ever assert that SCS's performance at the 1800 and 1880 JFK buildings was not 
satisfactory. Instead, BAP consistently took the position that section 1.01, by use of the word ""may,"" conferred absolute 
discretion in BAP to refuse SCS's requests for access. "
583,10," Section 13.02 provides: ""As used in this agreement, affiliate of a party shall mean any person, corporation or other business 
entity which shall directly or indirectly control, be controlled by or be under common control with such party."""
583,11," In addition to Bell of PA, the evidence was clear that at least one other outside telecommunications provider, ETC, was 
permitted access without the prior knowledge of plaintiff SCS."
583,12," Trial evidence proved that as of July 1990, there were 582 wire pairs cross-connected to the fourth through seventh floors of 
1880 JFK that were not made by SCS despite this clear contractual requirement that SCS perform all such telephone wire cross-
connects. "
584,13," The jury found no breach of these marketing provisions by the contract defendants. Their relevance at this juncture is to draw 
the parameters of the contractually intended relationship between the parties. "
585,14," This incident, more fully described in connection with the court's consideration of defendants' challenge to the admissibility of 
deposition testimony by William O. Albertini, was referred to at trial as the ""RBI incident."" See Part II, section B(3), infra."
585,15," The SCS agreement included a provision whereby a building tenant could contract with a telecommunications server other 
than SCS: ""Notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, owners may advise tenants that they are free to use any 
provider of any of the services offered by SCS hereunder and, upon a decision of a tenant to use another service provider, 
owners may cooperate with and assist such other service provider in connection with its installation of service to such tenant."" [§ 
5.04 of the SCS agreement.] Cross-connects still were to be performed by SCS: ""Article II ""Installation "
586,," ""2.01(b) … Owner shall insure that only owner and SCS have access to all intermediate distribution frames and the main 
distribution frame as long as SCS is managing owner's wiring system. ""2.03 Owners shall provide at no charge to SCS adequate telephone closets and risers for installation of a TECHLOOP data 
highway within the buildings. SCS will have the exclusive right to use conduits, telephone punch-down plywood panels and 
electrical outlets within the telephone closet which are identified by owners and SCS as being required for the delivery of STS. 
SCS may secure the space in a telephone closet which is allotted to it by means of a locked metal or wire mesh enclosure. SCS 
has inspected the telephone closets in 1800 John F. Kennedy Boulevard and approved the same as meeting its requirements. ""Article XII ""Installation Improvement ""12.01 SCS shall have the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace any or all elements of its equipment or systems from 
time to time upon compliance with Article II of this agreement. SCS shall bear the cost of such modification or replacement."""

587,19," The contract defendants sought as well to introduce evidence that SCS's performance vis-a-vis tenants was substandard, 
thereby negating any obligation on their part to permit access to the ""other buildings."" Because the defendants could point to no 
evidence that they had ever asserted ""unsatisfactory performance"" prior to trial as a basis under section 1.01 of the agreement 
for denying SCS the opportunity to offer its services in the ""other buildings"", the court disallowed this defense (2/24/95; N.T. 72-
73)."
587,20, The tort defendants successfully convinced this court of the legal insufficiency of plaintiff's antitrust claims. 
588,21," On post-trial motion, the contract defendants insist that the reference to Ten and Eleven Penn Center appearing in section 
1.03 requires a finding that plaintiff's interpretation of that provision is per se unreasonable. See however, footnote 4, supra. The 
evidence was sufficient to explain these references (even if read as the original product of unartful contract drafting for 
SHARETECH) and does not, in context, make plaintiff's interpretation unreasonable."
588,22," The contract defendants also complain that, even assuming the existence of two reasonable but competing interpretations of 
section 1.03, the evidence required that the jury find a failure to contract. There is no reason, however, to believe that the jury 
failed in its obligation to follow the court's instructions in the law on failure of mutual assent. Indeed, adequate evidence was 
presented from which the jury could conclude that the contract defendants knew or had reason to know of the meaning attached 
to this provision by the plaintiff. "
589,23," Again, defendants make no objection to the court's charge to the jury on these subjects. "
590,24," See Comment j, Section 766 of Restatement (Second) of Torts (1979)."
590,25," Other important evidence developed at trial served to bolster plaintiff's proof. The court declines here to recite the full litany of 
the evidence beyond that already set forth in the factual background at Part I of this opinion, confident instead to rely on the 
record."
590,26," No objection has been taken to the court's instructions to the jury regarding the latter's obligations under the law in carrying out 
this task of contract interpretation. "
591,27," See discussion at Part II, B(4) and (5), infra."
591,28," The court further notes that defendants failed to raise this issue of duplication at trial. The court presented the parties ample 
opportunity to object to both the jury charge and the verdict sheet. To the extent defendants sought and were refused a line 
itemization on that portion of the verdict sheet relevant to the contract claims, defendants never expressed to the court a concern 
of duplication as between possible tort and contract damage awards. For this reason, the court finds a waiver of the duplication 
claim.  Dilliplaine v. Lehigh Valley Trust Company, 457 Pa. 255, 322 A.2d 114 (1974)."
591,29," The tort defendants complain of judicial error in the court's decision to permit plaintiff to amend its complaint in order to 
conform with the evidence presented at trial. In so doing, the court analyzed the allegations contained in the complaint and found 
sufficient elements to make a prima facie case of civil conspiracy. In addition, the court found that the defendants had notice of 
plaintiff's claim for civil conspiracy and that the amendment therefore was not unfairly prejudicial (See 2-28-95, N.T. 179-84; 3-1-
95, N.T. 2-5). Nothing presented on post-verdict motion persuades the court that its trial ruling was in error. See also Pa. R.C.P. 
126: ""The rules shall be liberally construed to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action or 
proceeding to which they are applicable. The court at every stage may disregard any error or defect of procedure which does not 
affect the substantial rights of the parties."" "
592,30," The tort defendants do not attempt on post-trial motion to argue that the contract claim made solely against BAP for equipment 
rental formed the basis of plaintiff's tortious interference claims. "
594,31," Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968 (1989)."
594,32," It also should be noted that, as there was no finding of tortious interference in either of these two cases, the court of appeals 
was not confronted with a valid civil conspiracy count. See Pelagatti v. Cohen, supra. "
595,33," In the case of the objection to the court's refusal to permit defendants the right to elicit testimony from tenants who, as SCS 
customers, purportedly experienced instances of unpleasant business dealings, there was no legitimate purpose for such 
evidence of specific bad acts, purely collateral in nature, and only would have served to further entangle the jury and lengthen 
what was well on its way to becoming for the jury an interminable trial (2-24-95, N.T. 55-63, 72-73). "
596,34," The court also adopts plaintiff's thorough analysis of the record set forth in its memorandum of law in opposition, pp. 35-46, 
including the basis for the court's refusal to strike the testimony of plaintiff's expert witness, Don Woods."
596,35," Defendants complain that the admission at trial of certain pre-trial deposition testimony by William O. Albertini, Vice-president 
and Chief Financial Officer of BAC, caused undue prejudice and requires the grant of a new trial. The testimony read to the jury 
was, as follows: ""QUESTION: And if a determination is made not to honor your obligations? ""ANSWER: I assume that would have been based on legal reasons or sound business judgment. ""QUESTION: Or what? I'm sorry. ""ANSWER: I said either sound business judgment or legal reasons."" See 2-8-95, N.T. 217-18. The court overruled trial counsel's objection to the admissibility of this evidence based on its probative value to the issue of tort 
defendant BAC's thought process at the very highest of corporate levels (See 2-8-95, N.T. 210-213; 2-24-95, N.T. 5). It clearly 
was relevant as well to plaintiff's other evidence that tort defendants BAC and Bell of PA knowingly and intentionally acted in 
concert to induce the joint ventures to breach the ""exclusive access"" provisions of the agreement. In this regard, in describing an 
incident referred to by the parties at trial as the ""RBI incident,"" Mary Quain of BAP previously had testified to an intervention on 
behalf of Bell of PA made by Mr. Albertini, whom she likened to ""God,"" and about whom she noted the extraordinary nature of 
any contact he might make with someone in her position: ""QUESTION: I just want to make it clear. Somebody at Bell Atlantic Corporation made the decision that it would be--that your 
statement [to plaintiff promising that Bell of PA would not be permitted in the telephone closets over the weekend, in accordance 
with plaintiff's interpretation of the March 7, 1991 stipulation and order binding upon all of the parties] would be overridden? ""ANSWER: That's right. ""QUESTION: And somebody at Bell Atlantic Corporation then conveyed that on to Mr. Maguire [Quain's boss]? ""ANSWER: To the best of my knowledge. ""QUESTION: Where did you get any knowledge as to that fact? ""ANSWER: Well, I had a phone call after I got home from work Friday night from Clair Zaff, who was our human resource 
person, telling me I would be getting a call from Bill Albertini from Bell Atlantic Corporation in reference to the situation, and she 
wanted to make sure that I wouldn't--that I wouldn't say, sure, it's Bill Albertini, clunk, and treat the call with the respect that it 
should be treated with. And she wanted to make sure I knew who he was. "
597,," ""QUESTION: Who was Mr. Albertini ? ""ANSWER: He is next to God. […] ""QUESTION: … Is it unusual for someone at Mr. Albertini's level to be calling you? ""ANSWER: Yes, extremely. ""QUESTION: How about to be calling Mr. Maguire? ""ANSWER: Extremely. […] ""QUESTION: Did… anybody tell you why somebody so important was placing this call? ""ANSWER: Just somebody knew somebody, and it worked its way up."" (2-8-95, N.T. 197-202. See also 2-24-95, N.T. 138-43) Mr. Albertini's deposition testimonial evidence also was corroborative of plaintiff's trial evidence that BAC acted outrageously. In summary, its relevance and probative value outweighed any prejudice to defendants on account of the context in which 
defendants claim Mr. Albertini spoke at the time of his deposition. Again, his availability at trial to offer an explanation of his 
intended meaning by those words (as well as the opportunity to deny Quain's testimony) was the means to counter-balance the 
plaintiff's evidence."
597,36," Before and during trial, the court carefully considered this issue and heard argument on it. See e.g. 1-27-95, N.T. 71-76. In 
addition, this issue was raised before Judge Goldman of this court as a motion for summary judgment. Judge Goldman denied 
the motion. "
599,37," In any event, since section 17.02 entitles plaintiff to recover any damages, at law or in equity, for a continuing default following 
written notice, the record evidence is undisputed that defendants failed to cure despite written notice of certain breaches made 
by way of plaintiff's counsel's correspondence in June 1989, May of 1990 and October 1990, as well as at the time of service of 
the complaint initiating this suit. Defendants' failure to reconcile the ""any damages"" language in section 17.02 with section 14.01 
under these circumstances is a fatal flaw in their argument. Section 17.02 does not state that no suit may be filed until after 
written notice is served and the ""cure"" period has elapsed. Since contract defendants took no steps to cure their defaults under 
the SCS agreement even after written notice, plaintiff was not limited by section 14.01 to the recovery of any consequential 
damages whatsoever (assuming the jury awarded any). See also this court's discussion of the import of section 17.02 of the 
agreement, infra."
599,38," The standard instruction reads: ""A party may waive, or give up, its contract rights. A party who sanctions or fails to protest the breach of a contract waives its 
right to recover for a breach of that contract. That party also cannot recover damages for non-performance or use breach as a 
defense in a lawsuit on that contract. A breach of contract may be waived either by implication or by express agreements. The 
party waiving a breach must know about the breach at the time of the waiver."" No. 15.11 (CIV) Waiver of Breach--Generally."
599,39," Indeed, the defense which was presented at trial focused on contract defendants' insistence that plaintiff's interpretation of the 
disputed contract provisions was plainly wrong. In this fashion, the record supports the conclusion that even had plaintiff done all 
that contract defendants say it did not do (e.g., specifically complained on a timely basis), contract defendants still would have "
600,," persisted in a refusal to permit SCS the opportunity to offer its services in the ""other buildings"" and still would not have required 
the 1800 and 1880 JFK tenant-affiliates to subscribe to plaintiff's services on account of contract defendants' differing 
interpretations of the disputed contract provisions."
600,40," See 3-7-95, N.T. 2."
600,41," Indeed, to the extent that the complaint (together with a copy of the agreement) was filed in January 1991 and the contract 
defendants persisted, right through to the time of trial in 1995, in certain conduct which plaintiff asserted was in breach of the 
agreement, nothing in section 17.02 would prevent the recovery of damages for that 4 year period. "
602,42," Moreover, the evidence does not support SCS's claim that it was the landlord alone who refused to proceed with arbitration. 
The evidence suggests it was Ms. Brown's insistence on non-contractual restrictions in the selection of an appropriate, neutral 
arbitrator which caused the initial stumbling block to arbitration. See 2-28-95, N.T. 51-53. "
603,43," The court gave the requested instruction, as follows: ""The law imposes upon all parties to a contract in connection with their 
performance under that contract the duty to act in good faith and to deal fairly, and this duty is recognized under the law even if 
the duty of good faith and fair dealing is not expressly written as a provision of the contract."" (3-6-95, N.T. 153)"
603,44," As noted elsewhere in this opinion, the parties to a contract may agree to a higher or lower interest rate than the legal rate of 
6% established for overdue contract payments under 41 Pa. C.S.A. § 202.  Daset Mining Corp. v. Industrial Fuels Corp., 326 Pa. 
Super. 14, 473 A.2d 584, 595 (1984); In re Rorie, 98 Bankr. 215 (E.D. Pa. 1989). "
608,1," Plaintiff's argument that a different standard should apply in this case because the District Court was ruling on a motion for 
summary judgment rather than a motion for a directed verdict fails. ""The inquiry on a summary judgment motion or a directed 
verdict is the same . . . "" Street v. J.C. Bradford & Co., 886 F.2d 1472, 1479 (6th Cir. 1989)."
608,2," Plaintiff offers three arguments in addition to conclusory ridicule. First, plaintiff argues that Haas (through its Distributech 
Division's area sales manager Ken Mularcik) did not explicitly state in its letter to plaintiff requesting removal of plaintiff's racks 
from Kroger markets that defendant was acting upon a request from Kroger. Appellant's Reply Brief at 4; JA at 90. Haas was 
under no obligation to explain the origin of its request and we find its failure to do so is without significant evidentiary value. See 
Street v. J.C. Bradford & Co., 886 F.2d 1472, 1479 & n.15 (6th Cir. 1989) (discussing the ""scintilla rule""). Second, plaintiff argues 
that the fact that defendant Haas had its racks sent to and assembled by an independent contractor who worked for defendant 
Harmon is evidence of ""the collusive nature of their conduct."" This argument appears to equate evidence of any working 
relationship with evidence of a conspiratorial relationship. While some relationship is a sine qua non of a conspiracy, the 
existence of a business relationship by itself is not sufficient evidence to rebut Haas' evidence that Kroger requested installation 
of the racks. Finally, plaintiff argues that Haas' behavior would be economically irrational unless part of a conspiracy. Appellant's 
Reply Brief at 3. This statement was rebutted by defendants. See Appellees' Brief at 16, n.7; JA at 206."
608,3," At oral argument, plaintiff stated that it did not believe Kroger to have been part of the conspiracy alleged in this case. "
614,1," Tricom also alleged that EDS used its monopoly power over CGS software to engage in various anti-competitive acts in 
violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2. The jury found for EDS, and Tricom does not request a new trial or 
judgment notwithstanding the verdict on this claim."
614,2," Tricom originally claimed that EDS tied the sale of CGS to the sale of CATIA and CADAM software also. However, this claim 
was dismissed during trial."
614,3," HN2[
] The elements of a tying claim under section 1 of the Sherman Act and a tying claim under section 3 of the Clayton Act are identical. Mozart Co. v. Mercedes Benz of N. Am., Inc., 833 F.2d 1342, 1352 (9th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 870, 102 
L. Ed. 2d 148, 109 S. Ct. 179 (1988); 3 P.M., Inc. v. Basic Four Corp., 591 F. Supp. 1350, 1355-56 (E.D. Mich. 1984). "
615,4, EDS admitted that the computer hardware was separate from the CGS software.
615,5," For example, in Jefferson Parish the Supreme Court found that anesthesiology services were separate from other hospital 
services because consumers often requested specific anesthesiologists to come to a hospital and provide services. Accord 
Digidyne Corp. v. Data General Corp., 734 F.2d 1336 (9th Cir. 1984) (separate demand for software and CPU's defeated single 
product defense), cert. denied, 473 U.S. 908, 87 L. Ed. 2d 657, 105 S. Ct. 3534 (1985)."
615,6, The relevant portion of the completed verdict form stated as follows: A. Tying Claim
615,1," . Do you find that plaintiff has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that CGS software and any of the following are 
separate products? a) Mainframe usage (CPU time): yes___ No_x b) Telecommunications links: Yes___ No_x Thus, the jury concluded its consideration of Tricom's tying claim, and found in favor of EDS. With regard to the computer 
hardware (which EDS conceded was a separate product), the jury found that Plaintiff did not prove by a preponderance of the 
evidence that EDS tied the purchase of CGS software to the purchase of hardware. Accordingly, the jury also found in favor of 
EDS on the claim that the hardware was tied. "
616,7," In either case, Plaintiff requests that the court grant a new trial on the remaining elements of Plaintiff's tying claim. "
617,8," See, e.g., testimony cited in Response brief, p. 7."
617,9," Testimony of McEwan, (10/26) 25:3-21; 35:12-36:3; (10/28) 36:14-37:2. Letter from Ralph Miller, exhibit 401. "
619,10," Accordingly, it is not necessary for the court to reach EDS's additional arguments that the motion for new trial should be 
denied because 1) Tricom's damage study is fatally flawed; 2) the jury's rejection of Tricom's monopoly claim bars Tricom from 
proving a tying claim; and 3) Tricom did not suffer an antitrust injury for which it may recover. "
625,1, Vakharia amended her original complaint to include the Title VII and ADEA claims after filing with the EEOC. 
630,2," At this juncture, the court deems it fit to note that Vakharia's responsive pleadings lack structure, relevance, and attention to 
grammatical rules. They are replete with statements like the following: ""Although all individuals in the department were on a fee 
for service private practice basis (which means that the patient not the hospital pays the anesthesiologoists [sic] bills) Complaint 
para 22, and the equal sharing of case loads in the department continued on that basis, Complaint para 24, until possible 
change by a sole provider contract with Evergreen which became effective April 11, 1994, Complaint para 106-120 ."" (Pl. Resp. 
Mot. Dismiss at 11) (citation omitted). The court admonishes Vakharia for her perfunctory approach to argument."
630,3," The court notes that HN3[
] § 1981 does not provide a claim for gender discrimination. Bratton v. Roadway Package Sys. Inc., No. 95-1560, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 2835, 1996 WL 74791, at *7 (7th Cir. Feb. 22, 1996)."
630,4," Defendants argue that Vakharia may not base her claims on any delay which may have occurred in the processing of her 
applications. The court disagrees. Just as ""justice delayed is justice denied,"" Schroeder v. City of Chicago, 927 F.2d 957, 960 
(7th Cir. 1991), employment delayed may be employment denied. ""At some point delay must ripen into deprivation, because 
otherwise a suit alleging deprivation would be forever premature."" Id. (holding that fire fighter could state a claim for relief for 
delay in denial of disability benefits). "
631,5," The court notes that, in 1993, Vakharia and her attorney were alerted to their previous failure to follow EEOC requirements in 
another case filed by Vakharia. Vakharia v. Swedish Covenant Hosp., 824 F. Supp. 769 (N.D. Ill. 1993)."
631,6," The Seventh Circuit has ""made it clear that a litigant who fails to press a point by supporting it with pertinent authority, or by 
showing why it is sound despite a lack of supporting authority, forfeits the point."" Doe v. Johnson, 52 F.3d 1448, 1457 (7th Cir. 
1995). "
632,7," The court notes that such an argument would be difficult to reconcile with her contention that all parties are so separate that 
they are not subject to intracorporate immunity."
632,8," Vakharia's general assertion under § 1981 is that the Defendants interfered with her ability to make contracts with patients 
because of her race. "
635,9," It is unclear whether § 1985 provides relief for gender discrimination. See Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, 506 U.S. 
263, 113 S. Ct. 753, 758, 122 L. Ed. 2d 34 (1993). As Defendants have not argued against the inclusion of gender discrimination 
in Vakharia's § 1985 claim, the court will not address the issue at this juncture."
635,10," Vakharia has not named the entities of the Board or the MEC as defendants. Accordingly, her allegations will be considered 
only as they run to the members of those groups. "
636,11," Vakharia argues that the Copperweld doctrine does not apply outside of the antitrust context. This argument, in the face of 
repeated straightforward Seventh Circuit rulings to the contrary, indicates Vakharia's failure to research her arguments. See 
Hartman, 4 F.3d at 469. "
637,12," Mysteriously, Vakharia also alleges that the ""as needed"" contract offered to her by Evergreen, which she never signed, ""could"" 
have resulted in the ""national blackballing"" of Vakharia because it permitted the Hospital to report to state and federal authorities 
Vakharia's failure to provide the level of compassion due a patient. (Compl. at 41.) The anesthesiologist Defendants argue that 
such a potential illegality does not give rise to a cognizable § 1 claim. In response, Vakharia states: ""With respect to competition in the provision of anesthesia services in the national market, such 
unilateral contract rights to label an Anesthesiologist 'guilty of patient mistreatment' would given [sic] an impenetrable shield to 
sole source providers with contracts at one or more hospitals in any local area of competition. A slave owner in ancient Rome 
would be proud of the control provided, for such an owner could ban a slave or freeman from the civilized world (of medicine) 
permanently without any legal recourse for either the slave or freeman. If all slave owners had such power, the increase in such 
owners [sic] power would be obvious."" (Pl. Resp. Staff Anesthesiologists' Mot. Dismiss at 6.) Nevertheless, Vakharia fails to allege that she was even a party to such a contract, much less a victim of slave trade. Vakharia's 
imaginary parade of horribles is not actionable in federal court. "
638,13," Even if Vakharia had alleged such a conspiracy, for the reasons stated in the conspiracy section, supra, that conspiracy could 
only have existed between the Hospital and Evergreen."
638,14," Again, Vakharia has named neither the Board nor the MEC as entities, only their individual members. Accordingly, the court 
will consider Count V against the members."
638,15," Attaching copies of the Bylaws, the Staff bylaws, and the Rules, Defendants ask the court to rule, as a matter of law, on Count 
V. If, on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the 
court, the motions shall be treated as if for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b). 
When considering materials outside the pleadings, it is in the court's discretion to characterize a motion as one for summary 
judgment. See St. Paul Ins. of Bellaire v. Afia Worldwide Ins., 937 F.2d 274, 277 (5th Cir. 1991). In the instant case, the court 
declines to characterize Defendants' motion as such, given the factual disagreements over which documents are relevant. See 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f). "
640,16," For example, Vakharia details changes in the anesthesia staff (stating when various specific physicians retired or left the 
Hospital), complaints about anesthesia scheduling shortages, and problems that various anesthesia staffing conflicts (for 
example, explaining that one anesthesiologist had to reschedule a vacation due to understaffing). Although perhaps pleaded to 
demonstrate a possible vacancy in the Department, these ""specifics"" blur from sight information giving rise to Vakharia's alleged 
claims. An example at the opposite end of Vakharia's pleading spectrum surf aces when, despite Vakharia's allegation of racial 
discrimination, Vakharia fails to set forth information demonstrating racial animus on the part of most of the approximately 500 
Defendants. "
646,*," Honorable Richard Mills, U.S. District Judge for the Central District of Illinois, sitting by designation."
646,1," We exercise dual jurisdiction in this case.  28 U.S.C. §§ 1291, 1292(b). HN1[
] The denial of a motion for summary judgment 
under the state-action immunity doctrine is immediately appealable under the collateral order exception to the final judgment 
rule. See Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 69 S. Ct. 1221, 93 L. Ed. 1528 (1949); Praxair, Inc. v. Florida 
Power & Light Co., 64 F.3d 609, 611 (11th Cir. 1995). In addition, the district court certified its summary judgment order for 
immediate appeal and this court granted Appellants' protective petition for permission to appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). 
The appeals were then consolidated by order of this court as they both involve the same parties and the same issues, and are 
taken from the same summary judgment order."
646,2," Cogeneration is the production of electricity and useful thermal energy at a single facility. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies 
Act of 1978 (PURPA), Pub.L. No. 95-617, 92 Stat. 3117 (1978), defines a cogeneration facility as a facility that produces electric 
energy and steam, or other forms of useful energy, such as heat, for industrial, commercial, heating, or cooling purposes.  16 
U.S.C. § 796(18)(A). Cogeneration can be an efficient use of fuel because a cogeneration facility (unlike some more traditional 
power plants) can utilize thermal energy that might otherwise be a wasted by-product in the production of electricity. For 
example, the Miami downtown cogeneration facility that is the subject of this case has the capability to produce both electricity 
for the Downtown Government Center and chilled water for air conditioning. PURPA directs the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (FERC) to promulgate rules to facilitate cogeneration and to purchase electricity from cogeneration and small 
power production facilities at a rate that does not exceed the incremental cost to the electric utility of alternative electric energy; 
state utility commissions are then directed to implement and expand FERC rules at the state level.  16 U.S.C. § 824a-3."
646,3," Wheeling electric power means to transfer, by direct transmission or displacement, electric power from one utility to another 
over the facilities of an intermediate utility. See Otter Tail Power Co. v. U.S., 410 U.S. 366, 368, 93 S. Ct. 1022, 1025, 35 L. Ed. 
2d 359 (1973)."
646,4," Although not styled as such, we note that the motion for summary judgment ruled upon by the district court was really a motion 
for partial summary judgment. Our determination here does not entirely resolve the dispute between these parties as other 
claims remain to be resolved on remand. "
647,5," Prior to PURPA, and for most of the twentieth century, electric utilities were given monopoly franchises to take advantage of the 
cost benefits of centralized production. Douglas Gegax & Kenneth Nowotny, Competition and the Electric Utility Industry: An 
Evaluation, 10 Yale J. On Reg. 63 (1993). In return, the utility gave the state the right to regulate price and service quality, 
restrict profit rates, and veto investment decisions. It vested the state with the authority to balance consumer and stockholder 
interests. Id. Following the 1973 Arab oil embargo, the public began to perceive a worldwide energy crisis and, in the late 1970's, 
the practice of monopolist utilities was disrupted as Congress and the executive branch took a number of steps to respond to 
this problem. Id. at 64. PURPA was one such Congressional response. Its passage marked the beginning of a radical change in 
the status quo for utilities. PURPA encouraged fuel conservation and efficient pricing by relaxing restrictions on entry into the 
(former monopolist's) service area. It also encouraged the development of cogeneration. Id.; see American Paper Institute, Inc. 
v. American Elec. Power Service Corp., 461 U.S. 402, 404-05, 103 S. Ct. 1921, 1923-24, 76 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1983). Historically, 
utilities were reluctant to purchase power from and to sell power to the nontraditional cogeneration facility.  F.E.R.C. v. 
Mississippi, 456 U.S. 742, 750-51, 102 S. Ct. 2126, 2132-33, 72 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1982); supra n. 2."
647,6," TEC Cogeneration, Inc. (TEC) is a subsidiary of Appellee Thermo Electron Corporation (Thermo). RRD Corp. (RRD) is a 
subsidiary of Appellee Rolls-Royce, Inc. (Rolls-Royce). TEC and RRD are joint venture partners in the partnership South Florida 
Cogeneration Associates, also an Appellee."
647,7," Appellant FPL Group, Inc., is a public utility holding company, subject to the provisions of the Public Utility Holding Company 
Act of 1935 (PUHCA). As FPL's parent corporation, it owns all its capital stock. Appellant FPL Energy Services, Inc., itself a 
cogeneration project developer, is a one hundred percent-owned subsidiary of FPL Group Capital, Inc., which in turn is a one 
hundred percent-owned subsidiary of FPL Group, Inc."
647,8," FPL is the fifth largest electric utility in the United States. It is an integrated electric utility that performs three functions 
(generation, transmission, distribution and sale) via a transmission system integrated within an interstate power grid. FPL 
generates electricity by transforming heat, moving water, or other forms of energy into electric power. In so doing, it uses large 
quantities of oil, natural gas, and bituminous coal. These substances are transported into Florida through interstate commerce. 
Within Florida, FPL generates electricity at licensed nuclear power plants. FPL transports electric power from generating plants 
through electric transmission facilities to distribution points. From there, delivery and sales are made to ultimate consumers."
647,9," In 1981, the Florida Legislature authorized and directed the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) to develop state 
regulations on the relationship between cogenerators and Florida's electric utility companies. 1981 Fla.Laws. ch. 81-131, § 1 
(codified as amended at Fla.Stat. § 366.05 (1994)). The PSC is charged with exclusive legislative authority under Chapter 366, 
Florida Statutes, to regulate electric utilities, including investor-owned electric utilities, municipal electric utilities, and rural 
electric cooperatives in the state. The PSC exercises the state's police power by ensuring safe, adequate, and reliable electric 
service at fair, just, and reasonable rates. Pursuant to Chapter 366 and PURPA, the PSC also exercises extensive authority over 
the relationship between electric utilities and cogenerators. It seeks to balance competing interests: the encouragement of cost-
effective cogeneration on one hand and the avoidance of its subsidization by utility ratepayers on the other. "
648,10," The generation facilities themselves are owned by an investment group, Florida Energy Partners, that has no ownership 
affiliation with the Cogenerators."
648,11," For the initial sixteen-year period of operation, Center was projected to generate cumulative profits of approximately seventy-
five million dollars."
648,12," Although FPL was not a party to the final contract, it participated in its negotiation. An early draft contained a best efforts 
clause that provided that, if electrical demand at Center proved inadequate to absorb output, Dade would use Center power at 
other Dade facilities, municipal buildings, and state buildings. FPL objected to the provisions concerning municipal and state 
buildings, claiming they were in violation of Florida law prohibiting retail sales of electricity to unrelated third parties. E.g., PW 
Ventures, Inc. v. Nichols, 533 So. 2d 281 (Fla.1988) (a cogenerator may consume the electricity it generates itself or sell it 
wholesale to utilities; it may not make retail sales to third parties). Dade and the Cogenerators agreed to make the contract 
changes."
648,13," About this time, with the help of a consulting firm, FPL began conducting an eighteen-month study about the effects (including 
the potential threat) of cogeneration on it and its ratepayers, entitled ""Strategic Energy Business Study"" (SEBS)."
648,14," During the initial sixteen-year period of operation, Cogenerators sustained estimated losses of several thousand dollars per 
month. When the record was closed in 1989, Cogenerators calculated cumulative losses of over sixty million dollars."
648,15," Cogenerators filed separate suit in Florida state court charging Dade with fraudulently overstating Center's projected electrical 
demands. This litigation was settled in 1994."
648,16," Under PURPA and implementing federal and state regulations, utilities are required, upon request, to purchase the power 
output of cogeneration facilities at a price equal to what it would have cost the utility to generate that power, or its avoided cost 
rate."
648,17," Under PSC regulations, the Cogenerators can ask FPL to wheel electricity from Center to Hospital only if they qualify under 
the self-service wheeling rules: (1) there must be an exact identity of ownership between the generator and the consumer of the 
electricity; and (2) wheeling will not increase rates to utility, i.e., FPL ratepayers. Fla.Admin.Code R. 25-17.0882. Under Florida 
law, a cogenerator may not sell electricity at retail.  PW Ventures, 533 So. 2d at 281. "
649,18," The fact that Dade had legal title to the building in which the electrical generating equipment was housed was not controlling. 
The PSC also saw no merit to Dade's argument that its option to purchase the cogeneration equipment was the equivalent of 
equitable title."
649,19," The PSC did not address the impact, if any, of the wheeling request upon other FPL customers."
649,20," The Cogenerators' complaint, asserting antitrust and tortious-interference claims, was filed in November 1988. An amended 
complaint was filed in March 1989. Count One of the amended complaint claims that FPL's actions constituted an unlawful 
monopoly and unlawful attempts to monopolize trade in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2; Count Two 
claims that the conduct constituted an unlawful conspiracy in restraint of trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 
U.S.C. § 1; Count Three claims that FPL's actions constituted unlawful discrimination in price or services or facilities furnished to 
customers, in violation of Section 2 of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13; Count Four 
claims that FPL tortiously interfered with the Cogenerators' contractual relations in violation of common law. "
650,21," The Parker Court held that the purpose of the Sherman Act ""was to suppress combinations to restrain competition and 
attempts to monopolize by individuals and corporations."" The Act did not prohibit anticompetitive restraints prescribed by the 
states ""as an act of government."" 317 U.S. at 352, 63 S. Ct. at 314."
650,22," The clear articulation requirement ensures that antitrust law will not be set aside unless the state does in fact intend to 
displace competition, i.e., the challenged scheme does not simply represent unsanctioned private conduct. See generally 1 P. 
Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law 207, 214 (1978). The active supervision requirement ensures that even where there is state 
authorization, such authorization constitutes more than mere permission to violate the Sherman Act. A state may displace the 
Act, but in doing so it must replace it with a scheme of state regulation. Id. at 213. "
651,23," The summary judgment record includes more than fifty PSC orders dealing with issues germane to the utility/cogenerator 
relationship."
651,24," SEBS examine alternatives in preparing for the future and provide, for example, a good business plan for the possibility that 
interest rates may fall, or the population growth rate of Florida may rise. When FPL has finished its good business planning, the 
reaction it takes to this planning will then be subject to state regulation. If the end product of the SEBS is illegal, the conduct will 
be struck down when the action is taken or proposed to the PSC. See City of Columbia, 499 U.S. at 376-77, 111 S. Ct. at 1352. "
652,25," As Dade did not own the generating equipment, there was not an exact identity of ownership between the generator of the 
electricity on the one hand, and the ultimate consumer of the electricity, on the other. Fla.Admin.Code, Rule 25-17.0882; PW 
Nichols, 533 So. 2d at 281."
652,26," It is clear that the district court is pondering why FPL was not heard to complain, from a legal standpoint, about this 
cogeneration project when it was on the drawing board. We, too, have wondered in amazement as to how this project, structured 
as it was, made it this far. We can do no more than ponder, however, as that is not the question before us. "
653,27," HN12[
] There are two main differences between the state action doctrine and the Noerr/Pennington doctrine. When the 
government chooses to displace competition without being petitioned to do so by private parties, state action applies but 
Noerr/Pennington does not. When private parties petition the government to displace competition, but the government refuses to 
take such action, Noerr/Pennington applies but state action does not. Matthew R. Gutwein, The Commercial Exception: A 
Necessary Limitation to the Noerr-Pennington Doctrine, 63 Ind.L.J. 401, 411 n. 68 (1987); see generally Daniel R. Fischel,

U.S. at 511-12, 92 S. Ct. at 612-13."
653,29," Private action that is a sham (not genuinely aimed at procuring favorable government action) is not protected, regardless of 
the forum.  Noerr, 365 U.S. at 144, 81 S. Ct. at 533 (""There may be situations in which a publicity campaign, ostensibly directed 
toward governmental action, is a mere sham to cover what is actually nothing more than an attempt to interfere directly with the 
business relationships of a competitor and the application of the Sherman Act would be justified.""). "
654,30," See also McGuire Oil Co. v. Mapco, Inc., 958 F.2d 1552, 1560 (11th Cir. 1992) (""It is axiomatic that actions taken with an anti-
competitive purpose or intent remain insulated from antitrust liability under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine."") (emphasis added)."
654,31," Allied Tube involved the National Fire Protection Association, a private standard-setting organization. It set product standards 
and published fire protection codes that were routinely adopted into law by state and local government. The code permitted 
electrical conduits made of steel but not of plastic. A plastics manufacturer proposed the adoption of plastic conduits into the 
code as well. The proposal was approved in committee. It could then be adopted by a simple majority of association members at 
their annual meeting. Before the vote, the nation's largest steel producer packed the annual meeting with sympathetic no-voting 
members and the plastics proposal was defeated. A jury found the steel manufacturer liable for its actions. The district court 
granted a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, reasoning that the steel manufacturer was entitled to antitrust immunity under 
Noerr. The Second Circuit reversed, refusing to extend Noerr immunity and the Supreme Court agreed. Id."
654,32," ""We think that, given the context and nature of the conduct, it can more aptly be characterized as commercial activity with a 
political impact. HN17[
] Just as the antitrust laws should not regulate political activities ""simply because those activities have a 
commercial impact,"" [Noerr,] 365 U.S. at 141, 81 S. Ct. at 531, so the antitrust laws should not necessarily immunize what are in 
essence commercial activities simply because they have a political impact."" 486 U.S. at 507, 108 S. Ct. at 1940."
654,33," The district court accepted the Noerr defense, however, with respect to FPL's lobbying of the PSC to deny the Cogenerators' 
self-service wheeling claim, apparently on the basis that the Cogenerators had conceded that FPL's lobbying efforts during the 
PSC hearings were immune from antitrust liability. "
655,34," Todorov is distinguishable as it did not involve legislative lobbying but rather the lobbying of a hospital peer group committee. 
Furthermore, the Todorov panel limited its discussion of Noerr to a footnote, 921 F.2d at 1446 n. 14, declined to rule on the 
Noerr issue, and affirmed the district court on other grounds, id."
655,35," The district court decision in Hill Aircraft was affirmed by this court without discussion. Moreover, the district court in Hill 
Aircraft expressly distinguished the facts before it from those involving legislative lobbying. 561 F. Supp. at 675."
655,36," Allied Tube actually supports FPL's position, that is, they were immune from antitrust liability when they lobbied Commission, 
an ""open political arena,"" or Dade's legislative body."
655,37," In reality, FPL should be expected to speak out; otherwise, the PSC could find that FPL wasn't protecting its energy customer 
base, and, subject FPL to serious penalty if, as a result, electric rates to consumers were driven up. "

680,6," Regardless of how the tying product market is defined, Lasertech also cannot prevail under the Clayton Act. If the tying product

SCM Corp., 415 F.2d 55, 61 (4th Cir. 1969). If the tying product market is new convenience copiers with warranties, Xerox lacks sufficient market power in the copier market 
to support per se liability under the Clayton Act. See, e.g., Town Sound and Custom Tops, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 959 
F.2d 468, 477 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 868, 121 L. Ed. 2d 139, 113 S. Ct. 196 (1992). Lasertech concedes that Xerox 
has less than eighteen percent of the convenience copier market, which is insufficient under the circumstances. See., e.g., 
Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 26-27 (thirty percent insufficient); Morgenstern v. Wilson, 29 F.3d 1291, 1296 n.3 (8th Cir. 
1994)(thirty percent insufficient in § 2 monopolization claim), cert. denied, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1068, 115 S. Ct. 1100 (1995); Baxley-
DeLamar Monuments, Inc. v. American Cemetery Ass'n, 938 F.2d 846, 852 (8th Cir. 1991)(twenty-nine to thirty-one percent 
insufficient to support tying claim)."
680,7," We need not consider the application of the Clayton Act to the Xerox extended warranties because they are services rather 
than goods.  15 U.S.C. § 14; see supra note . "
694,1," The respective assented-to motions of the parties to file reply memoranda to the motions in limine, documents 196, 197, are 
granted, and such memoranda are herewith docketed as of the date of this order."
694,2," The court notes that defendants' objection to plaintiffs' motion is incorporated into their own cross-motion for partial summary 
judgment. The court further notes that the memoranda filed in conjunction with said motions and objections--44, 40, and 55 
pages, respectively--are prolix beyond peradventure and would, under new Local Rule 7.1(3), be refused by the court as 
excessive by some 19, 15, and 30 pages, respectively. In that the issues raised and argued in the subject papers could most 
certainly have been addressed with greater brevity, it is unclear to the court whether counsel's actions represent a disdain for the 
nation's timber reserves, an affinity for the pulp wood market, or an indifference to the fact that there are lawsuits other than the 
instant one requiring a share of the court's attention. "
696,3," In its pre-1988-amendment form, which form governs this litigation, section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, codified at 15 U.S.C. § 
1125(a), provided: HN4[
] Any person who shall affix, apply, or annex, or use in connection with any goods or services, or any container or 
containers for goods, a false designation of origin, or any false description or representation, including words or other symbols 
tending falsely to describe or represent the same, and shall cause such goods or services to enter into commerce, and any 
person who shall with knowledge of the falsity of such designation of origin or description or representation cause or procure the 
same to be transported or used in commerce or deliver the same to any carrier to be transported or used, shall be liable to a civil 
action by any person doing business in the locality falsely indicated as that of origin or in the region in which said locality is 
situated, or by any person who believes that he is or is likely to be damaged by the use of any such false description or 
representation."
696,15, U.S.C. § 1125(a) (1982).
696,4," The amended language of section 43(a) now reads, (a)(1) Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or services, or any container for goods, uses in commerce any word, 
term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, or any false designation of origin, false or misleading description of 
fact, or false or misleading representation of fact, which-- (A) is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person 
with another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial activities by 
another person, or (B) in commercial advertising or promotion, misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities, or geographic origin of his or her 
or another person's goods, services, or commercial activities, shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damages by such act."
696,15, U.S.C. § 1125(a) (Supp. 1995). 
697,5," Even if the court were to assume arguendo the continued vitality of the Samson Crane holding, defendants' actions would fall 
within the scope of conduct prohibited by section 43(a) because the deceitful practices alleged herein directly involve, unlike in 
Samson Crane, a false description or representation of the goods themselves--DD steel in place of 440C. Accord Schroeder, 
supra, 577 F. Supp. at 723 (deceitful practices in Samson Crane ""involved no false description or representation of the goods 
themselves"")."
697,6," The court notes the existence of a similar test involving five factual showings. See, e.g., Alpo Petfoods, Inc. v. Ralston Purina 
Co., 286 U.S. App. D.C. 192, 913 F.2d 958, 964 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (""to prevail in a false advertising suit under section 43(a), a 
plaintiff must prove that the defendant's ads were false or misleading, actually or likely deceptive, material in their effects on 
buying decisions, connected with interstate commerce, and actually or likely injurious to the plaintiff"" (footnote and citations 
omitted)); U.S. Healthcare, Inc. v. Blue Cross of Greater Philadelphia, 898 F.2d 914, 922 (3d Cir.) (identifying and analyzing five

699,8," Because there already exists a common law right to protection from unfair competition in New Hampshire, with only its 
parameters left unexplored, the general law of this circuit ""that a plaintiff who chooses the federal forum cannot expect a federal 
court to break new ground in recognizing rights under state law that have not yet been identified by the state's own courts,"" 
Penney v. Town of Middleton, 888 F. Supp. 332, 342 (D.N.H. 1994), does not here apply. "
700,9," The rulings made herein are further ordered to apply to all plaintiffs and defendants included in the caption, the court finding 
that (1) Pacamor has not waived its standing to sue under the Lanham Act for defendants' sales to customers other than the 
Department of Defense and (2) defendants, having previously argued their interconnectedness, may not now disavow such 
corporate arrangement in order to partition liability. Defendants' arguments relative to the proper statute of limitations is an 
attempt to limit the damages awarded, if any, rather than a merits-based challenge, and is more elaborately raised in one of the 
twelve pending motions in limine. Resolution of such issue, therefore, is addressed infra."
700,10," HN15[
] Rule 402, Fed. R. Evid., provides that ""all relevant evidence is admissible, [and] . . . evidence which is not relevant is not admissible."""
700,11," Rule 403, Fed. R. Evid., provides, ""Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially 
outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue 
delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence."""
700,12," HN16[
] Rule 401, Fed. R. Evid., provides, ""'Relevant evidence' means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the 
evidence."""
700,13," Indeed it is true that, as defendants assert, ""dissimilarities between experimental and actual conditions affect the weight, not 
the admissibility, of the evidence."" Bonilla v. Yamaha Motors Corp., 955 F.2d 150, 155 (1st Cir. 1992) (citing Robbins v. Whelan,

The content of the ball bearings at issue, however, is not a condition of experimentation. "
702,14," The representation regarding ""400 series stainless steel"" is an area where equivalence evidence may be appropriate, since if 
DD steel's characteristics are such that it may be categorized in the 400 series, such representation is not ""literally false."" It may, 
however, prove susceptible to the alternate § 43(a) prong of ""consumer confusion."" This issue has not been briefed and thus is 
not properly before the court."
702,15," The other ITC findings related to the Anti-Dumping Act, 19 U.S.C. § 1673d(b), a claim plaintiffs earlier withdrew. See Pacamor 
Bearings, supra, 892 F. Supp. at 355. "
703,16," The court does note, however, that elements of plaintiffs' unfair competition claim may indeed be similar to the essence of an 
antitrust claim: ""A business rival has priced its products in an unfair manner with an object to eliminate or retard competition and 
thereby gain and exercise control over prices in the relevant market."" Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 
509 U.S. 209,    , 113 S. Ct. 2578, 2587, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1993). "
704,17," RSA 358-A:3, IV-a, sets a two-year ""exempt transaction"" period limiting actions under the Consumer Protection Act to those 
taking place no more than two years prior to the filing of the complaint. As to the Lanham Act and common-law claims, the court 
finds these actions most akin to those sounding in fraud, to which the state's three-year limitations statute applies, RSA 508:4, 
and thus pushes the window of recovery on those claims to June 15, 1987. "
705,18," ""[A] proposed expert witness must be qualified to testify as an expert by 'knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education[,]'

707,19," The court further notes plaintiffs' current indecision regarding whether they will call Mr. Papapietro as a ""testifying expert or 
non-testifying consultant,"" Plaintiffs' Objection at 1 n.1, and their further indication that a decision on said matter will be 
forthcoming ""on or before March 20, 1996."" Id. It would appear to be in the interest of all parties that the plaintiffs make such

a party may not thereafter assign as error a defect in the magistrate judge's order to which objection was not timely made. The 
district judge to whom the case is assigned shall consider such objections and shall modify or set aside any portion of the 
magistrate judge's order found to be clearly erroneous or contrary to law. "
709,21," The elements of the attorney-client privilege have also been broken down as follows: ""(1) where legal advice of any kind is sought (2) from a professional legal adviser in his capacity as such, (3) the 
communications relating to that purpose (4) are made in confidence (5) by the client, (6) are at his instance permanently

726,*, Of the United States Court of International Trade. 
727,1," CAPECO tried to argue below and again argues here, that the contracts it executed with Caribbean and Harbor were 
qualitatively different in their non-price terms and conditions from CAPECO's arrangement with Coastal, justifying the discounts. 
Coastal responds that it was never offered the terms and conditions that Caribbean and Harbor received. In light of the jury's 
verdict for Coastal on the price discrimination claim, from conflicting evidence such as this, we draw the (reasonable) conclusion 
in Coastal's favor. "
729,2, We address this distinct argument below.
729,3," Fed. R. Civ. P. 51 states, in pertinent part, that HN7[
] no party shall assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto before 
the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection."
729,4," While this court has admitted ""occasional"" exceptions to the ""raise-or-waive"" principle, see National Assoc. of Social Workers v. 
Harwood, 69 F.3d 622 at 627-28, the concerns that justify an exception are not implicated here, see id., 69 F.3d at 627-28 
(finding exception given certain circumstances including the fact that failure to raise issue did not deprive court of appeals of 
useful factfinding, and the fact that the issue in question raises constitutional concerns)."
729,5, The relevant language is as follows: 
730,," HN12[
] It shall be unlawful for any person, either directly or indirectly, to discriminate in price between different 
purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where such commodities are sold for use, consumption, or resale in 
Puerto Rico, and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a 
monopoly in any line of commerce in Puerto Rico, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either 
grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them."
730,10," L.P.R.A. 263 (1976). Furthermore, Puerto Rico law includes a counterpart for the section 4 of the Clayton Act's authorization 
of treble damages. See 10 L.P.R.A. 268 (1976)."
730,6," See Caribe BMW, Inc., 19 F.3d at 753 (1st Cir. 1994) (interpreting ""Puerto Rico's laws as essentially embodying the 
jurisprudence relevant to the parallel federal law,"" where antitrust plaintiff asserted claims under a Puerto Rico antitrust law that 
paralleled its federal antitrust law claim); Whirlpool Corp. v. U.M.C.O. Int'l Corp., 748 F. Supp. 1557, 1565 n.4 (S.D. Fla. 1990) 
(noting that ""federal precedents construing the [Clayton Act, as amended by the] Robinson-Patman Act are applicable to the 
interpretation of Section 263"" of the Puerto Rico Anti-Monopoly Act); see also Diario de Sesiones, 1964, Vol. 18, Part 4, pp.

Salt rule without discussion of Brooke Group); Rebel Oil Co. v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 51 F.3d 1421, 1446 (9th Cir. 1995) (noting 
in dicta that ""in holding that a primary-line plaintiff must demonstrate an injury flowing from an aspect of the defendant's conduct 
injurious to consumer welfare, we intend in no way to affect the standard for antitrust injury in secondary-line cases""). But see 
also Bob Nicholson Appliance, Inc. v. Maytag Co., 883 F. Supp. 321, 326 (S.D. Ind. 1994) (holding that ""we are persuaded that 
the Seventh Circuit would extend the reasoning of Brooke Group and require actual injury to competition""). "
732,8," The Robinson-Patman Act ""attaches to competitive relations between a given seller and his several customers. It concerns 
discrimination between customers of the same seller. It has nothing to do with . . . requiring the maintenance of any relationship 
in prices charged by a competing seller."" H.R. Rep. No. 2287, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. § 8 (1936)."
732,9," While concerns about overenforcement harming overall consumer welfare may be valid, the Supreme Court retains the option 
of speaking further on this issue. See generally Paul Larule, Robinson-Patman Act in the Twenty-First Century: Will the Morton 
Salt Rule Be Retired? 48 S.M.U. L. Rev. 1917, 1927 (1995) (concluding that ""when an appropriate case comes before it, the 
[Supreme] Court may well decide to make the final cut""); Hovenkamp § 14.6a (arguing that, after Brooke Group, ""a 
reinterpretation of Robinson-Patman so as to permit secondary-line injury only when competition itself is threatened is long 
overdue""). "
734,10," There is conflicting authority for the proposition that a jury may infer actual injury from circumstantial evidence. See 
Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 697-700, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777, 82 S. Ct. 1404 (1962). However, we need 
not consider here whether this standard, which is more favorable to Coastal, applies rather than the standard that CAPECO 
advocates, since Coastal actually did proffer evidence, albeit only employee testimony, that its prices were causing it to lose 
business. "
736,11," The plaintiff must also define the relevant product market.  H.J., Inc. v. Int'l Tel. & Tel. Corp., 867 F.2d 1531, 1537 (8th Cir. 
1989). The parties agree that the relevant product market is residual fuel oil sold by all refineries for use as bunker fuel for 
ocean-going vessels."
736,12," The jury answered ""yes"" to the special interrogatory asking ""Did Coastal establish that there is a relevant market comprising of 
the sale of residual fuel oil or diesel to bunker fuel resellers in the port of San Juan and that CAPECO has monopoly power in 
the relevant market?"" "
738,13," Article 1802 states, in pertinent part, that: [a] person who by an act or omission causes damage to another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the 
damage so done. Id."
738,14," In 1991, Rule 50 was amended, and the term ""judgment as a matter of law"" was adopted ""to refer to preverdict"" (directed 
verdict) and ""postverdict"" (judgment notwithstanding the verdict) ""motions with a terminology that does not conceal the common 
identity of two motions made at different times in the proceeding."" See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50 advisory committee's note. "
739,15," We note in passing that the plaintiff-appellant in Home Placement Services was challenging the district court's award of 
nominal damages and instead sought damages based on a yardstick analysis; the appeals court upheld the nominal damages 
finding because the evidence was ""not 'sufficient to get the Court beyond the guessing stage.'"" Id. at 1209 (quoting William 
Goldman Theatres, Inc. v. Loew's, Inc., 69 F. Supp. 103, 106 (E.D. Pa. 1946), aff'd, 164 F.2d 1021, 1022 (3d Cir. 1947), cert. 
denied, 334 U.S. 811, 92 L. Ed. 1742, 68 S. Ct. 1016 (1948))."
739,16," We understand the difficult choice that the district court faced. As a practical matter, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for a 
juror to segregate antitrust damages due to a monopolization offense but not due to illegal price discrimination from antitrust 
damages due only to price discrimination, where as here, the facts and conduct involved in both allegations greatly overlap. "
741,17," Rule 26's schedule concerning the duty to disclose information concerning expert witnesses and their opinions may be altered 
by the court. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(C) (setting forth schedule of disclosure of expert testimony ""in the absence of other 
directions from the court or stipulation by the parties""). "
742,18," At one point in the oral argument over Coastal's motion in limine to exclude Dr. Freyre and Dr. Gutierrez, the court asked ""And 
when are you going to bring them?"" To this question, counsel for CAPECO directly responded, ""We are going to use [them] in 
our case [in] chief."" "
747,1," Ortho's motion for a preliminary injunction, filed shortly after this action was filed, was denied by Judge Sand. Ortho Diagnostic

749,5," ""PX"" refers to exhibits contained in the exhibit binders to Ortho's memorandum of law in opposition to Abbott's motion for 
summary judgment."
749,6," Ortho complains also of the so-called technology bridge clause, paragraph 13, which provides in substance that CCBC 
members committed to buying Abbott's assays could switch to a ""next generation"" test developed by a competitor until sixty days 
after Abbott developed its own equivalent, that Abbott would offset the difference in price between Abbott's older test and the 
new competitive test for a period of six months, and that Abbott would provide microtiter equipment (if needed for use with the 
new test) at no extra charge. Ortho, however, has made no serious effort to show that this provision violates the antitrust laws. In 
consequence, there is no need to address it further. "
750,7," The contract provided five cent per test increments and decrements to the prices in the table for HCV and Anti-core for volumes 
less and greater, respectively, than set forth in an attached schedule."
750,8," Although Ortho does not manufacture all five assays, Ortho was able at the time of the CCBC bid and subsequently to arrange 
for provision of all five tests by working in conjunction with a complementary manufacturer. (Abbott Br. at 4, n.1; Goldstein Dep. 
607-08) "
751,9," Abbott's Rule 3(g) statement asserts that Ortho's CCBC contracts, as of the date of the filing of Abbott's motion, were 
profitable. (Abbott Statement Pursuant to Local Rule 3(g), P 27) Ortho's response admits that its sales to CCBC customers ""are 
generally profitable."" It seeks to diminish the impact of that admission by contending that the majority of those customers as of 
the relevant date were not subject to Abbott's CCBC contract. (Ortho Statement Pursuant to Local Rule 3(g), P 27) "
752,," Nevertheless, Ortho does not contend that even those contracts into which it entered with CCBC members after the Abbott-
CCBC contract became effective are unprofitable for Ortho."
752,10," Michels Dep. 437, 544; Skillman Dep. 28; Ballish Dep. 75. "
753,11," According to Abbott, Abbott's post-Red Cross contract shares of markets consisting of purchases by BDCs (the view of the 
market definition most favorable to Ortho) would be as follows: HCV - 30.6%, HTLV - 46.5%, HBsAg - 37%, and Anti-core - 
34.3%. (Wistar Decl. P 6) "
754,12," Abbott relies on Nifty Foods Corp. v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 614 F.2d 832 (2d Cir. 1980), and Caldwell v. Am. Basketball 
Ass'n, 825 F. Supp. 558 (S.D.N.Y. 1993), aff'd without consideration of the point, 66 F.3d 523 (2d Cir. 1995), for the proposition 
that the decline in Abbott's market share projected to result from Ortho's capture of the Red Cross contract requires, as a matter 
of law, the conclusion that Abbott lacks market power in any of the assay markets. The argument is unpersuasive. Nifty Foods held that a plaintiff claiming attempted monopolization failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to a 
defendant's alleged probability of successful monopolization where it relied solely upon the defendant's market share, which had 
declined from 54.5 to 33 percent in the years immediately following the conduct complained of. The case does not control here 
because Abbott does not even contend that the Red Cross contract would reduce its share of the HIV-1/2 market below its 90 
percent-plus level. Moreover, the Nifty Foods court dealt with a five year history of actual market performance whereas Abbott 
asks this Court to dismiss Ortho's case on the basis of a projection as to the likely future effect of the Red Cross contract. 
Caldwell is less supportive of Abbott's position because Judge Sand there held only that the American Basketball Association 
could not be regarded as having held monopoly power in the market for professional basketball players' services in view of its 
collapse two years after the conduct in question. While both cases support reference to post-conduct events in the marketplace, 
as well as market shares, in determining the existence of market power, both are fact specific and neither is dispositive of the 
issue at bar."
754,13," Berkey's leveraging theory has been rejected by the Ninth Circuit.  Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. United States, 948 F.2d 536, 548 
(9th Cir. 1991). Other courts have reserved judgment. See, e.g., Advanced Health-Care Serv. v. Radford Comm. Hosp., 910 
F.2d 139, 149 n.17 (4th Cir. 1990); Ass'n for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women v. NCAA, 236 U.S. App. D.C. 311, 735 F.2d 
577, 586 n.14 (D.C. Cir. 1984). This Court, however, is bound by Berkey. "
756,14," The authors of ANTITRUST LAW argue that package pricing is not predatory as long as the price of the package exceeds the 
relevant cost of the package. Id. P 1758f, at 352. The analysis leading to this conclusion, however, presupposes that the 
defendant lacks market power in any of the products comprising the package. Rivals, they reason, cannot be heard to complain; 
they simply will be driven to offer similar packages or discount their own tying product prices. Id. & n. 52. Where, as here, the 
defendant has market power in the tying product, this alternative is not a realistic option and this analysis seems inapt."
756,15," In arguing for a fully distributed rather than an average variable cost standard, the plaintiff in Northeastern Telephone did rely 
on the fact that the defendant was a multi-product firm. But its contention was that the defendant ""would subsidize its losses with 
profits earned in other areas of its business"" and this warranted a test of predation more stringent than average variable cost. 
651 F.2d at 88-89. This does not resolve whether a test other than average variable cost is appropriate for determining whether 
the pricing of a package of products is predatory. "
757,16," The parties have expended a good deal of energy in debating whether Ortho's claim is properly characterized as one of 
predatory pricing. As indicated above, Ortho must adduce evidence sufficient to ground a conclusion that the pricing should be 
condemned, whatever adjective may be applied. In the Court's view, the standard discussed in the text -- pricing that could drive 
a more efficient competitor from the marketplace -- is that which separates legitimate from illegitimate competition. Whether such 
behavior is characterized as ""predatory"" is quite beside the point. If it transgresses that standard, it satisfies the conduct element 
of monopolization, attempted monopolization and leveraging and will be unlawful if the other elements of those claims are met."
757,17," Although Keflin and Keflax were patented, all of the cephalosporins were interchangeable for some uses. The patents 
themselves, as frequently is the case, did not confer market power. The SmithKline courts regarded the market as including the

759,20, See notes 9-10 supra.
759,21," More specifically, he stated that Abbott priced HCV and Anti-core together at $ 3.75 in the five assay package, which 
exceeded Abbott's combined marginal cost of $ 1.49 for those two products by $ 2.26. He then reasoned that Abbott had to 
forgo $ 1.62 in the added revenue it presumably would have obtained from sales of HIV, HTLV and HBsAg had it sold those 
assays at the higher, unbundled prices. Treating that presumptively forgone revenue as a cost of selling the HCV and Anti-core 
at the bundled prices would reduce the nominal profit on HCV and Anti-core to $ 0.64. (Ordover Dep. 95-147) Even this profit is 
said to disappear when the costs of providing Abbott's DMS to five assay buyers are taking into consideration. (Id. 112-22, 132-
47) "
760,22," The standard under the two statutes is identical. Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 23 n.39, 80 L. Ed. 2d 
2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 (1984)."
760,23," Professor Areeda has argued that this standard is ""too extreme."" X ANTITRUST LAW P1758b, at 345-46. He nevertheless 
urged caution in finding a tie on the basis of package pricing and proposed a presumption that there is no tie where ""separate 
sales,"" i.e., sales outside the package, equal or exceed ten percent. Id. As Ortho has offered no evidence to suggest that this 
condition is not satisfied here, there is no need to address the legal standard in this case."
760,24," The price the Red Cross agreed to pay Abbott in 1994 for HIV further reinforces the conclusion that the $ 2.47 unbundled price 
in the CCBC contract was not so high as effectively to force CCBC members to take the package. "
761,25," It is worth noting too that Ortho's tying claim sounds especially hollow. The combined unbundled price of Abbott's HIV-1/2 and 
HTLV is $ 4.04. As its package price for all five tests is $ 7.37, Ortho could sell its three competitive assays competitively with 
the Abbott package at a combined price of $ 3.33, which admittedly is above its cost. Hence, Ortho in substance seeks relief 
under the antitrust laws for business lost as a result of its own refusal to lower its prices sufficiently to meet the competition."
761,26," HN8[
] Tying may violate Section 2 of the Sherman Act as well as Section 1 of the Sherman Act and Section 3 of the Clayton Act if the defendant has either the requisite power in the market for the tying product or a dangerous probability of acquiring 
market power in the market for the tied product. IX ANTITRUST LAW P 1702, at 31. Accordingly, the analysis of the alleged 
DMS tie-in is the same under all three statutes except that (1) the monopoly leveraging claim requires a higher level of market 
power than the Section 1 and Clayton Act claims and (2) the determination whether Abbott had a dangerous probability of 
success in monopolizing the markets for the tied products, the assays, is unique to the Section 2 claims."
761,27," Coercion is an essential element of a tying claim in this circuit. See, e.g., Suburban Propane v. Proctor, 953 F.2d 780, 789 (2d 
Cir. 1992). "
763,28," Even if the market were limited to CCBC members who use DMS, Abbott's precise share would be indeterminate because the 
record does not disclose non-Abbott DMS use by those CCBC members who use a different system. The range necessarily 
would be between 59.6 or 67.3 percent, at the low end, depending upon whether the four CCBC members who use the Abbott 
DMS only as a file server are included, and 100 percent at the high end, as Abbott would account for 31 to 35 systems out of a 
universe no larger than 52 and as small as 31 or 35. This, however, would be an unduly restrictive view of the market because it 
would ignore DMS use by non-CCBC members."
763,29," Abbott has not attacked Ortho's claim that it attempted to monopolize assay markets by tying assays to the availability of DMS 
except on the grounds that DMS was separately available and that there was no coercion. Given the Court's finding of genuine 
issues of fact on those points, the motion for summary judgment dismissing this attempted monopolization claim must be denied. "
764,30," To be sure, a statement that a bidder ""assumes"" that X will occur by a date certain can be fraudulent if the bidder in fact does 
not so assume. The fact that the Red Cross was alerted in express terms to the fact that the December 1993 date was an 
assumption bears, however, on the materiality of the statement and on the issues of reliance and causation. "

parties jointly as ""Appellant"" throughout this opinion."
781,2," The Defendant-Appellee physicians who allegedly boycotted Appellant include: obstetrician-gynecologists Hoover, Dakoske, 
Fitz, and Adams, who are associated with the various Defendant-Appellee medical corporations; and perinatologist Holls, who 
was employed directly by Aultman Hospital. For convenience, we refer to these Defendants-Appellees collectively as the 
""OB/GYNs."""
781,3," Neonatologists are physicians who provide care for high-risk ""neonates,"" or newborn children in their first month of life."
781,4," The state classifies hospitals as Level I, II, or III based on their ability to provide maternity and newborn services. Level III 
hospitals provide the most sophisticated neonatology care, and thus are able to treat more babies on-site rather than transferring 
them to other, more advanced facilities. "

to weed out frivolous lawsuits and avoid wasteful trials."" 10A Charles A. Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure, § 2727, at 
35 (Supp. 1994). "
788,6," In addition to arguing that ""rule of reason"" analysis should apply, Appellees deny that the OB/GYNs entered into an 
""agreement"" not to refer patients to Appellant. Rather, they characterize the letter sent by the OB/GYNs to Aultman Hospital on 
June 18, 1985, as reflecting each OB/GYN's independent and individual decision to refer his patients to Dr. Magoon rather than 
Appellant. In the absence of an agreement, Appellees conclude that there can be no antitrust violation. See Lie, 964 F.2d at 568 
(""To establish an antitrust violation, a plaintiff must show a contract, combination, or conspiracy . . . .""). The OB/GYNs also note 
that the letter setting forth their alleged agreement lacked any binding effect; the OB/GYNs apparently were free to further 
modify their individual referral decisions if they so desired. Given our disposition of this case, we need not resolve these issues. "
789,7," Indeed, Dr. Magoon's June 27, 1984, letter to the hospital indicates that, under the terms of her proposed new contract, she 
would be financially indifferent to the method by which patients were referred to her. Under that proposed contract, which 
apparently was not implemented, she would have received a fixed amount of compensation regardless of the number of patients 
referred to her. In the letter, she discusses the cross-coverage agreement only to highlight the fact that its continuation would 
necessitate higher fees, with resulting hardship to patients and adverse public relations for the hospital. Thus, the letter suggests 
that the hospital, but not Dr. Magoon, might have an incentive to seek termination of the cross-coverage agreement. "
790,8," In fact, as noted earlier, it appears that Dr. Magoon saw dissolution of the cross-coverage agreement as a way of avoiding a 
fee increase that would otherwise be required in order to satisfy the terms of her proposed new contract. "
791,9," See, e.g., Lie v. St. Joseph Hosp., 964 F.2d 567, 570 (6th Cir. 1992) (applying rule of reason to a claimed agreement to 
suspend a physician's surgical privileges); BCB Anesthesia Care, Ltd. v. Passavant Memorial Area Hosp. Assoc., 36 F.3d 664, 
667-68 (7th Cir. 1994) (applying rule of reason to an alleged boycott of a group of certified registered nurse anesthetists, and 
citing numerous cases holding that a single hospital's staffing decision does not violate the Sherman Act); Capital Imaging 
Assocs. v. Mohawk Valley Medical Assocs., 996 F.2d 537, 545 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 126 L. Ed. 2d 337, 114 S. Ct. 388 (1993)

F.2d 1213, 1221 (5th Cir. 1991) (applying rule of reason to a physician's claim that he was the target of a campaign by two other 
physicians to discourage referrals to him). "
792,10," Appellees raise two additional arguments in support of summary judgment, neither of which was addressed by the court 
below. First, Appellees appeal to the ""intracorporate conspiracy doctrine,"" which holds that there can be no conspiracy without 
the participation of at least two distinct legal entities. In the context of antitrust claims against a hospital and its staff, the Sixth 
Circuit has invoked this doctrine to find that there can be no antitrust conspiracy ""when the staff as a group makes decisions or 
recommendations for the hospital in areas that do not affect the market in which they compete as individuals."" Nurse Midwifery 
Assocs. v. Hibbett, 918 F.2d 605, 614 (6th Cir. 1990), modified, 927 F.2d 904 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 952 (1991). 
Accordingly, because the neonatology referral decisions by the OB/GYNs in this case do not affect the market in which the 
OB/GYNs compete, Appellees contend that the OB/GYNs were acting as agents of the hospital, and thus were not separate 
legal entities. Of course, this argument appears inconsistent with Appellees' contention that each OB/GYN made an independent 
and individual decision to refer patients to Dr. Magoon. In any event, given our disposition of this case, we need not address this 
issue. Next, Appellees assert that any anticompetitive effects that may have resulted from the alleged referral agreement cannot 
possibly have had any more than a de minimis effect on interstate commerce, and they conclude that this agreement lies beyond 
the scope of the Sherman Act. However, given the Supreme Court's ruling in Summit Health, Ltd. v. Pinhas, 500 U.S. 322, 111 
S. Ct. 1842, 114 L. Ed. 2d 366 (1991), that the Sherman Act's interstate commerce requirement was satisfied by the allegation 
that a single physician was excluded from the Los Angeles market for ophthalmological services, it appears that Appellees' 
argument is without merit.  [***28] "
793,11," We note that Appellant cannot sustain a § 1981 claim based on allegations of discrimination based on her national origin, but 
that § 1981 protects her from discrimination based on her race, ancestry, or ethnic characteristics. See Saint Francis College v. 
Al-Khazraji, 481 U.S. 604, 613, 107 S. Ct. 2022, 2028, 95 L. Ed. 2d 582 (1987). "

Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3."
798,1, The ADI contracts prohibit distributors from selling non-ADI products which substantially compete with ADI's products.
798,2," Maxim asserts that this figure is misleading because it does not account for the fact that Hall-Mark may stop distributing 
Maxim's products if this court rules in favor of ADI. However, the fact remains that even with 58% of the independent distributors 
no longer selling its products, Maxim's sales grew, indicating that Maxim can still reach consumers. "
799,3," Moreover, Maxim's own expert raised considerable doubt whether Maxim has been foreclosed from consumers when he 
testified: A. [ADI]'s customers could switch their business and go elsewhere. They were all able to buy it. Q. So, no customer was in fact, as a practical matter, disabled from buying Maxim product as a result of this clause you're 
saying? A. Correct."
799,4," Maxim's contention that the ADI-distributor contracts may not be terminated without penalty is meritless. Each of the 
agreements state that if the contract is terminated because the distributor sells a competitor's products, ADI will repurchase all of 
the ADI product inventory at the price paid by the distributor. No other damages are permitted under the contract. Furthermore, 
the fact that terminating the agreement will cut off the supply of ADI product is of no import because ""[a] manufacturer of course 
generally has a right to deal, or refuse to deal, with whomever it likes, as long as it does so independently."" Monsanto Co. v.

alleged any actual detrimental competitive effects from the challenged restraint, however."
806,4," Plaintiff's allegations that other similarly situated business have suffered injury as a result of defendants' conduct are 
unsupported. Moreover, even were they supported, they are insufficient to allege injury to competition. See Les Shockley, 884

826,6," In that opinion, the Court granted plaintiffs' motion for judgment on the pleadings as to significant portions of Realty One's 
antitrust counterclaim. Re/Max Int'l, 900 F. Supp. at 171. Realty One indicates in its recent filings its belief that the Court erred in 
that decision. However, Realty One did not file a motion to reconsider the decision, and the Court believes now is not the time to

Judge Learned Hand observed in dictum that ""it is doubtful whether sixty or sixty-four percent would be enough [to constitute a 
monopoly]; and certainly thirty-three percent is not."" Id. at 424. "
831,9," These markets correspond with the markets named in paragraphs 13 and 14 of plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint and in 
paragraphs 14 and 15 of intervening plaintiffs' Third Amended Complaint."
831,10," Dr. Martin admitted that although he had defined relevant markets more than 100 times, he had never fragmented a 
geographic area to this extent. (Depo. of Martin at 717)."
831,11," The FTC report to which Dr. Martin cites was prepared by the FTC's Los Angeles regional office. No mention is made in the 
record whether it reflects local or national trends."
831,12," Dr. Martin said that the Department of Justice merger guidelines stating that a market share in the neighborhood of 40% 
""implies monopoly power"" supports the first part of his definition. (Depo. of Martin at 782). He cited no support for the second 
part of the definition, i.e., that market share must be at least ten percentage points higher than the nearest competitor."
831,13," Cases cited by plaintiffs to support the division into 161 geographic markets are unconvincing. In Thompson v. Metropolitan 
Multi-List, Inc., 934 F.2d 1566 (11th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 903 (1992), plaintiffs argued successfully a geographic 
market for multilist services in Atlanta could be the south side of the city rather than the entire city. Allowing a city the size of 
Atlanta to be split into two (or even several) submarkets is a far cry from allowing a region to be divided into 161 submarkets. 
Plaintiffs also cite S.W. Suburban Bd. of Realtors v. Beverly Area Plan., 830 F.2d 1374 (7th Cir. 1987), but that case merely 
stood for the proposition that a multiple listing service had standing to sue for alleged antitrust violations. It explicitly did not 
address the merits of the complaint. Id. at 1382."
831,14," The fact that a region may be divided into submarkets does not relieve a plaintiff's burden to define markets which correspond 
to commercial reality and are economically significant. This proposition was made clear in White & White, Inc. v. American Hosp. 
Supply Corp., 723 F.2d 495 (6th Cir. 1983): The fundamental error of the district judge in delineating the geographic market . . . was the mistaken premise that the 
standard market tests may be abandoned or ignored and replaced with a less demanding ""submarket test."" Von Kalinowski, 
in his standard treatise . . ., clearly refutes the lower court's supposition: "
832,," This concept, that a relevant submarket may constitute the geographic market for Section 2 purposes, does not, however, 
mean that a new test has been promulgated for determining the relevant geographic market. It merely emphasizes the 
general rule that although the geographic market in some instances may encompass the entire nation, under other 
circumstances it may be a much smaller area, i.e., a relevant submarket. Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulation § 8.012, at 8-27 (footnotes omitted). Accordingly, the proper criteria for defining a geographic market is that area in which the seller operates, and to which the 
purchaser can practicably turn for supply. While that area is not ordinarily susceptible to a metes and bounds definition, it is the 
area in which producers effectively compete. White & White, 723 F.2d at 502-03 (citations omitted)."
832,15," Realty One provides statistical evidence indicating that in calendar year 1993, only about 60% of the residential sales in Bay 
Village, Fairview Park, Lakewood, North Olmsted and Westlake (five communities in which Realty One is accused of having 
monopoly power) were from homes listed on NORMLS. "
833,16," The Court's May 10 holding did not address Re/Max NE Ohio because, as a late entrant into the case, it was not the subject of 
a motion for partial summary judgment on the standing issue at that time."
833,17," It is difficult to conceive that Re/Max Int'l and Re/Max NE Ohio misperceived the nature of Court's earlier holding on Re/Max 
Int'l's standing. The Court engaged in an extensive discussion of the standing doctrine and applied the facts of this case to the 
principles of law before concluding Re/Max Int'l could not assert the type of injury meriting standing. The Court also questions plaintiffs' contention that, in attempting to leverage injury in one product market into damages in a 
second market, they are simply asserting what they claimed from the outset in paragraphs 13 and 14 of the Second Amended 
Complaint. Paragraph 14 alleges, ""Defendants' unlawful acts have also occurred in, and have affected, commerce in the 
relevant product market for the recruitment and retention of experienced and knowledgeable residential real estate sales 
agents…"" (emphasis added). For Re/Max to now argue that it ""has never asserted a claim that [defendants have] monopolized 
or attempted to monopolize any agent market"" (Response Memorandum, Docket No. 330, at 16) is disingenuous. In any event, the Court finds the purported leveraging claim unpersuasive. Plaintiffs correctly point out that they need not show 
that defendants have monopoly power in the ""leveraged"" market, i.e. the agent market.  Kerasotes Mich. Theatres v. National 
Amusements, 854 F.2d 135, 137 (6th Cir. 1988). However, they do need to show at least a distortion of the leveraged market as 
a result of monopolization of the original market. See id. (quoting Berkey Photo, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 603 F.2d 263, 275 
(2d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1093, 62 L. Ed. 2d 783, 100 S. Ct. 1061 (1980)). This they have failed to do in other than 
broad, conclusory fashion. Finally, even if plaintiffs' argument had merit, it is late in the game for Re/Max Int'l and Re/Max NE 
Ohio to frame a claim for leveraging a monopolistic practice in one market into a claim for damages in another market when they 
have not clearly asserted it in the two years this case has been ongoing."
833,18, There is no evidence of the respective parties' shares in the market for recruiting and retaining real estate agents. 
834,19, See discussion at pages 15-16 supra. 
835,20," According to its origin pleading, Zames Realty (apparently now known as Re/Max Specialists in Real Estate) is located in 
Mentor. REP's location was not stated in its original pleading. Plaintiffs do not dispute Realty One's statement that REP's office 
is located in Broadview Heights."
835,21," True Partnership might argue that the 50.6% figure in Bay Village takes that community out of the Langenderfer presumption, 
which found substantial merit in a presumption that market shares ""below 50 or 60 percent"" do not constitute monopoly power. 
This Court does not find that edging over the 50% level justifies evaluating True Partnership's claim by a different standard. 
Moreover, Dr. Martin's statistics for Bay Village are particularly suspect because his figures were based on the years 1993 
through 1995. True Partnership went out of business prior to 1993. Thus there is no evidence of Realty One's market share 
when True Partnership was competing in the geographic area."
835,22," Any claim that the alleged anticompetitive activity of the defendants produced barriers to entering the real estate field rings 
hollow in light of the fact that most of the plaintiff franchisees were formed after the alleged anticompetitive activity began in 
1987. "
837,23," in the same multidefendant case, the Sixth Circuit held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying summary 
judgment to two defendant hospitals which were pursuing an interlocutory appeal. The district court based its denial of summary 
judgment upon the plaintiffs' showing of issues of material fact that 1) the hospitals' business activities constituted parallel 
conduct; 2) the hospitals had a motivation to enter into a conspiracy; and 3) the actions taken were contrary to the hospitals' 
individual economic interests. Nurse Midwifery Associates v. Hibbett, 689 F. Supp. 799, 808-09 (M.D.Tenn. 1988), aff'd in

838,24," Realty One sent a letter to multiple listing service members in December 1992 announcing that it was adopting the practice of 
""buyer agency."" It announced that it was changing its prior policy of providing a lesser commission split on its listed property to 
brokers serving as buyer's agents than it provided to brokers serving as seller's agents. However, it added that it would continue 
to impose adverse splits on any agency -- whether its brokers were seller's agents or buyer's agents -- to which it had provided 
written notice of ACS in the past. Plaintiffs contend that the latter information was Realty One's way of informing Smythe Cramer 
that it was continuing its ACS policy on Re/Max franchisees."
838,25," Plaintiffs note that the Vince Aveni, Realty One's chief executive officer, and Lucius McKelvey, Smythe Cramer's chief 
executive officer, were partners in a real estate newspaper. They also were observed conversing privately for several minutes at 
an annual meeting of CAB OR in the spring of 1987 at approximately the time their companies decided to impose the ACS. "
840,26," In recognition of this overwhelming weight of authority, the preliminary draft of the proposed amendments to the Federal Rules 
of Evidence would incorporate the extrinsic evidence requirement. The draft reads: ""The comments of the statement [by a co-
conspirator] may be considered but are not alone sufficient to establish . . . the existence of the conspiracy and the participation 
therein of the declarant and the party against whom the statement is offered."" Rule 801(d)(2), Preliminary Draft of Proposed 
Amendments to the Federal Rules of Evidence."
840,27," The Court does not feel compelled to accept plaintiffs' attempt to stretch the ""smile"" not only into an admission of a conspiracy, 
but an order not to discuss the conspiracy further with anyone in the future. "
841,28," For example, Realty One's right to sell agreement includes this language in its second paragraph: ""Realty One is authorized in 
its sole discretion to determine with which brokers it will cooperate, and the amount of commission that it will offer cooperating 
brokers in the sale of the property. Sellers acknowledge that the commission offered to such cooperating brokers may vary from 
broker to broker."" "
842,29," Although Hahn addressed a contract between an insurer and its insureds, the Court believes the interest of the defendants in 
retaining their agents is as strong as or stronger than the interest of the insurer in retaining its insureds."
842,30," Although ""The Reality"" did not state that Re/Max franchisees did not carry errors and omissions insurance, it did raise the 
issue of legal expenses. The booklet stated: ""As Re/Max does not share in an agent's commission, the franchise likewise will not 
share in an agent's Legal Problem Solving Expenses. National Association of Realtors (NAR) reports that the average lawsuit 
costs $ 6,000 for attorney fees and $ 3,000 for settlement, a total of $ 9,000. Remember, E&O Insurance does not include and 
cover many acts committed by agents. In 1988, Smythe, Cramer Co.'s settlement payments to clients and customers ranged 
from $ 246 to $ 24,000 per occurrence."
842,31," Plaintiffs produced an affidavit from Re/Max Crossroads Realtor Ruth Mather who stated that, while she was an agent for 
Coldwell Banker Hunter Realty and contemplating a change in association, a Realty One officer warned her that Re/Max did not 
carry insurance for its agents. However, Mather joined Re/Max Crossroads despite the alleged warning. Plaintiffs therefore can 
show no pecuniary loss as a result of the alleged disparaging statement to Mather. "
843,32," The Court does not necessarily adhere to Murphy's holding that a claim of disparagement must be set forth with particularity in 
the complaint. See Baxter Travenol Laboratories, Inc. v. LeMay, 93 F.R.D. 379, 381 (S.D.Ohio 1981). However, the claimant 
must provide specifics at some point in the discovery process. Plaintiffs have failed to offer specific statements leading to 
pecuniary damages in this case. "
844,33," Realty One's § 2 conspiracy to monopolize claim was dismissed by the Court in its May 10, 1995 order. Also dismissed were 
portions of Realty One's § 1 claim. Re/Max Int'l, 900 F. Supp. at 170."
844,34, See page 33 supra for a brief discussion on the distinction between the rule of reason and the per se rule. 
845,35," Addressing the counterclaim defendants' argument that it had put forth no evidence of antitrust injury, Realty One appended to 
its answer brief an affidavit of its president, James C. Miller, attempting to articulate some specific harm. Mr. Miller's affidavit 
stated that the alleged conspiracy caused injury 1) by failing to compensate Realty One appropriately when Realty One provides 
greater services than other selling brokers and 2) by preventing Realty One from competing to obtain greater compensation for 
better services than its competitors. The Court finds that these last-minute assertions are little more than conclusory allegations. 
In any event, Realty One (and all other brokers and agents in the market) retain the competitive incentive to achieve the sale. 
Receiving a 50% commission split, which appears to be the average split on the MLS systems, is better than not making the sale 
and receiving no split at all."
845,36," This conclusion renders it unnecessary to address another troubling portion of Realty One's counterclaim: whether Re/Max 
Int'l and Re/Max NE Ohio, as franchisor and subfranchisor, could be considered part of a ""horizontal"" conspiracy. The Court's 
May 10, 1995, memorandum opinion indicated that Re/Max Int'l and Re/Max NE Ohio could be held liable under Realty One's "
846,," cooperative commission conspiracy theory only if they have a horizontal relationship with the franchisees, i.e., if they are 
competitors on the same level of competition. Re/Max Int'l, 900 F. Supp. at 157."
846,37," The Court's May 10 opinion devoted additional analysis to the underlying antitrust sham litigation principles. Re/Max Int'l, 900 
F. Supp. at 159-61."
846,38," Counterclaim defendants point out correctly that four of the counterclaim defendant franchisees were not in existence at the 
time of the filing of four state lawsuits in 1990 and 1991. However, the counterclaim alleges a continuing pattern of instigating 
baseless suits that continues until the present suit, so the newer franchisees do not merit dismissal merely based upon their date 
of entering business."
846,39," Re/Max Int'l claims its position changed in 1992 when it became aware of the direct evidence supplied by Leo Lee. See pages 
40-41 supra. Whether this was Re/Max Int'l's motivation for changing its position, and the bearing, if any, this information would 
have on any role played by Re/Max Int'l in encouraging the 1990 and 1991 suits, are questions of fact not appropriate for 
summary judgment. "
847,40," Realty One has documented in excess of $ 167,000 in legal fees to fight the four prior lawsuits and obviously is incurring a 
bundle of legal fees in the instant case."
847,41," For a general discussion of this business tort, see Section VI.C., supra."
847,42," Realty One apparently believes such activities are tortious in this case because counterclaim defendants' statements that 
Realty One agents would make more money as Re/Max franchisees were ""deceptive and misleading."" (Counterclaim at P23). 
However, Realty One has not offered proof that the statements were deceptive and misleading. And although Realty One 
disputes it, a system offering agents the opportunity to keep 95% to 100% of commissions rather than 50% would appear to 
increase compensation for at least some agents, even taking into consideration franchise-related fees and costs. The two sides 
apparently have a good-faith disagreement on which system best compensates brokers and agents. A statement by either that 
its system is best does not rise to the level of an actionable falsehood. "
849,43," The motion of the plaintiffs for summary judgment against the defendant Realty One on its counterclaim in its count one for

proposition and the court has not found any authority supporting this statement. It appears, as defendant Playmobil argues on 
page 13 of its Opposition to Motion to Remand, that ""the limited scope of the Alabama antitrust statutes, due to the interstate 
nature of most modem commerce, is underscored by the dearth of authority construing the statutes."" "

] In considering a motion for summary 
judgment, a court does not resolve factual disputes or make credibility determinations, and must view the facts and inferences in 
the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.  Big Apple BMW, Inc. v. BMW of North America, Inc., 974 F.2d 1358, 
1363 (3d Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 912, 122 L. Ed. 2d 659, 113 S. Ct. 1262 (1993). "
906,2," As Miramax points out, any theater is equipped to exhibit art films and theaters which are not known as ""art houses"" can and

907,3," For example, the trade screening notice for ""The Crying Game"" was dated December 1, 1992. The notice announced that the 
first Philadelphia run would occur on or about December 18, 1992, invited Philadelphia exhibitors to a December 8, 1992, 
screening, and requested that written offers be submitted no later than 12 noon on December 10, 1992. Zeidman's worksheet, 
which memorialized the clearance given to the Ritz for ""The Crying"" Game, however, had a telefax legend dated November 30, 
1992."
907,4," Orson's amended complaint included allegations of additional anticompetitive practices by Miramax. These allegations were 
abandoned, with the exception of allegations of retaliatory conduct on Miramax's part, which Orson subsequently pursued by 
way of a motion for injunctive relief. See supra, p. 9. In its motion, Orson relied on Bergen Drug Co. v. Parke, Davis & Co., 307 
F.2d 725, 728 (3d Cir. 1962), an antitrust case where we held that a court may grant a preliminary injunction when a party 
engages in conduct calculated to frustrate litigation, and alleged that Miramax's refusal to grant the Roxy any more licenses, 
including a license for a subsequent run on ""Strictly Ballroom"" was retaliatory. The district court denied Orson's motion, finding 
that Miramax's reason for refusing Orson a license on ""Strictly Ballroom"" was not solely retaliatory; that Miramax films were not 
indispensable to Orson's survival; that Orson had delayed asking for preliminary relief; that a preliminary injunction would, under 
the circumstances, be difficult to administer; that Orson's contention that it would be unable to secure witnesses for trial because 
of other theaters' fear of retaliation was speculative; that Orson's alleged harm was compensable in money damages; that the 
preliminary injunction would be oppressive to Miramax; that Orson had not shown that it was likely to succeed on its antitrust 
claims; and that Orson's request for Miramax films exceeded the status quo.  Orson, Inc. v. Miramax Film Corp., 836 F. Supp. 
309 (E.D. Pa. 1993). In this appeal, Orson has also challenged the district court's decision to deny the motion for injunctive relief. This issue, however, 
is moot, in light both of our decision to uphold the court's order granting summary judgment to Miramax on Orson's antitrust 
claims and of the Roxy's cessation of operations."
907,5," Section 203-7 of Pennsylvania's Feature Motion Picture Fair Business Practices Law, 73 P.S. § 203-1 et seq. (the

exclusive multiple first run for more than 42 days without provision to expand the run to second run or subsequent run

federal antitrust law.  Orson, Inc. v. Miramax Film Corp., 862 F. Supp. 1378, 1381 n.3 (E.D. Pa. 1994). Accordingly, the district 
court treated Orson's federal and antitrust claims identically. Id. Likewise, in this appeal, Orson briefs only the federal antitrust 
issues. Further, since Orson had raised, in the district court's view, an issue for summary judgment by arguing in its brief in opposition to 
Miramax's motion that the Miramax-Ritz agreement should be declared illegal per se, the court evaluated the parties' 
submissions as though it had before it cross-motions for summary judgment as to Orson's entire complaint, even though Orson 
had moved expressly for summary judgment on only its Pennsylvania law claims.  Id. at 1382. Orson does not question this 
aspect of the district court's decision on appeal. "
909,7," Section 203-10 of the Pennsylvania Act, which covers the actions that an exhibitor may bring for alleged violations of the Act,

909,8," Since the district court's May 10, 1995 order was a final order, 28 U.S.C. § 1291 gives us appellate jurisdiction over this entire 
case. Thus, our power of review extends not only to that portion of the district court's order which reflects its decision to grant 
summary judgment to Miramax, but to that portion of its order which reflects its decision to deny Orson's cross-motion for 
summary judgment as well.  International Union, United Mine Workers of America v. Racho Trucking Co., 897 F.2d 1248, 1252 
n.2 (3d Cir. 1990). "
910,9," There are certain agreements or practices which ""because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming 
virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise harm they 
have caused or the business excuse for their use."" Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545, 78 
S. Ct. 514 (1958). Such ""plainly anticompetitive"" agreements are ""'illegal per se.'"" National Soc'y of Professional Eng'rs v. United 
States, 435 U.S. 679, 692, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637, 98 S. Ct. 1355 (1978). Horizontal boycotts have received illegal per se treatment.  
Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741, 79 S. Ct. 705 (1959). Although Orson contended in the 
district court that Miramax's relationship with the Ritz was illegal per se, and occasionally speaks of the relationship as a 
""boycott,"" it does not contend in this appeal that the per se rule applies. In addition to the traditional rule of reason and the per se rules, courts sometimes apply what amounts to an abbreviated or 
""quick look"" rule of reason analysis.  United States v. Brown Univ., 5 F.3d 658, 669 (3d Cir. 1993). This abbreviated rule applies 
where per se condemnation is inappropriate, but where a full-blown industry analysis is not required to demonstrate the 
anticompetitive character of an inherently suspect restraint. Id. For example, in cases involving agreements not to compete in 
terms of price or output among members of professional associations, the Supreme Court did not apply a per se analysis, opting 
instead for an abbreviated rule of reason test where ""'no elaborate industry analysis [was] required to demonstrate the 
anticompetitive character of such an agreement.'"" FTC v. Indiana Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 459, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445, 106 S. 
Ct. 2009 (1986)(quoting Professional Eng'rs, 435 U.S. at 692). "
911,," Asserting in its brief that ""the restraint's negative effect on competition is manifest given the abundance of record evidence 
showing that the Miramax-Ritz boycott of the Roxy had the effect of decreasing output and increasing prices in the Center City 
art-film market,"" Orson suggests that an abbreviated rule of reason market analysis should be used here. Orson failed, however, 
to substantiate its assertion with facts. We have stated that arguments made in legal memoranda are not evidence.  Jersey 
Cent. Power & Light Co. v. Township of Lacey, 772 F.2d 1103, 1109-10 (3d Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1013, 89 L. Ed. 2d 
305, 106 S. Ct. 1190 (1986). We, therefore, need not consider Orson's suggestion further."
911,10," In Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977), a television manufacturer 
entered into franchise agreements which prohibited the sale of its products from other than specified locations. Discussing the 
application of the rule of reason to vertical restraints, the Supreme Court explained the difference between interbrand and 
intrabrand competition: Interbrand competition is the competition among the manufacturers of the same generic product -- television sets in this 
case -- and is the primary concern of antitrust law. The extreme example of a deficiency of interbrand competition is "
912,," monopoly, where there is only one manufacturer. In contrast, intrabrand competition is the competition between the 
distributors -- wholesale or retail -- of the product of a particular manufacturer. The degree of intrabrand competition is wholly independent of the level of interbrand competition confronting the 
manufacturer. Thus, there may be fierce intrabrand competition among the distributors of a product produced by a 
monopolist and no intrabrand competition among the distributors of a product produced by a firm in a highly competitive 
industry. But when interbrand competition exists, as it does among television manufacturers, it provides a significant check 
on the exploitation of intrabrand market power because of the ability of consumers to substitute a different brand of the 
same product. Id. at 52 n.19. "
914,11," We do not suggest that allegations concerning the bidding process lack antitrust significance in all contexts. For example, in 
Movie 1 & 2 v. United Artists Communications, 909 F.2d 1245 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1030 (1991) and 502 U.S. 
1039 (1992), the plaintiff, a movie theater, alleged that two competing motion picture exhibitors and 19 national film exhibitors 
participated in an illegal ""split agreement"" in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. In the motion picture industry, a split 
agreement is ""an exhibitor agreement which divides a normally competitive market by allocating films to particular members for 
licensing rights to the films assigned."" Id. at 1248. On summary judgment, the plaintiff submitted evidence which indicated that 
the distributor-defendants refused to receive any bids from the plaintiff for first-run films, that the exhibitor-defendants did not bid 
against one another and that the exhibitor-defendants earned respectively about 96.9% and 69.9% of all revenues in the 
relevant market. Id. at 1251. Under these circumstances, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the plaintiff 
presented a triable issue on its Section 1 claim of a conspiracy to restrain trade in the form of a group boycott through split 
agreements. Id. at 1252."
914,12," The clearances at issue in United States v. Paramount Pictures, 334 U.S. 131, 92 L. Ed. 1260, 68 S. Ct. 915 (1948), involved, 
inter alia, five major defendants which produced motion pictures and their respective subsidiaries or affiliates which distributed 
and exhibited films. The evidence showed that the clearances were not typical, bearing no relation to the competitive factors 
which usually justify them.  Id. at 146. By way of illustration, the Court set forth the following finding of the district court: ""Some licenses granted clearance to sell to all theatres which the exhibitor party to the contract might thereafter own, lease, 
control, manage, or operate against all theatres in the immediate vicinity of the exhibitor's theatre thereafter erected or 
opened. The purpose of this type of clearance agreements was to fix the run and clearance status of any theatre thereafter 
opened not on the basis of its appointments, size, location, and other competitive features normally entering into such 
determination, but rather upon the sole basis of whether it were operated by the exhibitor party to the agreement."" Id. at n.7. "
916,13," Miramax contends that Orson also failed to show that it suffered antitrust injury. Since Orson did not meet its burden of 
presenting sufficient evidence to demonstrate that competition was suppressed, we need not address this issue. We also note that Orson did not allege nor did it present evidence to show that Miramax was a monopolist or that only Miramax 
films constituted the relevant product market. See Tunis Bros. Co. v. Ford Motor Co., 952 F.2d 715, 723 (3d Cir. 1991) (""It is also 
true that a well-defined submarket may constitute a relevant product market and so under certain circumstances a relevant 
product market could consist of one brand of a product, placing intrabrand competition at issue.""), cert. denied, 505 U.S. 1221, 
120 L. Ed. 2d 903, 112 S. Ct. 3034 (1992). We make these points because Orson's antitrust theory frequently seemed premised 
on an analysis of a market which was limited to Miramax's product."
916,14," Believing that Orson is ""apparently contending that section 203-7 compels distributors to terminate a first run at one theater, 
such as the Ritz, after 42 days and open another run at a competing theater, such as the Roxy,"" Miramax argues that, if 
interpreted this way, the Pennsylvania Act would be preempted by the Federal Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. §§ 101-914. Orson, 
however, states in its reply brief that it does not maintain that section 203-7 compels distributors to terminate a first run at one 
theater and appears to argue that section 203-7 would only require that another theater in the relevant geographic area be 
permitted to share in the run after 42 days. In the trade, a first-run ""day and date"" refers to the first-run exhibition of a film by two 
theaters at the same time.  Theatre Enterprises, Inc. v. Paramount Film Distributing Corp., 346 U.S. 537, 539 n.7, 98 L. Ed. 273, 
74 S. Ct. 257 (1954). At any rate, we have already rejected a facial challenge to section 203-7 under the Copyright Act, holding that ""the Act on its 
face contains no threat to the copyrights themselves . . . ."" Associated Film Distribution Corp. v. Thornburgh, 683 F.2d 808, 816 
(3d Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 933, 94 L. Ed. 2d 765, 107 S. Ct. 1573 (1987). See Associated Film Distribution Corp. v. 
Thornburgh, 800 F.2d 369, 377 (3d Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 933, 94 L. Ed. 2d 765, 107 S. Ct. 1573 (1987) (""There 
may be merit to the distributors' argument that the 42-day provision, when construed as limiting the distributors' right to license 
an exclusive run to 42 days, is preempted by the Copyright Act. However, such preemption would be apparent on the face of the 
statute and cannot be reconciled with [our] earlier decision [in Associated Films, 683 F.2d at 816] that the Act is not facially 
invalid under the Copyright Act.""). "
917,15," When a federal district court exercises diversity jurisdiction, it must apply the substantive law as decided by the highest court 
of the state whose law governs the action. See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78, 82 L. Ed. 1188, 58 S. Ct. 817 
(1938); Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Bituminous Casualty Corp., 851 F.2d 98, 100 (3d Cir. 1988). When the state's highest 
court has not addressed the precise question presented, a federal court must predict how the state's highest court would resolve 
the issue.  Borman v. Raymark Indus., Inc., 960 F.2d 327, 331 (3d Cir. 1992). Although not dispositive, decisions of state 
intermediate appellate courts should be accorded significant weight in the absence of an indication that the highest state court 
would rule otherwise. See Rolick v. Collins Pine Co., 925 F.2d 661, 664 (3d Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 973, 122 L. Ed. 2d 
787, 113 S. Ct. 1417 (1993). Our review of the district court's prediction and application of state law is plenary.  Borse v. Piece 
Goods Shop, Inc., 963 F.2d 611, 613 (3d Cir. 1992)."
917,16," We note that the Pennsylvania Act does not define ""geographical area"". The Act, however, defines ""Run"" in section 203-3 as 
""the continuous exhibition of a feature motion picture in a defined geographical area for a specified period of time."" 73 P.S. § 
203-3 (emphasis added). Section 203-7, unlike section 203-3, does not have the word ""defined"" before ""geographical area."" This 
omission does not change our analysis, even though a Pennsylvania rule of statutory construction provides that ""where a section 
of a statute contains a given word, the omission of such word from a similar section of the statute shows a different legislative 
intent."" Commonwealth v. Berryman, 437 Pa. Super. 258, 267, 649 A.2d 961, 965 (1994). This single rule cannot overcome what 
we see as the plain meaning of section 203-7 and the Pennsylvania Legislature's intent in enacting it. "
918,17," Each party is entitled to the costs it incurred on those claims on which it prevailed on appeal. The parties shall notify the 
Clerk's Office if they are unable to resolve this division of costs between themselves. "
926,1," Hundreds of cases involving thousands of retail pharmacy plaintiffs alleging industry-wide antitrust violations have been filed 
throughout the country. Approximately two years ago, these actions were transferred to this Court by the Judicial Panel on 
Multidistrict Litigation for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings."
926,2," The plaintiff class is defined as follows: All persons and entities in the United States who, at any time during the period from October 15, 1989, to the present, purchase 
or purchased prescription brand name drugs directly from any of the defendants. The class excludes defendants; other 
manufacturers of prescription brand name drugs; other wholesalers of prescription brand name drugs; co-conspirators of any of 
the foregoing entities; affiliates, parents, and subsidiaries of any of the foregoing entities; governmental entities; mail order 
pharmacies; health maintenance organizations; hospitals; clinics; and nursing homes."
926,3," As defined in P 3(h) of the Consolidated and Amended Class Action Complaint, ""Prescription Brand Name Drugs"" are ""drugs 
that are sold under the brand name of the Manufacturer rather than the drug's generic name."""
926,4, The Individual Plaintiffs' Robinson-Patman Act claims are not subject to this motion.
926,5," Managed care is a term that refers to Health Maintenance Organizations (""HMOs""), health insurers or managers of employer 
health plans."
926,6," As a result of a settlement agreement which we preliminarily approved on February 15, 1996 the Class Plaintiffs' action has 
been stayed as to the following settling Manufacturer Defendants: Abbott Laboratories (""Abbott""); American Cyanamid Company 
(""Cyanamid""); American Home Products Corporation (""AHP""); Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (""BMS""); Burroughs Wellcome Co. 
(""BW Co."") (now merged into Glaxo Wellcome Inc.); Ciba Geigy Corporation (""Ciba""); Eli Lilly and Company (""Lilly""); Glaxo Inc.

Warner-Lambert Company (""W-L Co."") and Zeneca Inc. (""Zeneca"")."
927,7," The ""discounts"" in issue in this litigation are discounts off of the published wholesale price of the drug involved. Other 
discounting practices in the industry, such as discounts for cash or prompt payment, are not implicated in this case."
927,8," ""Arbitrage"" refers to the simultaneous purchase in one market and sale in another of a security or commodity in hope of making 
a profit on price differences in the different markets. ""Diversion"" refers to the turning aside or alteration of a natural course or 
route. "
928,9," Due to the pending settlement agreement, Class Plaintiffs' filings pertain only to the non-settling Manufacturer Defendants. The 
Individual Plaintiffs, who are not party to any settlement agreement, address the Sherman Act summary judgment motions of all 
of the Manufacturer Defendants. "
931,10," For a detailed discussion on industry-wide resale price maintenance, a.k.a., the charge-back system, see infra at p. 51."
931,11," Of course, parallel conduct standing alone is not enough to prove a conspiracy. Reserve Supply Co. v. Owens-Corning 
Fiberglas Corp., 971 F.2d 37, 50-51 (7th Cir. 1992). Rather, proof of a conspiracy requires parallel behavior plus additional facts 
or circumstances that raise the inference of agreement. Id.; Market Force, 906 F.2d at 1170. "
932,12," See Class Plaintiffs' Response to the Motion of the Wholesaler Defendants for Summary Judgment and to the Legal Principles 
and General Background Facts Submitted by the Manufacturer Defendants (hereinafter ""Class Plaintiffs' Consolidated 
Response""), at 45 n.29; and Individual Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Opposition to Manufacturer Defendants' Consolidated and 
Individual Motions for Summary Judgment (hereinafter ""Individual Plaintiffs' Consolidated Response""), at 40."
932,13," Manufacturer Defendants argue that Sarnat's testimony is not direct evidence of a conspiracy not to offer discounts to 
retailers, for Sarnat is not talking about discounting to retail pharmacies but rather, about manufacturers' selling directly to retail 
pharmacies. The defendants further attack the foundation of Sarnat's observation, pointing out that when asked, Sarnat could 
not remember exactly with whom he spoke."
932,14," The ""attached information"" consisted of two letters sent to pharmacists in Mississippi and Kansas seeking participation in retail 
buying groups formed to obtain contract pricing from manufacturers. "
933,15," In attendance at this meeting were representatives from many named defendants, including: Eli Lilly, Abbott, Pfizer, Glaxo, 
SmithKline, Searle, Marion Merrell Dow, Johnson & Johnson, Zeneca, Warner Lambert, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Bristol Myers 
Squibb, Boehringer Ingelheim and Upjohn. See Independent Plaintiffs' Landgraf Ex. 15 at NPC00849."
933,16," The context to which the author of the memorandum refers is the issue of what would happen if discounting were to spread to 
mail order companies like Medco. "
934,17," The Manufacturer Defendants respond to this document by arguing that the context involved a relationship between an 
advertising agency and Medco. See Pien Dep at 289-96, 370-71. "
935,18," The Supreme Court cautions, however, that if defendants did have a plausible reason to conspire, ambiguous conduct alone 
does not suffice to create a triable issue of conspiracy. Id. Rather, conduct that is as consistent with permissible competition as 
with illegal conspiracy does not, without more, support an inference of conspiracy. Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 
465 U.S. 752, 763-64, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775, 104 S. Ct. 1464 (1984). "
938,19," As indicated above, on February 15, 1996, this court preliminarily approved a settlement agreement between the Class 
Plaintiffs and many of the Manufacturer Defendants. As between the Class Plaintiffs and the settling defendants, no motions for 
summary judgment are here considered. However, given that no settlement has been reached with the Individual Plaintiffs, each 
of the Manufacturer Defendants' motions for summary judgment will be addressed. "
939,20," Among the Manufacturer Defendants making such an argument are American Home Products, American Cyanamid, Bristol 
Myers Squibb, Boehringer Inhelheim, Burroughs Wellcome, G.D. Searle, Glaxo, Hoffmann-La Roche, Johnson & Johnson, Knoll 
Pharmaceuticals, Hoechst Marion Roussel, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Sandoz, Schering Plough, SmithKline Beecham, Upjohn, 
Warner-Lambert, and Zeneca."
939,21," To this end, Burroughs Wellcome states that 50% of its products are single source products, and as to these products, no 
discounts are given to anyone. Eli Lilly maintains that it adhered to a single price policy until 1992. Pfizer asserts that it did not 
offer discounts to anyone on single source drugs until 1992. Hoffmann-La Roche notes that its primary market is hospitals and 
institutional care, not the retailer pharmacies. Other manufacturers make less convincing attempts to distinguish their policies, 
but virtually everyone, including those cited, has to some extent engaged in two-tiered pricing, the chargeback system, and a 
refusal to extend discounts to retail pharmacies. "
947,22," ""Pass-on"" is a process by which an entity in a chain of distribution adjusts its price upward to compensate for an overcharge 
by a prior party in the chain. Comment, The Indirect Purchaser's Right to Sue Under Section 4 of the Clayton Act: Another 
Congressional Response to Illinois Brick, 32 Am.U.L.Rev. 1087, 1087 n.2 (1983). Normally, this occurs when sellers pass on 
costs downward in the chain of distribution from the manufacturer to the ultimate purchaser. Id. However, the reverse can also 
occur. Id. Passing on costs spreads the effect of anticompetitive activity beyond the direct purchaser or seller to all buyers and 
sellers in the chain of distribution. Id. The result is that the ultimate buyer or seller often bears the cost of the overcharge. See 
Note, Scaling the Illinois Brick Wall: The Future of Indirect Purchasers in Antitrust Litigation, 63 Cornell L.Rev. 309, 311 (1978). "
948,23," Indirect purchasers have also sued for treble damages under the ""co-conspirator"" or ""vertical conspiracy"" theory. Under this 
theory, the direct purchaser is alleged to have conspired with the antitrust defendant. See, e.g., Link v. Mercedes-Benz of N. 
Am., 788 F.2d 918, 929 (3d Cir. 1986). Fontana Aviation, Inc. v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 617 F.2d 478 (7th Cir. 1980). Although the 
vertical conspiracy is termed an ""exception"" by most courts, cf., In re Brand Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litigation, 867 F. 
Supp. 1338 (N.D.Ill. 1994) (Illinois Brick does not apply to allegations of vertical conspiracy), technically, the vertical conspiracy 
does not involve pass-on damages because the so-called ""indirect purchaser"" is the party directly injured by the antitrust 
violation.  Arizona v. Shamrock Foods, Co., 729 F.2d 1208, 1211 (9th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1197, 83 L. Ed. 2d 982, 
105 S. Ct. 980 (1985). Although the plaintiffs' have alleged such a conspiracy in the present case, for the reasons stated in this 
opinion, such allegations have not been sufficiently demonstrated. "
962,1, The tenant has not pressed this issue on appeal.
962,2, The trial judge apparently read the complaint as alleging a civil conspiracy. 
963,3, Counsel for the tenant conceded at oral argument that the lease contains no such provision.
963,4," According to the Restatement, (1) HN2[
] A promise to refrain from competition that imposes a restraint that is ancillary to an otherwise valid transaction 
or relationship is unreasonably in restraint of trade if (a) the restraint is greater than is needed to protect the promisee's legitimate interest, or (b) the promisee's need is outweighed by the hardship to the promisor and the likely injury to the public. RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 188 (1) (1979)"
963,5, There is no allegation in the complaint of fraud or duress in the negotiation of the lease. 
964,6," The complaint nowhere explicitly alleges, although it does vaguely imply, that other tenants were permitted to sell anything 
which their leases actually proscribed."
964,7," Old habits die hard in the art and craft of pleading. In Bohn Mfg. Co. v. Hollis, 54 Minn. 223, 55 N.W. 1119 (Minn. 1893), a case 
not so very different from this one, the court stated that the affidavits and brief in behalf of the plaintiff indulge in a great deal of strong, and even exaggerated, assertion, and in 
many words and expressions of very indefinite and illusive meaning, such as ""wreck,"" ""coerce,"" ""extort,"" ""conspiracy,"" 
""monopoly,"" ""drive out of business,"" and the like. This looks very formidable, but in law, as well as in mathematics, it 
simplifies things very much to re- duce them to their lowest terms. Id. 55 N.W. at 1120. The court went on to hold that HN5[
] ""if an act be lawful - one that the party has a legal right to do - the 
fact that he may be actuated by an improper motive does not render it unlawful."" Id. at 1121. The court further stated that ""the 
mere fact that the proposed acts of the defendants would have resulted in plaintiff's loss of gains and profits does not, of itself, 
render those acts unlawful or actionable."" Id. "
965,8,"  HN6[
] Bad motive, by itself, . . . is no tort. Malicious motives make a bad act worse, but they cannot make that a wrong 
which in its own essence is lawful. An act which does not amount to a legal injury cannot be actionable because it is done 
with a bad intent. 3 Cooley on Torts (4th Ed.), § 534, p. 545. Bay City-Abrahams Bros., supra, 375 F. Supp. at 1211 (quoting Krause v. Hartford Accident & Indem. Co., 331 Mich. 19, 49 
N.W.2d 41, 44 (Mich. 1951)) (alteration in original)."
965,9,"  If one does an act which is legal in itself and violates no right of another, the fact that this rightful act is done from bad 
motives or with bad intent toward the person so injured thereby does not give the latter a right of action against the former. Hinrichs, supra, 352 So. 2d at 1131 (quoting Tennessee Coal, Iron & R. Co. v. Kelly, 163 Ala. 348, 50 So. 1008, 1010 (Ala. 
1909))."
965,10,"  The cases are rather numerous which hold that if an act be lawful, no one can claim to be damaged by it because either 
bad faith or even malicious purpose and intent inspired it. The motive with which a lawful act is done, is immaterial. Nullus 
videtur dolo facere qui suo jure utitur. Gans, supra, 2 A.2d at 156. For the reader who prefers maxims to be in English, the italicized language means: ""No one is 
considered to act with guile who uses his own right."" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1068 (6th ed. 1990). "
966,11," In light of our holding that the landlord had the right to enforce the use restriction in the lease, there was neither ""an unlawful 
act, nor a lawful act [done] in an unlawful manner."" See International Underwriters, Inc. v. Boyle, 365 A.2d 779, 784 (D.C. 1976). 
Therefore, we do not reach the question whether, as the trial judge concluded, the defendants lacked the capacity to enter into a 
conspiracy. "
974,1, Farmland is incorporated in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
974,2, This statement of purpose is taken from NYFB's Certificate of Incorporation filed with the State of New York.
974,3," A diversion occurs when a large number of milk producers agree to divert their raw milk from, or refuse to sell their raw milk to, 
regular purchasers (handlers) unless they agree to pay a set price for the milk. "
976,4," Both Farmland and NYFB submitted expert reports on the issue of damages creating numerous issues of fact concerning 
plaintiff's alleged injury. "
977,5," As stated, NYFB also argues that Farmland lacks standing because Farmland's profits were virtually the same in 1987 and 
1988. However, this argument alone is not dispositive of whether Farmland suffered economic injury. Farmland seeks damages 
for what its profits would have been but for the alleged antitrust violations. See Lee-Moore Oil Corp. v. Union Oil Co., 599 F.2d 
1299, 1305 (4th Cir. 1979). In addition, Farmland submitted evidence showing a nine percent drop in Farmland's gross revenue 
from 1987 to 1988, the year of the alleged diversion campaign. Thus, NYFB's argument is unpersuasive."
977,6," There is no dispute in this case that the alleged activities affected interstate commerce. Farmland processes and, as well as 
sells, raw milk and packaged products from Maine to Virginia, and the alleged activities in this case clearly affect interstate 
commerce. Thus, the third element is clearly satisfied in this case. "
978,7," See United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778, 86 S. Ct. 1698 (1966) (eighty-seven percent market share 
constituted monopoly power)."
978,8," For example, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit found that a predatory conspiracy existed where a cooperative was 
involved in a conspiracy to monopolize a milk market through (1) discriminatory pricing, (2) coercive supply disruptions and 
threats of similar conduct, (3) bad faith harassment and threats of litigation against independent buyer's of a cooperative's milk, 
and (4) refusals to acknowledge or honor termination notices from members. Alexander v. National Farmers Org., 687 F.2d "
979,1173," , 1193-1208 (8th Cir. 1982) (conduct was also accompanied by the deliberate suppression and destruction of documents by 
one of the conspirators, something which is also alleged in the case at bar)."
979,9," According to the amicus brief submitted by New York State Senator John R. Kuhl, Chairman of the Senate Agriculture 
Committee, NYFB's 1988 campaign had the support of New York State Government officials. However, this assertion alone is 
insufficient to cloak NYFB's conduct in Parker immunity. "
980,10," The Court notes that the agreements between Farmland and its producers at issue here were individual purchase and sale 
agreements, not formal output or requirements contracts. "
983,1," This court recently held that a two percent gross wage assessment on workers, used to fund a Nevada job targeting program, 
violated the Davis-Bacon Act.  International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 357, AFL-CIO v. Brock, 68 F.3d 1194 (9th 
Cir. 1995). Plaintiffs here, however, are employers, not employees, and do not pay a wage assessment. Therefore, plaintiffs in 
this case do not challenge OJTP as violating the Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. §§ 276a et seq., and we are not called upon to 
consider whether OJTP is similar to the Nevada program in Brock. "
989,1," A written opinion setting forth the Court's reasoning followed on August 2, 1996 (Doc.# 110)."
989,2," Plaintiffs' fee request, which is by definition an interim one, covers the period from the commencement of the litigation through 
October 3 I, 1995. That period was fixed only by the timing of plaintiffs' motion and defendant's objections, and it is not otherwise 
related to significant developments in the course of the litigation."
989,3," This sum represents a blended rate of $ 370 per hour, and it will be divided among counsel as plaintiffs see fit. "
990,4, See counsel's billing records and statements to the Court during the hearing on attorneys' fees.
990,5," On February 13, 1996, the Court denied plaintiffs' request for a permanent injunction in Schreiber (Doc. #37). "
991,6," Because the Court cannot ascertain the subject matter of some of the billing entries in question, it notes that plaintiffs have the 
burden of demonstrating that they are entitled to the fees requested See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437. The NCAA asserts that such 
entries are unrelated to the matters for which the Court is currently awarding fees, and plaintiffs have not offered any contrary 
evidence. Accordingly, for now, the Court groups those entries with the work done on class certification, damages and post-
summary judgment Schreiber. Again, this determination is made without prejudice, and the Court will review such entries in 
connection with any renewed request for fees."
991,7," The Court is confounded by Mr. Roth's request for reimbursement of ""entertainment"" expenses incurred in connection with his 
travel to Kansas City for depositions and status conferences with the Court. The Court cannot conceive of an occasion when 
such expenses would be appropriately shifted to an opposing party, and the Court is not likely to award such expenses in 
connection with any future request. "
992,8," From the clients' perspective, Mr. Roth's unflagging advocacy of their salary interests may ultimately prove to be the most 
financially valuable work by any of the lawyers in this case."
992,9," For example, on May 25, 1995, Mr. Roth billed one hour for drafting ""letters to Coaches (151) regarding 'Good News' -- NCAA 
rescinding compensation provision."" "
998,1," In the Court's July 31, 1995 Order, the Court granted Plaintiff thirty days within which to file an amended complaint. Plaintiff 
apparently served its complaint on August 31, 1995. However, the amended complaint bears a file stamp date of September 7, 
1995, more than a week after Plaintiff was ordered to file its pleading. Although the Court will not dismiss the action on this 
basis, the Court cautions Plaintiff to abide by the Court's orders. Failure to do so in the future will result in the dismissal of this 
action for failure to prosecute pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b). "
999,2," Section 4 of the Clayton Act authorizes suit by any person injured in his business or property. 15 U.S.C. § 15. Plaintiffs must 
demonstrate that they are ""either a consumer of the alleged violator's goods or services or a competitor of the alleged violator in 
the restrained market."" Eagle v. Star-Kist Foods, Inc., 812 F.2d 538, 540 (9th Cir. 1987). The Court agrees with Defendant's 
contention that Plaintiff does not have standing to assert claims based on activities prior to Plaintiff's entry as a competitor of 
Defendant in the restrained markets. The Court dismisses with prejudice Plaintiff's allegations to the extent that they precede 
Plaintiff's entry into the relevant market."
999,3," The Court notes that Plaintiff has had an opportunity to cure the pleading deficiencies identified in the Court's previous order 
and thus cautions Plaintiff that the failure to cure the pleading deficiencies with the Second Amended Complaint may result in 
the dismissal of this action with prejudice. "
1009,1," Fifteen dairies were originally in this action. Three of the dairies, Hillside Dairy, Meyer Dairy and Coors Dairy, have settled with 
the Plaintiff and were dismissed from the complaint. All of the remaining Defendants joined in this motion. The Court, however, 
recently severed the alleged eastern conspiracies. Accordingly, only Borden, Inc.; Meadow Gold Dairies, Inc. (through its parent, 
Borden, Inc.); Louis Trauth Dairy, Inc.; and David Trauth remain as Defendants in this action. "
1011,2," Ohio's claims under the Valentine act are not time barred. See O.R.C. § 1331.12 (no statute of limitations for claims brought by 
the Ohio Attorney General). Furthermore, HN4[
] the Sherman Act's statute of limitations does not preempt the Valentine Act's 
statute of limitations provision. Pinney Dock and Transport Co. v. Penn Central Corp., 838 F.2d 1445, 1480-82 (6th Cir 1988). "
1014,3," The Court notes that HN11[
] under Ohio law a shareholders may be held liable for the debts of a dissolved corporation to the 
extent of the assets distributed to them. Kesselring Ford, Inc. v. Cann, 68 Ohio App. 2d 131, 427 N.E.2d 785 (1980). "
1017,1, The Clayton Act's prohibition of anti-competitive mergers provides that: 
1018,," No person engaged in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any 
part of the stock or other share capital and no person subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission shall 
acquire the whole or any part of the assets of another person engaged also in commerce or in any activity affecting 
commerce, where in any line of commerce or in any activity affecting commerce in any section of the country, the effect of 
such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly."
1018,15, U.S.C. § 18. 
1019,2," Of course, simply because the defendants might sell ready mix concrete more cheaply does not make the merger illegal. 
Reduced prices may be the product of greater efficiency, not predatory pricing strategies. This is why vertical mergers are 
subject to ""Rule of Reason"" analysis, and not per se rules of illegality. See Eastman Kodak v. Image Technical Services, 504 
U.S. 451, 466-67, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265, 112 S. Ct. 2072 (1992). "
1021,3," The Clayton Act's reach is similarly broad. United States v. Gillies, 851 F.2d 492, 493 (1st Cir. 1988). "
1024,4," Consider, also, the following: A restraint of trade in the building materials market ""necessarily affects"" the price and availability 
of these materials for the construction industry, which necessarily affects ""the volume of … sales and therefore the demand for 
financing and title insurance provided by out-of-state concerns."" Summit Health, 500 U.S. at 322 (quoting McLain, 444 U.S. at 
246). Curiously, given McLain, plaintiff did not plead the factual predicates for this argument. Thus, it is not the basis for the Court's 
decision. Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d § 1350 at 218-19 (motions to dismiss for lack of subject 
matter jurisdiction will be construed broadly and liberally but argumentative inferences favorable to the pleader will not be 
drawn). Nonetheless, the Court has considered this obvious fact in reaching its decision. "
1030,1," We also affirmed the district court's holding that there could be no anti-competitive conspiracy among Sammi and its 
subsidiaries because of their common ownership, and the district court's holding that there was no violation of the California 
Unfair Trade Practices Act. 9 F.3d at 1463-64. "
1031,2," This was the same theory that we declined to consider in Vollrath because it had not been raised before the district court in 
Vollrath."
1031,3," The 1990 amendments only increased the penalty provisions of § 1, and did not change the language quoted above. "
1032,4," See also Power East Ltd. v. Transamerica Delaval, Inc., 558 F. Supp. 47, 49 (S.D.N.Y.) (holding that plaintiff could not bring

1079,7," The ARC America Task Force Report of the American Bar Association, supra, note 5, discusses the different premises 
underlying the federal and state antitrust enforcement approaches. The report observes that a statute authorizing suits by 
indirect purchasers: rests on the premise that federal law does not target its damage awards to the actual victims of anticompetitive conduct. Implicit 
in the state approach is the view that the treble damages remedy is designed primarily to compensate those actually injured by 
antitrust violations and that courts can efficiently trace overcharges and recreate pricing decisions. Adherents of the state view also believe the Supreme Court's concern that indirect purchaser suits dilute the treble damages 
remedy is exaggerated. Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick rest on the notion that direct purchasers will sue antitrust violators when 
given a treble damages remedy unfettered by a pass-on defense. A number of commentators, however, have argued that the 
Illinois Brick rule creates artificial incentives for direct purchaser suits that do not reflect business reality. They note that direct 
purchasers are usually middlemen who stand in a customer-supplier relationship with the wrongdoer, a relationship that is often 
vital to the continued viability of the direct purchaser's business. According to these commentators, few direct purchasers will 
jeopardize this relationship by filing an antitrust claim against the supplier. State indirect purchaser laws seem to follow this 
reasoning. By contrast, the federal enforcement scheme, embodied in Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick, puts primary emphasis on deterring 
antitrust violations rather than compensating victims. Implicit in the federal view is that antitrust law cannot provide full 
compensation for the economic dislocation caused by anticompetitive conduct. Even if the victims are fully reimbursed, the 
economic inefficiencies wrought by the violations persist. Effective deterrence, however, obviates the need for compensation 
and, absent some other market failure, avoids economic inefficiencies that can never be fully redressed. Hanover Shoe and 
Illinois Brick serve the policy of deterrence by insuring recovery and reducing the costs of litigation for direct purchasers -- those 
who are most likely to have information about antitrust violations. Those cases also concentrate potential recovery among a few 
purchasers rather than dividing it among a vast number of plaintiffs whose individual damages are so small that they destroy any 
incentive to sue. They remove the need for antitrust plaintiffs to engage in the complex tracing of overcharges to prove liability. 
Finally, they keep litigation relatively manageable by avoiding multiparty lawsuits with hundreds or perhaps thousands of 
plaintiffs making different claims against the same defendant for the same wrong. Id. 59 Antitrust L.J. at 290-291 (footnotes omitted). In addition, some commentators urge that ""effective private enforcement"" 
may require that ""one or more classes of private litigants be motivated and capable of challenging antitrust violations"" depending 
upon ""the type of antitrust violation and the remedy sought."" Joseph F. Brodley, Antitrust Standing in Merger Cases: Reconciling 
Private Incentives and Public Enforcement Goals, 94 Mich. L. Rev. 1, 21, 22 (1995). "
1080,8," The Tennessee Court of Appeal has ruled that indirect purchasers have standing to maintain an action against infant formula 
manufacturers for alleged price-fixing under the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act, T.C.A. §§ 47-18-101 et seq., a statute 
similar to the Florida DTPA.  Blake v. Abbott Laboratories, Inc., 1996 WL 134947, C.A. No. 03A01-9509-CV-00307 (Tn. App., 
Mar. 27, 1996)."
1080,9," The Florida DTPA, section 501.213, Fla. Stat. (1993), provides in pertinent part: (1) The remedies of this pact are in addition to remedies otherwise available for the same conduct under state or local law. The Antitrust Act, section 542.35, Fla. Stat. (1993) provides: The remedies provided by this Act are cumulative of each other and of existing powers and remedies inherent in the courts."
1080,10," The Texas DTPA cumulative remedy provision provides: The provisions of this subchapter are not exclusive. The remedies provided in this subchapter are in addition to any other 
procedures or remedies provided for in any other law . . . An act or practice that is a violation of law other than this subchapter 
may be made the basis of an action under this subchapter if the act or practice is proscribed by a provision of this subchapter or 
is declared by such other law to be actionable under this subchapter. Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 17.43 (emphasis added). Justice Gonzales, in his concurring opinion in Segura, states that, in Texas 
under section 17.43, either the Texas DTPA must expressly make conduct illegal or another statute must, and refer to the Texas 
DTPA as the source for a cause of action to remedy it. Thus, Justice Gonzales concluded, Texas consumers could not maintain 
a price-fixing cause of action under the Texas DTPA because the Texas DTPA did not expressly make the alleged conduct 
unlawful and the Texas Antitrust Act did not expressly declare the conduct that it proscribes was actionable under the Texas 
DTPA.  Segura, 907 S.W.2d at 513 [Gonzales, J., concurring]. The Texas Antitrust Act cumulative remedy provides: ""The provisions of this Act are cumulative of each other and of any other

1087,1," The Insurance Code does allow a national bank located in a town of 5000 or less people--such as Blackfeet--to register with 
the director in order to transact insurance business in Illinois as an insurance agent, but does not allow such a bank to act as an 
underwriter of the policies. 215 ILCS 5/499.1(a) & (e). "
1088,2," In support of their claim that the Bank Act authorizes the sale of the Retirement CD, plaintiffs offer a letter from the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency (""OCC""), advising Blackfeet that the OCC ""had no objection if [Blackfeet] proceeds with its plans to 
market and offer the Retirement CD."" [Def. App. p. 33]. Importantly, however, the OCC specifically noted that ""state regulatory 
officials may conclude that state insurance laws apply to the Retirement CD."" [Doc. 36, Ex. 8, p.2]. Moreover, in a letter 
responding to concern expressed by John D. Dingell, Chairman of the United States House of Representatives Committee on 
Energy and Commerce, over whether national banks underwriting the Retirement CD would be required to comply with state 
insurance laws, the OCC wrote: In concluding that the Retirement CD represents a bank authorized product, we did not need to address the question of 
whether the bank is authorized to sell or underwrite annuities, or whether annuities are insurance products. . . . State 
regulatory officials may conclude that the state insurance laws also apply to the Retirement CD or any other activity which 
we interpret as being authorized by the National Bank Act. Such a conclusion however, does not affect our interpretation of 
the Act. A state's insurance laws and the National Bank Act are different laws with different purposes behind them. [App. 
200] (emphasis added). "
1090,3," By deferring to the Comptroller's view that the brokering of annuities was an incidental banking power, the Court never reached 
the question of whether Section 92, by negative implication, precludes national banks located in places more populous than 
5000 from brokering insurance--the argument made by the Respondent in NationsBank. "
1091,4," Plaintiffs cite numerous cases and treatises which have distinguished insurance and annuities. See, e.g., Helvering v. Le 
Gierse, 312 U.S. 531, 85 L. Ed. 996, 61 S. Ct. 646 (""Annuities and insurance are opposites; in combination the one neutralizes 
the risk customarily inherent in the other . . . insurance looks to longevity, annuity to transiency.""); 3 C.J.S. Annuities § 3c (""An 
annuity contract is distinguished from an insurance contract in that insurance . . . is an agreement to . . . pay a specified sum on 
the death of the insured or his reaching a certain age, while an annuity is . . . an agreement to pay a specified sum to the 
annuitant annually during life.""); 43 Am. Jur. 2d Insurance § 5 (""[A] company engaged merely in selling annuities does not 
conduct an insurance business.""). Defendant and Amici, on the other hand, provide an equally lengthy list of treatises and cases 
stating that annuities are insurance. See, e.g., New York Life Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, 89 N.H. 21, 192 A. 297 (N.H. 1937) (holding 
that annuities are insurance); Mutual Ben. Life Ins. Co. v. Commonwealth, 227 Mass. 63, 116 N.E. 469 (Mass. 1917) (same); A. 
Fingland Jack, An Introduction to the History of Life Assurance 165 (New York, E.P. Dutton & Co. 1912) (""As it exists in the 
present day . . . the [annuity] contract is certainly life insurance.""); Solomon S. Huebner, Life Insurance 47, 58 (1915) (classifying 
annuities as a ""leading group of life insurance""). The most we can conclude from these long lists of cases and treatises is that 
annuities are not exactly insurance policies, but that the two have multiple similarities. Thus courts and treatise writers have 
stated that the two products are different in some situations, and the same in others. Unfortunately, none of the cases or 
treatises authoritatively answers the question that we must decide: Whether annuities are properly considered ""insurance"" for 
the purposes of the McCarran-Ferguson Act and state regulation. "
1092,5," See, e.g., 215 ILCS 5/124-5/125.24a (regulation of company's investment); 215 ILCS 5/244 (limitations on company's 
expenses); 215 ILCS 5/244.1 (Commissioner action for financial conditions hazardous to policyholders). "
1093,6," Plaintiffs contend that this reference is to ""annuity insurance,"" which they claim is different from a typical annuity. In support of 
their claim they note that ""annuity insurance"" is defined in Black's Law Dictionary (6th ed. 1990) under ""insurance"" as ""an 
insurance contract calling for periodic payments to the insured or annuitant for a stated period or for life."" Plaintiffs interpret this 
definition to include only situations where the beneficiary of a life insurance policy chooses to accept the proceeds of the policy 
in periodic payments as opposed to a lump sum. We do not believe the definition is as limited as plaintiffs suggest, especially 
given that an identical definition is provided for ""annuity policy,"" which is defined under ""annuity."" Black's Law Dictionary (6th ed. 
1990) (""an insurance policy providing for monthly or periodic payments to insured to begin at a fixed date and continue through 
insured's life."") (emphasis added). If anything, these definitional references run counter to plaintiffs' position by demonstrating 
that annuities and insurance are frequently viewed as the same product. "
1095,1," I fully agree with the majority's conclusion that the provisions of the National Bank Act relevant to this case do not ""specifically 
relate[] to the business of insurance"" under section 1012(b) of McCarran-Ferguson. In other words, this case is unlike Barnett "
1096,," Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, 116 S. Ct. 1103 (1996), where the Supreme Court addressed a section of the National 
Bank Act, 12 U.S.C. § 92, which specifically authorizes national banks to sell insurance in towns with populations no greater 
than 5000 people. Not surprisingly, the Court held that this portion of the National Bank Act did ""specifically relate[] to the 
business of insurance."" Id. at 1106. Thus that section ""falls within the scope of [] McCarranFerguson's 'specifically relates' 
exception to its anti-preemption rule."" Id. at 1112-13 (emphasis added). Consequently, that federal insurance provision preempts 
state law to the contrary.  Id. at 1111. Our case involves neither a federal insurance provision nor an exception to the general 
principles of McCarran-Ferguson; it involves defining what ""the business of insurance"" means and what activities it includes."
1096,2," There may still be, however, a supremacy issue. See infra section IV."
1096,3," It should be noted that if this state regulation is not legitimately classified as ""insurance business"" under 215 ILCS 5/121 
(forbidding transaction of ""insurance business"" in Illinois by companies not possessing an Illinois certificate of authority), the 
Illinois Insurance Code does not apply anyway. Other states have held, in various contexts, that annuities are not insurance and 
should not be treated as such. See, e.g., New York State Ass'n of Life Underwriters v. New York State Banking Dep't, 83 N.Y.2d 
353, 632 N.E.2d 876, 881, 610 N.Y.S.2d 470 (N.Y. 1994) (holding that state banks are authorized to sell annuities because ""the 
great weight of authority supports the position that annuities are not insurance""); Cruthers v. Neeld, 14 N.J. 497, 103 A.2d 153 
(N.J. 1954) (holding that refund annuity contracts are not life insurance policies for purposes of inheritance tax); Corporation 
Comm'n v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc'y, 73 Ariz. 171, 239 P.2d 360, 362 (Ariz. 1951) (holding that proceeds from annuity 
sales not subject to state insurance premiums tax because ""annuities are not indemnities for death but are investments for life""). 
The appellee has not provided specific authority (such as a holding by an Illinois court) for the claim that Illinois completely 
prohibits the selling of annuity products by entities other than insurance companies. Yet it is certainly possible that ""insurance 
business"" under the Illinois Insurance Code covers a broader range of activity than ""the business of insurance"" under the federal 
statute, section 1012 of McCarran-Ferguson, and includes all selling of annuities by state entities. Because I would conclude that 
Illinois cannot regulate the selling of the Retirement CD by national banks, however, I do not believe this case forces us to 
determine the scope of ""insurance business"" under Illinois law. Thus I would leave open the possibility that Illinois could forbid 
the selling of annuities by state banks, by defining this activity as ""insurance business,"" though I maintain that it has no power to 
forbid their issuance by national banks, since the National Bank Act apparently allows the practice, see infra section IV, and it is 
not preempted by McCarran-Ferguson.  Cf.  Barnett Bank, 116 S. Ct. at 1111 (noting that 12 U.S.C. § 92 ""grants small town 
national banks authority to sell insurance, whether or not a State grants its own state banks . . . similar approval""). "
1097,4," Exception must be taken to the suggestion in Judge Wood's concurring opinion that this dissent ""makes a number of 
compelling policy arguments,"" supra at 19, since the opinion advances no policy arguments. The conclusion of this dissent, that 
Illinois cannot regulate a national bank's selling of the Retirement CD, is based upon Supreme Court precedent in the insurance 
realm, general insurance treatises, and dictionary evidence--all in an attempt to clarify the meaning of the terms ""insurance"" and 
""the business of insurance."" While it may well be true that certain policy arguments support my position and that the proposed 
result ""would be beneficial to competition as a whole,"" id., the opinion does not invoke such arguments."
1097,5," Although the majority does not actually address this issue, I believe that we must consider the supremacy implications of 
allowing a state agency to regulate a national bank if we are going to resolve this case as the majority does. See infra section IV."
1097,6," The Court defined ""annuities"" as follows: ""Annuities are contracts under which the purchaser makes one or more premium 
payments to the issuer in exchange for a series of payments, which continue either for a fixed period or for the life of the 
purchaser or a designated beneficiary."" NationsBank, 115 S. Ct. at 812. "
1098,7," See supra note 3 (noting some of the state cases concluding that annuities are not ""insurance""). "
1099,8," The Supreme Court has recently reminded us of the importance of looking to ""ordinary English"" when interpreting terms within 
the McCarran-Ferguson Act.  Barnett Bank, 116 S. Ct. at 1111 (referring three times to ""ordinary English"")."
1099,9," The Couch analysis would leave open the possibility, also noted supra at note 3, that a state could define annuities as 
""insurance"" under its own insurance code and thus proscribe their sale by non-insurance company state entities (like state 
banks). "
1100,10," Even variable annuities, under which the amount of payments can vary according to the investment success of the issuer, 
involve an agreed-upon formula for calculating the payments to be made.  VALIC, 359 U.S. 65, 69-72 (1959)."
1100,11," Even the broadest definition of ""insurance"" proposed by C.J.S. would not encompass annuities. According to this broader 
definition, insurance ""denotes a contract by which one party, for a compensation called the 'premium,' assumes particular risks 
of the other party and promises to pay to him or his nominee a certain or ascertainable sum of money on a specified 
contingency."" 44 C.J.S. Insurance § 2(a) (1993). Annuities, however, do not involve ""premiums,"" nor do they involve a payment 
of money at the occurrence of a specified contingency. At best, annuities involve fixed payments until a specified contingency; 
but this does not fall within even the broad definition of ""insurance."" "
1101,12," The Black's Law Dictionary definitions of ""annuity insurance"" and ""annuity policy,"" noted by the majority supra at p. 15, n.6, 
might initially seem to undermine the conclusion that an annuity is not properly characterized as ""insurance."" For while the 
general definitions of ""annuity"" and ""insurance"" in Black's would make these terms mutually exclusive, the reference to the term 
""annuity insurance"" under the main definition of ""insurance"" and the separate definition of ""annuity policy"" do seem to 
contemplate an overlap between insurance and annuities. The definition given by Black's for ""annuity policy"" is as follows: ""An 
insurance policy providing for monthly or periodic payments to insured to begin at fixed date and continue through insured's life.  
Hamilton v. Penn Mut. Life Ins. Co., 196 Miss. 345, 354, 17 So. 2d 278, 280 (1944)."" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 90 (6th ed. 
1990). (Actually, the holding in Hamilton was that annuities are most certainly not life insurance; the court simply found that 
because insurance companies are authorized to issue the policies, they were subject to state insurance laws regulating the 
business of life insurance. 17 So. 2d at 279-80.) And the Black's definition provided for ""annuity insurance,"" which appears in a 
list of nearly 100 types of insurance located within the main definition of ""insurance,"" is nearly equivalent: ""An insurance contract 
calling for periodic payments to the insured or annuitant for a stated period or for life."" BLACK'S LAW at 802. Based on Black's 
more general definitions of ""annuity"" and ""insurance,"" however, it appears that the defining of these terms simply results from the 
fact that insurance companies have long been associated with selling annuities, which they have sometimes termed ""annuity 
insurance"" or ""annuity policies""--""policy"" being a word specifically associated with the insurance industry and used to refer to the 
written insurance contract, as Black's notes in its main definition of ""insurance."" Id. Thus I interpret Black's recognition and 
definition of the terms ""annuity insurance"" and ""annuity policy,"" which are basically oxymorons under my analysis, simply to 
reflect acknowledgement of the loose way in which these terms have sometimes been used (particularly within the insurance 
industry), rather than an indication that annuities can reasonably be classified as a type of insurance. Among the insurance 
treatises I reviewed, all of which contained long lists of the myriad different types of insurance available, I did not find one 
reference to ""annuity insurance."" In my view, the term is simply a misnomer for annuity products that are sold by insurance 
companies. "
1103,13," A ""refund annuity"" is one in which the ""annuitant is assured a specified annual sum during his life, with the further assurance 
that in the event of his premature death there will be paid to his estate an additional amount which represents the difference 
between the purchase price and the amount paid out during annuitant's life."" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 90 (6th ed. 1990); 
see also 3A C.J.S. Annuities § 2 (1973)."
1103,14," In Le Gierse, 312 U.S. 531, 85 L. Ed. 996, 61 S. Ct. 646, the Court was considering whether the proceeds of a particular 
insurance policy, issued jointly with an annuity contract, were includable within the decedent's gross estate for federal estate tax 
purposes. Under the Revenue Act, money ""receivable as insurance"" by beneficiaries of the deceased, up to $ 40,000, could be 
excluded from the decedent's gross estate. The Le Gierse Court found that the annuity contract and the life insurance policy had 
to be considered together and that they ""counteracted each other."" Id. at 540-41. The Court emphasized that the cumulative 
effect of the annuity contract and the insurance contract, which were issued by the same insurance company and would not 
have been issued separately, nullified the ""insurance risk"" that otherwise would have been part of the life insurance contract.  Id. 
at 541 (""In this combination the one neutralizes the risk customarily inherent in the other.""). The Court held that because the 
""insurance risk"" of the life insurance policy was counteracted by the ""investment risk"" of the annuity policy, the proceeds from the 
insurance policy did not qualify for the estate tax ""insurance"" exemption.  Id. at 542 (""Any risk that the [annuity] prepayment 
would earn less than the amount paid to respondent as an annuity was an investment risk similar to the risk assumed by a bank; 
it was not an insurance risk . . . .""). The Court viewed annuities and insurance as opposites: ""From the company's viewpoint, 
insurance looks to longevity, annuity to transiency."" Id. at 541. "
1104,15," The case involved an attempt by the Securities and Exchange Commission to require that variable annuities be registered as 
securities under the Securities Act of 1933. The respondent insurance companies maintained that McCarran-Ferguson applied, 
since several states and the District of Columbia regulated the annuities under their insurance codes. They also claimed that the 
annuities were exempt under the Securities Act itself, which exempts both annuities and insurance, see infra note 18, as well as 
the Investment Company Act. The Court simplified the question at issue to the element shared by all three statutes: ""The 
question common to the exemption provisions of the Securities Act and the Investment Company Act and to § 2(b) of the 
McCarran-Ferguson Act is whether respondents are issuing contracts of insurance."" VALIC, 359 U.S. at 68 (emphasis added). 
Thus the Court considered only whether the variable annuities were ""insurance,"" not whether they qualified under the Securities 
Act exemption for annuities."
1104,16," The Court described the alleged ""mortality risk"" as follows: Each issuer [of the variable annuities] assumes the risk of mortality from the moment the contract is issued. That risk is an 
actuarial prognostication that a certain number of annuitants will survive to specified ages. Even if a substantial number live 
beyond their predicted demise, the company issuing the annuity-- whether it be fixed or variable--is obligated to make the 
annuity payments on the basis of the mortality prediction reflected in the contract. This is the mortality risk . . . . VALIC, 359 U.S. at 70."
1104,17," Despite the Supreme Court's expressed intent not to provide a comprehensive definition of ""insurance"" in VALIC, the majority 
attempts to find in this decision a formula for ""insurance,"" i.e., insurance equals mortality risk + guaranteed return. See supra p. 
12. In addition, the VALIC Court specifically rejected the claim that the ""risk of declining returns in times of depression"" qualified 
as the necessary ""risk in the insurance sense."" 359 U.S. at 71. The Court noted, ""We deal with a more conventional concept of 
risk-bearing when we speak of 'insurance.' "" Id. Thus the majority's reference to a ""decline in the market,"" see supra p. 13, as a 
""risk"" that the Retirement CD protects against, cannot possibly qualify as an ""insurance risk"" that makes the CD ""insurance."" 
Furthermore, with the possible exception of the stock market crash of 1929, ""a decline in the market"" generally does not qualify 
as ""a single, contingent event,"" as suggested by the majority. Id. "
1105,18," The Supreme Court's recent decision in Barnett Bank, 116 S. Ct. 1103, is truly both an insurance case and a banking case, 
since it involves the power of national banks to sell insurance in small towns, despite state statutes to the contrary. See supra 
n.1. Because the focus of the case is on the express authority granted by the National Bank Act--which fits within McCarran-
Ferguson's exception to state law preemption--rather than on whether the national banks were selling ""insurance"" (they clearly 
were), I treat Barnett Bank in Section IV."
1105,19," McCarran-Ferguson exempts the business of insurance from federal antitrust law when that business is already regulated by 
state law: No Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of 
regulating the business of insurance . . . unless such Act specifically relates to the business of insurance: Provided, That 
after June 30, 1948, . . . the Sherman Act, . . . the Clayton Act, and the . . . Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, 
shall be applicable to the business of insurance to the extent that such business is not regulated by State law."
1105,15, U.S.C. § 1012(b).
1105,20," The relevant section exempts the following from the Securities Act of 1933: ""Any insurance or endowment policy or annuity 
contract or optional annuity contract, issued by a corporation subject to the supervision of the insurance commissioner, bank 
commissioner, or any agency or officer performing like functions, of any State or Territory of the United States or the District of "
1106,," Columbia."" 15 U.S.C. § 77c(a)(8). The fact that the Securities Act exempts annuities and insurance separately exemplifies a 
Congressional recognition of their distinct nature."
1106,21," The Seventh Circuit cases are in accord. In N.A.A.C.P. v. American Family Mut. Ins. Co., 978 F.2d 287 (1992), we considered 
application of the federal Fair Housing Act to the insurance industry practice of ""redlining""--charging higher rates or declining to 
write insurance for people who live in particular geographic areas. We held that even though the FHA did not ""specifically relate[] 
to the business of insurance,"" so as to avoid McCarran-Ferguson preemption by state law (i.e., reverse preemption), the FHA did 
not in any way conflict with or displace a state insurance law. Thus we allowed the practice of redlining to be challenged under 
the FHA. We noted, however, that ""if Wisconsin wants to authorize redlining, it need only say so; if it does, any challenge to that 
practice under the auspices of the Fair Housing Act becomes untenable."" Id. at 297. Our decision in Associates in Adolescent 
Psychiatry, S.C. v. Home Life Ins. Co., 941 F.2d 561 (7th Cir. 1991), fits more easily into the categories noted in the text, 
specifically category three. We ""held that the ""Flexible Annuity"" at issue did qualify as an annuity, such that it was exempt from 
the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Although we mentioned in dicta that ""annuities sometimes contain an element 
of insurance"" (since the longer the purchaser lives, the more the seller has to pay), id. at 565, we did not equate annuities and 
life insurance. And since the Securities Act provides separate exemptions for annuities and insurance, we did not have any 
reason to consider whether the annuity at issue could fairly be called ""insurance."""
1106,22," The majority rightly notes that the Fabe Court recognized that this test developed in two cases where the issue at stake was 
whether the antitrust exemption of McCarran-Ferguson applied. The Fabe Court intimated that the category of ""laws enacted for 
the purpose of regulating the business of insurance"" (the first clause of § 1012(b), and the one at stake in Fabe) ""necessarily 
encompasses more than just 'the business of insurance' "" (the second clause of § 1012(b), and the one at stake in Royal Drug 
and Pireno).  113 S. Ct. at 2210. Any such distinction in scope between the two clauses would not affect this case, however, 
since there is no question that the Illinois Insurance Code is a law enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of 
insurance. The only question here is whether Illinois is allowed to apply its insurance code to national banks by calling their 
offering of an annuity product ""the business of insurance."""
1106,23," If the import of the third criterion is to ask the empirical question of whether the practice at issue has been limited to entities 
within the insurance industry, rather than the regulatory question of whether the practice has been legally restricted to only the 
insurance industry, the answer for annuities is that other entities have historically issued them, particularly charitable 
organizations and nonprofit institutions. "
1107,24," The National Securities Court also recognized the danger of attempting to rely on the legislative history of McCarran-Ferguson 
to unravel the significance of the phrase ""the business of insurance."" The Court noted that ""Congress was mainly concerned with 
the relationship between insurance ratemaking and the antitrust laws, and with the power of the States to tax insurance 
companies."" 393 U.S. at 458-59. The Court concluded, ""The debates centered on these issues, and the Committee reports shed 
little light on the meaning of the words 'business of insurance.' "" Id. at 459. The report referred to by the majority, see supra p. 
15, is consistent with the Supreme Court's observation, as it sheds little light on the critical issue. In fact, the entire legislative 
history contains not a single reference to ""annuities"" by any member of Congress or any witness during the debates and 
testimony which resulted in the Act."
1107,25," In the only case to raise the issue, the state insurance law was found to be preempted by a specific provision in the National 
Bank Act--a provision fitting within McCarran-Ferguson's express exception to state control of ""the business of insurance,"" where 
a federal statute ""specifically relates"" to that business. See Barnett Bank, 116 S. Ct. 1103 (discussed infra). Thus there was no 
true conflict between McCarran-Ferguson's grant of limited insurance sovereignty to the states and the power granted national 
banks to sell insurance in small towns."
1107,26," See, e.g., McCullough v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 435-37, 4 L. Ed. 579 (1819) (rejecting state power to tax national 
bank and focussing on national banks as instruments of supreme national government that states have no power to ""retard, 
impede, burden, or in any manner control""); Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 738, 860, 6 L. Ed. 204 
(1824) (reaffirming principles of M'Cullough and noting that national banks are ""created for public and national purposes""). "
1109,27," As explained infra, there is little doubt that the issuing of the Retirement CD falls within the express powers of national banks 
(since the Comptroller of the Currency says that it does and the conclusion is a reasonable one); nor is there any doubt that 
Illinois intends to significantly interfere with this activity, since it wants to forbid it entirely."
1109,28," Even the appellee does not contend that Congress expressly conditioned exercise of the National Bank Act powers to accept 
deposits, enter into contracts, incur liabilities, and fund bank operations--i.e., the powers under which the Retirement CD has 
been authorized by the Comptroller of the Currency, see infra--upon compliance with additional state regulation."
1109,29," I fully agree with the majority that this provision of McCarran-Ferguson was designed ""to protect state [insurance] regulation 
primarily against inadvertent federal intrusion."" Supra p. 17 (quoting Barnett Bank, 116 S. Ct. at 1112 (emphasis in original)). 
The history of McCarranFerguson clearly indicates that Congress passed the Act in order to protect state control of the 
insurance industry against unintentional interference by broad federal statutes, particularly the antitrust laws. See Barnett Bank, 
116 S. Ct. at 1112 (reviewing history). The National Bank Act, however, is not such a statute; and my analysis does not by any "
1110,," means suggest ""applying"" it to the insurance industry. The majority's suggestion, supra p. 17, that protecting national banks who 
want to sell the Retirement CD from state law prohibition of this activity is ""exactly the intrusion"" that the Barnett Bank Court 
warned against, does not accurately reflect either the history of McCarran-Ferguson or the nature of our inquiry in the case at 
hand. This case is about state intrusion into federal banking business, not about federal intrusion into state control of the 
insurance business."
1110,30," The majority portrays my position as being ""that the activities of national banks are simply not subject to state interference, 
regardless of the McCarran-Ferguson Act."" Supra p. 17. I maintain no such thing. For example, I have no doubt that, were it not 
for Section 92, the states could forbid national banks to sell insurance in small towns or that the states can now forbid national 
banks to sell (pure) insurance in towns over 5000 people. Where a national bank is clearly engaged in non-banking, insurance 
activities, which are not specifically authorized by Congress, McCarran-Ferguson does seem to allow state regulation, even to 
the point of prohibition. The difficulty of this case is that Illinois wants to regulate as insurance what the Comptroller of the 
Currency has found to be banking. See infra."
1110,31," While the issue of national bank supremacy seems to arise rather infrequently in this circuit, we have previously recognized 
the import of the issue. In American Sur. Co. of New York v. Baldwin, 90 F.2d 708 (7th Cir. 1937), we stated as follows: National banks are instrumentalities of the federal government created for a public purpose, and, as such, necessarily, 
subject to the paramount authority of the United States. Any attempt by a state to define their duties or to control the 
conduct of their affairs is void if it conflicts with the laws of the national government and either frustrates the purpose of the 
federal legislation, or impairs the efficiency of these agencies of the government to discharge the duties for the performance 
of which they are created. Id. at 709. Such a conclusion of law does not wither and die simply because it has not been relied upon for a long span of years-
-at least not without explanation of the cause and circumstances of its demise. "
1111,32," Subsequently, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has also concluded that the Retirement CD is a ""deposit"" 
under the terms of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. § 1813(l). The FDIC termed the Retirement CD a ""hybrid CD,"" 
which would be insured by the FDIC like other bank deposits, up to a maximum of $ 100,000. The only special limitation on FDIC 
coverage is that annuity payments exceeding the value of the Retirement CD at the maturity date would not be federally insured, 
i.e., if the issuing bank failed while the holder of the Retirement CD was still living, but after the total of the annuity 
disbursements exceeded the account balance as of the maturity date, the FDIC would not continue making the annuity 
payments. The FDIC insisted that banks issuing the Retirement CD make this restriction clear to potential purchasers, and the 
OCC has asserted that it will monitor compliance with this requirement."
1111,33," The OCC also stated: The Retirement CD is clearly a financial product whose primary attributes are grounded in the Bank's expressly authorized 
powers. While somewhat novel in its approach to determining the interest on deposited funds by providing customers, inter 
alia, with a fixed periodic lifetime payment, the Retirement CD nonetheless represents fundamentally a bank authorized 
product."
1111,34," For example, the OCC insisted that any issuing national bank take steps to protect itself against the risk of having to make 
lifetime annuity payments surpassing the value of the invested capital and accrued interest (when a purchaser lives longer than 
expected). Any issuing bank was required to develop a detailed plan for mitigating this risk, possibly through the purchase of 
commercially available annuities. Other conditions were designed to address matters such as the financial stability of the issuing 
banks, accurate accounting, and implementation of adequate product control systems. In addition, the OCC required that an 
opinion on the FDIC insured status of the CD be obtained and that potential customers be accurately informed of the meaning 
and significance of the FDIC's determination. The OCC also addressed specific language within the Retirement CD promotional 
materials, such as use of the term ""guaranteed,"" to ensure that customers not be misled. Many additional conditions were "
1112,," directed to ensuring that potential purchasers are given clear, complete, and accurate information regarding the features and 
risks of the CD. The OCC even required that any issuing banks implement a special training program for all bank personnel who 
would be involved in the marketing of the CD, as well as a monitoring system to ensure compliance with the OCC conditions and 
other applicable laws and to handle customer complaints."
1112,35," He wrote: Our legal analysis and conclusions to date have been limited to a determination of the Bank's authority to conduct the 
business of banking under the National Bank Act. State regulatory officials may conclude that state insurance laws also 
apply to the Retirement CD or any other activity which we interpret as being authorized by the National Bank Act. Such a 
conclusion, however, does not affect our interpretation of that Act. The applicability of any particular state law to the 
Retirement CD will have to be reviewed on a case by case basis. The appellee's attempt to read into this statement some kind of concession by the Comptroller that state insurance laws will 
apply ignores the plain language of the statement. The Comptroller's position was simple: no comment. "
1117,1," PJM is the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, a power pool maintained by an unincorporated association of 
approximately eight member electric utilities, of which PP&L is a member."
1117,2," According to SER, between July, 1989 and July 1994, PP&L curtailed power purchases from SER sixteen times, resulting in an 
aggregate revenue loss to SER of $ 221,630.00. However, from July, 1994 to July 1, 1995, PP&L curtailed power purchases 
from SER eighty-three times, resulting in an aggregate revenue loss to SER of $ 1,635,704.00. (Am. Compl. PP 47-48.)"
1117,3," Specifically, SER alleges that ""PP&L's pattern of illegal curtailments of purchases of electric power from SER and other 
similarly situated qualifying facilities is intended, and serves in fact, to reduce or eliminate competition in the generation and 
distribution of electricity in interstate commerce and, thereby, to enhance and to expand PP&L's existing monopoly, all in 
violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act."" (Am. Compl. P 68.) "
1118,4," Specifically, SER alleges that PP&L's actions constitute ""an attempt to monopolize the electric energy sales market by 
preventing competitors from operating viably within the market."" (Am. Compl. P 72.)"
1118,5," SER correctly argues that its failure to allege current, actual injury to competition is not fatal to its attempted monopolization 
claim. However, in order to state a claim of attempted monopolization, there must be a threat of antitrust injury, which is not 
present in the instant case: HN4[
] ""The offense of attempted monopolization need not cause actual market damage, but need 
merely threaten to produce the type of market damage contemplated in the antitrust laws. The relevant test is whether the 
'dangerous probability of success, ' if it had materialized, would have caused the type of market damage the antitrust laws seek 
to prevent."" Multiflex, Inc. v. Samuel Moore & Co., 709 F.2d 980, 994 (5th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1100, 80 L. Ed. 2d 
126, 104 S. Ct. 1594 (1984)."
1118,6," SER cites Mahone v. Addicks Util. Dist. of Harris County, 836 F.2d 921, (5th Cir. 1988), in support of its argument that it need 
not allege an antitrust injury in a Section 2 claim: By focusing his complaint on monopolization, attempt to monopolize, and conspiracy to monopolize, [the plaintiff] appears 
to be asserting a violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act. . . . Injury to competition is presumed to follow from the conduct 
proscribed by section 2; therefore, proving an injury to competition is not an element of a monopolization-based antitrust 
claim. . . . Since [the plaintiff] would not have to prove an injury to competition to prevail under section 2, it was 
unnecessary for him to support his section 2 claim with an allegation of competitive injury. Id. at 939. However, this court is not persuaded by this language in Mahone for two reasons. First, as discussed previously in 
this opinion, several other courts have held that antitrust injury is a necessary element of a Section 2 claim. City of Anaheim v. 
Southern Cal. Edison Co., 955 F.2d 1373, 1376 (9th Cir. 1992); Syufy Enters. v. American Multicinema, Inc., 793 F.2d 990, 998-
99 (9th Cir. 1986); Chambers Dev. Co. v. Browning-Ferris Indus., 590 F. Supp. 1528, 1542 (W.D. Pa. 1984). In addition, even if 
antitrust injury was not an element of a Sherman Act Section 2 claim, it is important to note that the Mahone court agrees that 
when a private plaintiff brings an action for actual and treble damages under the antitrust laws, as SER has in the instant case, 
(Am. Compl. at 20, PP A-B), the plaintiff must allege antitrust injury: "
1119,," However, [the plaintiff] is using his antitrust claim to recover actual and treble damages--damages which can only be 
recovered through a private civil suit brought pursuant to section 4 of the Clayton Act. . . . Unlike section 2 of the Sherman Act, section 4 of the Clayton Act comes with a specific injury requirement. Explicitly, the 
section permits suits only by those persons ""who shall be injured in [their] business or property by reason of anything 
forbidden in the antitrust laws."" Mahone, 836 F.2d at 939 (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 15)."
1119,7," In fact, SER's own allegations could be construed as demonstrating that PP&L's actions are actually procompetitive: SER 
alleges that it is PP&L's policy to ""curtail[] purchases of electric energy first from independent power producers to whom PP&L 
must pay the highest price for electricity."" (Am. Compl. P 40.) As a matter basic economic theory, the loss of a higher price 
supplier would not tend to chill competition or raise prices to consumers; instead, it would seem likely to produce the opposite 
effect. "
1120,8," A recent opinion in a state court case related to the instant case, Pennsylvania Power & Light Co. v. Schuylkill Energy 
Resources, Inc., No. 95-C-2810, slip op. (Ct. C.P. Lehigh County Apr. 30, 1996), lends support to this conclusion. PP&L filed a 
state court action against SER for breach of contract and fraud, and against SER's affiliated company, Reading Anthracite 
Company (""RAC""), for civil conspiracy. In response, SER filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin PP&L from 
reducing the rate it pays to SER to purchase its energy production. Judge Thomas Wallitsch of the Court of Common Pleas of 
Lehigh County granted the preliminary injunction, stating that ""PP&L violated PURPA and the regulations by not submitting this 
dispute to FERC for its determination."" Id. at 9. Although PP&L may have violated PURPA, this court concludes that SER has 
not stated a claim under federal antitrust laws."
1120,9," Alternately, PP&L argues that the challenged conduct of PP&L is immune from antitrust liability under the state action doctrine. 
The United States Supreme Court, in Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 350-52, 87 L. Ed. 315, 63 S. Ct. 307 (1943), held that HN7[ ] federal antitrust laws were not intended to reach state-regulated anticompetitive activities. In California Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 63 L. Ed. 2d 233, 100 S. Ct. 937 (1980), the Supreme Court established a two-
pronged test to determine when a private party's anticompetitive actions are immune from antitrust liability: (1) the conduct had 
to be performed pursuant to a clearly articulated state policy; and (2) the conduct had to be actively supervised by the state.  Id. 
at 105. To satisfy the first element of the Midcal state-action immunity test, ""a private party acting pursuant to an anticompetitive 
regulatory program need not 'point to a specific, detailed legislative authorization' for its challenged conduct."" TEC Cogeneration 
Inc. v. Florida Power & Light Co., 76 F.3d 1560, 1568 (11th Cir. 1996) (citation omitted). Instead, ""as long as the State as 
sovereign clearly intends to displace competition in a particular field with a regulatory structure, the first prong of the Midcal test 
is satisfied:"" Id. (citation omitted). Pennsylvania's laws regarding public utilities satisfy the first prong of the Midcal test. See, e.g., 
66 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 501(b) (1993) (providing the PUC with broad authority to ""supervise and regulate"" public utilities doing 
business in Pennsylvania); 52 Pa. Code § 57.34 (regulating the relationship between public utilities and QFs); see also TEC "
1121,," Cogeneration Inc., 76 F.3d at 1568 (agreeing with the district court that Florida ""has an obvious and clearly articulated policy to 
displace competition with regulation in the area of power generation and transmission"" because Florida ""has two statutory 
policies regarding power generation and transmission: a policy favoring monopoly power in Florida electric utilities, and a policy 
of encouraging development of Florida cogeneration facilities""). The second prong of the Midcal test requires that the conduct be actively supervised by the state: ""The active supervision prong of the Midcal test requires that state officials have and exercise power to review particular 
anticompetitive acts of private parties and disapprove those that fail to accord with state policy. Absent such a program of 
supervision, there is no realistic assurance that a private party's anticompetitive conduct promotes state policy, rather than 
merely the party's individual interests."" Federal Trade Comm'n v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 504 U.S. 621, 634, 119 L. Ed. 2d 410, 112 S. Ct. 2169 (1992) (citation omitted). In 
Ticor, the Supreme Court held that the unexercised theoretical power of a state regulatory agency to review joint rates set by 
private parties did not meet the ""active state supervision"" requirement: ""The mere potential for state supervision is not an 
adequate substitute for a decision by the State."" Id. at 638. The issue of state action immunity can be decided on a motion to 
dismiss. Euster v. Eagle Downs Racing Ass'n, 677 F.2d 992, 997 (3d Cir.) (""The state action exemption cases clearly indicate 
that this issue involves a question of law . . . . Thus, the question of whether a governmental entity is subject to Sherman Act 
liability has generally been resolved on a motion to dismiss or a summary judgment motion.""), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1022 
(1982). However, this court declines to dismiss this case on the grounds of state action immunity without a factual inquiry to 
determine whether the ""active state supervision"" prong of the Midcal test is satisfied. The need for factual inquiry is especially 
important because the issue of state action immunity is an affirmative defense as to which PP&L bears the burden of proof.

1126,2," The court noted that if the joint venture had market power, it was unclear why that same market power would not have also

1130,1," Cavanaugh and CSI, through Paulits, never executed a written agreement. While it is unclear whether the parties had reached

at a minimum, an oral agreement."
1130,2," According to Cavanaugh, he was presented with an agreement containing a restrictive covenant on the afternoon of his 
resignation, presumably obligating him to forbear from competing with CASCOR for a period of time. However, Cavanaugh

1131,4," The Court has avoided using the term ""standing"" in evaluating plaintiff's claims. The Third Circuit has distinguished antitrust 
injury from antitrust standing in the following manner: A showing of antitrust injury is necessary but not always sufficient to establish antitrust standing. A party may have suffered 
antitrust injury yet not be considered a proper plaintiff for other reasons. It has been suggested that although standing is 
closely related to antitrust injury, the two concepts are distinct. Once antitrust injury has been demonstrated by a causal 
relationship between the harm and the challenged aspect of the alleged violation, standing analysis is employed to search 
for the most effective plaintiff from among those who have suffered loss. However, in the sense that plaintiffs who sustain 
no antitrust injury may not recover, they may be loosely said to lack standing. Some courts and commentators thus have 
treated Brunswick as a standing case, although its concerns actually centered on antitrust injury. "

he qualified as a ""nascent"" firm, or a new entrant, who would have entered the market had defendants' antitrust violation not kept 
him out: The nascent firm acquires standing by proving that it has the financial ability to enter the market, the background and 
experience that makes success possible, and that it has undertaken such significant steps toward entry as . . . contracts 
with prospective customers, or substantial marketing expenditures. . . . But without such contracts or other demonstrations 
of the ability to enter, standing will be denied. . . . Similarly denied standing for insufficient preparedness was the plaintiff 
who had not produced cash flow estimates or could not support the contemplated entry. Phillip Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law § 374, at 294 (rev. ed. 1995). Cavanaugh has not demonstrated that he had the financial ability to enter the market, since the start-up venture in the warranty 
recovery services market was funded entirely by CSI. Cavanaugh merely had an option of purchasing the venture from CSI, 
subject to numerous future conditions. Moreover, the submission of one bid by Cavanaugh on behalf of CSI could not be 
deemed a significant step toward Cavanaugh's entry into the market. "
1133,6," To the extent plaintiff is claiming that defendants conspired with CSI, who is not a named defendant, the result is the same. 
Such a conspiracy would not have resulted in antitrust injury to plaintiff. Again, plaintiff's losses were caused by the termination 
of his employment with CSI. Therefore, this, too, is insufficient as a matter of law to establish a federal antitrust violation. "

1137,4," The Agreements' stated fee was $ 55.00 ""per unit"", which is defined as 15 minutes. Plainview Anesthesiologists' proposed 25% 
discount would have reduced its regular $ 80.00 fee per unit to $ 64.00 per unit. It is worth noting that the fee per unit provision 
was among the various modifications proposed by Plainview Anesthesiologists to Aetna's standard Agreement. In its proposal, 
Plainview Anesthesiologists tried to negotiate for a $ 65.00 per unit reimbursement fee. "
1138,5," With one notable exception: Unlike Rockville's and Plainview Anesthesiologists' proposals, Atlantic did request that Aetna's 
termination-without-cause provision be deleted. Atlantic proposed that the Agreement be terminated only at the end of the 
contract term. "
1140,6," Some of the other proposed modifications to the Agreements included a higher reimbursement fee and an enlarged period of 
time (from 90 to a minimum of 180 days) for submitting a claim to Aetna. With respect to the latter proposal, plaintiffs also 
requested that If reimbursement is dilatory (exceeds thirty (30) days), the physician's usual and customary charge, not the fee schedule 
rate, should be deemed fair value and paid together with a 1 1/2% monthly late interest penalty from the date of claim 
submission. Plaintiffs also proposed that Aetna take reinsurance in case of insolvency to safeguard physicians' claims against Aetna. None 
of these proposed modifications appears to serve the purpose of preserving the plaintiffs' independent judgment and ability to 
provide quality patient care, at least in the sense that plaintiffs contend the termination, amendment, and dispute resolutions 
provisions do. "
1141,7,"  Plaintiffs in their Brief opposing the motion argue: This is a case about physicians trying to attract business from patients by 
offering better service and better quality care. . . . Not all medical services are fungible. One doctor is often more skillful or experienced than the next; . . . or provides many 
other differences in treatment that will lead patients to prefer this doctor over that one. The physician may also be a more 
aggressive advocate with the HMO for needed care for his or her patients. . . . When price is uniform, these elements 
become the stuff of competition between physicians. Restraint of product competition is what this case is all about. (Emphasis in original.) "
1142,8," Thus, radiologists were prevented from billing patients (or their medical insurance plans) separately on a fee-for-service basis. "
1143,9," The exhibits attached to the Complaint make clear that it was Aetna's policy not to bargain for individual physician participation 
agreements; nowhere is it alleged that the Hospitals were involved in the drafting of the terms of the Agreements. It would appear that plaintiffs' antitrust theory relies on Aetna's influence over the Hospitals to show that Aetna has market power 
in the industry. The presence of market power, however, did not change the Kartell Court's analysis. In Kartell, it was 
acknowledged that Blue Shield provided insurance coverage to 74% of Massachusetts residents who privately insured against 
health costs.  Kartell, 749 F.2d at 924. The First Circuit's decision was unaffected by its assumption that Blue Shield had market 
power. Id. at 927-29."
1143,10," Plaintiffs cite Brader v. Allegheny Gen. Hosp., 64 F.3d 869 (3d Cir. 1995), for the proposition that ""the existence of an 'antitrust 
injury' is not typically resolved through motions to dismiss."" Id. at 876. In Brader, the plaintiff physician had lost various staff 
privileges with the defendant hospital. His antitrust claim alleged that defendants' activities prevented him and others from 
engaging in the practice of general vascular trauma surgery, restraining his ability to compete with defendants. Brader, therefore, 
involves a claim by a competitor that its competitors have engaged in collusive behavior (i.e., exclusion from the market) in 
restraint of competition. The key inquiry, therefore, was whether competition in the relevant market was, in fact, affected; it was 
this inquiry which the Third Circuit found required discovery, id., and was not subject to a motion to dismiss. In the instant case, 
the issue is not whether there was in fact a restraint in competition; rather, it is whether the restraint alleged, even if true, is an 
""'injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent.'"" Balaklaw, 14 F.3d at 797 (quoting Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 489)."
1143,11," See Columbia Note, supra note 1, at 1674-75, 1677 n.17. "
1152,1," No Fear cites the payment history of several batches which are reflective of this allegation. For example, the majority of the 
invoice amount of Batch 3, an order for $ 31,553.54, was paid 17 days after expiration of the 60-day payment terms, with the 
balance of the amount paid nearly six months late. In addition, No Fear points to Batch 8, an order for $ 56,187.00, for which 
partial payment was made 21 days late, with another portion paid 36 days late. Other examples cited include Batch 4 ($ 
7,208.70) which was paid 15 days late, and Batch 5 ($ 2,8561.18), which had payments extending to nearly three months late."
1152,2," For example, Sportmart cites to Maurice's, a Midwest sporting goods distributor, which owed No Fear about $ 250,000, all in 
excess of 90 days due; Tri North Department Stores had large outstanding balance for over 60 days; J.C. Penney's owed over $ 
60,000 which was 60 days overdue; Dick's had an account receivable balance of over $ 50,000 which was 90 days due; and 
Burdine's owed $ 19,000 over days. According to the deposition testimony of Luckham, all of these late-payers remain No Fear 
customers. "
1154,3," Though Monsanto specifically dealt with a situation on a motion for a directed verdict, its analysis has been routinely applied to 
the summary judgment context. Magid Mfg. Co. v. U.S.D. Corp., 654 F. Supp. 325, 332 (N.D.Ill. 1987); see Matsushita, 475 U.S. 
at 588 (citing Monsanto standard as applicable to summary judgment or directed verdict context)."
1154,4," To illustrate the flaw in No Fear's logic, it is helpful to consider the analogous situation of the formation of a contract. Assume 
that the issue is whether parties X and Y had formed a contract, with party Y denying its existence. If there is evidence that party 
Y had admitted the existence of the contract, this would support a reasonable inference that such a contract in fact existed. Even 
if there were no direct evidence of the explicit offer and acceptance creating the contract, this would not prevent this issue from 
being determined by a jury. "
1155,5," It should be noted that the Court finds the additional evidence, beyond the existence of complaints about price from other 
distributors, which ultimately supported the inference of conspiracy in Monsanto is not as compelling as the direct evidence of 
agreement in the instant case. "
1159,6," Sportmart disputes No Fear's portrayal of the facts for each of these incidents. However, since No Fear's argument on this 
issue is unpersuasive, it is unnecessary to analyze the facts in any further detail. "
1160,7," In Monsanto, several amici and the Solicitor General urged the Court to reexamine the applicability of the per se standard to 
vertical price fixing cases. Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 761 n.7. However, noting that the parties had not raised the issue and that the 
jury decision had been based on the per se standard, the Court declined to reach this question. Id. "
1165,*," This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 
9th Cir. R. 36-3."
1165,1," Appellant principally argues that because the City exercised the power delegated to it by the state in a way that violated the 
City's charter, the City exceeded the scope of the state's vehicle removal and storage authorization. Appellant's focus on the 
City's charter is misguided. While Metro's allegation that the City violated its own charter must be accepted as true, it is well-
settled that HN3[
] the mere fact that conduct violates state law does not strip a municipality of state action immunity. See, e.g., City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 499 U.S. 365, 371-72, 113 L. Ed. 2d 382, 111 S. Ct. 1344 (1991); Lancaster, 
940 F.2d at 402 & n.10; Traweek, 920 F.2d at 593; Boone v. Redevelopment Agency of San Jose, 841 F.2d 886, 892 (9th 
Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 965, 102 L. Ed. 2d 526, 109 S. Ct. 489 (1988); cf.  Tri-State Rubbish, Inc. v. Waste Management, 
Inc., 998 F.2d 1073, 1077 (1st Cir. 1993). Of course, appellant may attack the City's violation of its charter other than through the Sherman Act. We have emphasized that 
principles of federalism and state sovereignty require that state law and not federal antitrust law remain the remedy for claims 
that state or city officials exceeded their authority under state law. See, e.g., Boone, 841 F.2d at 891 - 92. "
1171,1," In support of its Motion to Dismiss, the Township provides a volume of documents as an appendix, and argues that the volume 
should be admitted as evidence for purposes of deciding the Motions to Dismiss. See Township's Motion to Dismiss at 19-21; 
Township's Reply Brief at 2-3. I decline, however, to admit the appendix as substantive evidence, and will decide the issues 
according to the facts as presented by Barnes in its Amended Complaint and Barnes' Response to the Motions to Dismiss."
1171,2," There is some issue as to whether or not a conspiracy claim can proceed if one or several of the conspirators are dismissed 
from the action. Barnes has cited to Dennis v. Sparks, 449 U.S. 24, 66 L. Ed. 2d 185, 101 S. Ct. 183 (1980) (holding that the 
dismissal of one defendant under judicial immunity principles does not require the dismissal of the § 1983 action against other 
defendants). Here, the dismissal of the Neighbors on first amendment immunity grounds may not necessarily or automatically serve to negate 
the existence of the alleged conspiracy (since the Neighbors may have illegally conspired with the other defendants apart from 
their legitimate petitioning activity). Therefore, I will allow the § 1985(3) claim against the remaining defendants to go forward. I 
will, however, allow defendants to further argue this issue at later stages of the litigation. "
1172,3," Not all courts are in agreement that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine should be extended to other contexts. See e.g. LeBlanc-
Sternberg v. Fletcher, 781 F. Supp. 261 (S.D.N.Y. 1991) (Noerr-Pennington doctrine cannot be used to shield defendants from 
liability for discrimination)."
1172,4," As to the Neighbors, it does not matter that some of the alleged meetings were semi-private, rather than full township meetings, 
since the private meetings still involved the citizens' participating and airing grievances to local government. The other main allegation against the Neighbors is that they picketed outside Barnes, which is activity that is clearly protected by 
the first amendment, and thus is not even at issue here."
1172,5," The Court cites an example of ""sham"" petitioning: ""A classic example is the filing of frivolous objections to the license 
application of a competitor, with no expectation of achieving denial of the license but simply in order to impose expense and 
delay"". Id., citing California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642, 92 S. Ct. 609 (1972). "
1173,6, The federal action was filed in January 1996 and the defamation action was subsequently filed in state court in March 1996.
1173,7," In the defamation complaint, the plaintiff Commissioners specifically refer to the filing of the federal action as part of the ""smear 
campaign"" for which they seek redress in state court. See Defamation Complaint (Exhibit B to Amended Complaint) at PP 48-50, 
52. "
1174,8," Compare Hicks v. Miranda, 422 U.S. 332, 95 S. Ct. 2281, 45 L. Ed. 2d 223 (1975) (holding that a federal court can abstain 
when state criminal proceedings are filed after the federal action, but before federal court action has substantively proceeded on 
the merits). Note that Hicks involves a state criminal action stemming from an obscenity law (namely the seizure of ""obscene"" 
film from a theater and the prosecution of the theater employees and theater owner) and a federal challenge to the same 
obscenity law (brought by the theater owner after the arrest of the employees, but before his own arrest). The federal action in 
Hicks therefore was brought prior to the prosecution of the federal plaintiff (the theater owner) but after proceedings against 
other defendants had already commenced. The Supreme Court held that the federal plaintiff's interests were already being 
litigated in state court prior to the initiation of the federal suit, and that the proceedings against him in the state court provided 
him an opportunity to litigate his constitutional claim. See id., at 349. Therefore, the Hicks situation is distinguishable from the 
present action, where the state proceeding arose after (and in response to) the filing of the federal claim, and involves entirely 
separate issues which have no bearing on Barnes' constitutional interests. "
1175,9," Note that even if there was proper jurisdiction, neither the Zoning Hearing Board nor the state court reviewing the appeal would 
have the authority to award the relief sought by Barnes in the federal action. See id., at § 11006-A (court in land-use appeal 
cannot award damages or other forms of relief)."
1175,10," At most, the Zoning Hearing Board may try to determine whether the variance was improperly denied, or whether or not there 
was selective enforcement of the zoning ordinances. However, such a determination will not suffice to resolve the issues 
involved in the equal protection and substantive due process claims alleged here. Furthermore, there are issues in this federal action, such as the retaliation claim and the conspiracy claim, that are completely 
absent from any claim that the Zoning Hearing Board could possibly entertain. These issues are completely separate from the 
land-use issues and were never raised before. Such issues would not be ""preserved for review"" in the higher state courts."
1175,11," I note, however, that Barnes seeks various types of relief: compensatory damages, punitive damages, prospective injunction 
to prevent future uneven application of ordinances and prevent future § 1983 and § 1985(3) violations, and attorney's fees. See 
Amended Complaint at P 205. During oral argument, I asked Barnes to specifically address the nature of the injunctive relief 
sought, in order to better determine if such a request is appropriate. This discussion was the impetus for my request that Barnes 
file a letter brief on this issue. Barnes complied with my request by submitting a letter brief on May 15, 1996. The letter brief 
specifically identifies the six elements of injunctive relief sought by Barnes: (1) prohibiting defendants from applying existing 
rules in a discriminatory manner against Barnes; (2) prohibiting defendants from enforcing arbitrary policies against Barnes; (3) 
prohibiting defendants from intentionally interfering with Barnes' business relationships and prospective business relationships; 
(4) prohibiting defendants from denying Barnes the right to conduct its operations and enjoy its property free from interference; 
(5) prohibiting defendants from violating § 1983 and § 1985(3); (6) enjoining the campaign of bad faith harassment carried out 
through filing retaliatory law suits against Barnes. See Barnes' Letter Brief of May 15, 1996 at 2. Barnes' request for injunctive relief is broadly fashioned and threatens to pose grave harms to the independence and autonomy 
of local government. Since this issue is not specifically before me now, I will refrain from ruling on this matter at this time, but will 
note my concern that the requested injunctive relief poses a threat to the Township's ability to govern and enforce its laws, and 
may be an improper usurpation of power by the federal court. "
1176,12," The Township's motion to strike the punitive damages claim is granted. See Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247,

1210,1," Coca-Cola Southwest initially bid $ 5 million for both the Dr pepper and Canada Dry franchises, but subsequently increased its 
offer to $ 14.5 million. "
1211,2," At the time of the August 1984 transaction, there were a total of five competing soft-drink bottlers operating in San Antonio, 
including Coca-Cola Southwest and Dr Pepper-San Antonio."
1211,3," After 1984, Coca-Cola Southwest was involved in two additional transactions resulting in its receipt of new licenses from the Dr 
Pepper Company. First, in December 1986, Texas Bottling Group, Inc. purchased Coca-Cola Southwest; the FTC and the Dr 
Pepper Company were notified of the transaction, after which Dr Pepper Company issued new Dr Pepper licenses to Coca-Cola 
Southwest. Texas Bottling Group is still the sole shareholder of Coca-Cola Southwest. Second, in April 1987, Coca-Cola 
Southwest acquired the assets of the bottler of Dr Pepper and Coca-Cola soft drink products in Corpus Christi; again, as part of 
that transaction, the Dr Pepper Company issued new Dr Pepper licenses [to Coca-Cola Southwest] for the adjacent Corpus 
Christi territory."
1211,4," The FTC explains that it did not find out about the 1984 transaction until after it was completed, noting that Coca-Cola 
Southwest's purchase of the Dr Pepper assets was broken into two contracts (the $ 14.5 million acquisition and a $ 2.5 million 
sales agreement), each of which was below the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act's reporting threshold of $ 15 million."
1211,5," The ALJ determined that (1) the relevant product market included all carbonated soft drinks and other similar non-carbonated 
soft drinks; (2) the relevant geographic market was broader than the ten-county San Antonio area pled by Complaint Counsel; 
(3) entry was easy; (4) competition had been fierce; (5) no customer had complained about the situation; and (6) there was no 
likelihood of anticompetitive effects from Coca-Cola Southwest's receipt of the 1984 Dr Pepper licenses."
1211,6," Three Commissioners participated in the decision; one filed a concurring and dissenting opinion, and the author of the main 
opinion also filed a separate concurring opinion."
1211,7," The FTC found that Coca-Cola Southwest's receipt of the ""Dr Pepper"" and ""Canada Dry"" franchises increased its share of the

1217,11," The Commission was persuaded, stating: In reaching this conclusion, we reject [Coca-Cola Southwest's] efforts to characterize the horizontal acquisition of assets 
(e.g., franchise agreements) from a competing bottler as a vertical transaction merely because licenses from concentrate 
companies are involved. If this argument were accepted, it would immunize virtually all acquisitions by bottlers, including 
the acquisition of a major competitor, from antitrust scrutiny. "
1218,12," It bears emphasis that application of the Soft Drink Act does not result in immunity from federal antitrust laws; rather, the Act 
gives a different standard for evaluating soft drink licenses. As explained in the House Report: The [Soft Drink Act's] clarification eliminates uncertainty in the law that has plagued the industry, particularly smaller 
bottlers, during the last decade. It does not grant antitrust immunities. Indeed, the legislation will apply only in situations in 
which there is 'substantial and effective competition' among soft drink bottlers and among their syrup manufacturers in the 
relevant product and geographic markets. H. Rep. 2 (emphasis added). "

1224,1," As noted by the Supreme Court, the terminology used to discuss the preclusive effects of earlier litigation is somewhat

continuity the district court's use of the term ""res judicata"" as a synonym for ""claim preclusion,"" which refers to ""the effect of a 
judgment in foreclosing litigation of a matter that has never been litigated, because of a determination that it should have been 
advanced in an earlier suit."" Id. We are not confronted with any question of issue preclusion, also known as collateral estoppel,

1271,3," As the District Court explained: ""The present case does not involve any change in preexisting wage terms of either an active or

each NFL club. These players were not treated under the salary terms applicable to regular NFL players. Under the 1982 
Collective Bargaining Agreement, the NFL players were expressly given the right to negotiate the salary terms of their contracts. 
1982 Collective Bargaining Agreement at Article XXII, Plaintiffs' Exhibits at 1. By contrast, the developmental squad contracts 
indicates that the prospective developmental squad players had no right to negotiate their own salary terms but instead were to

2d 640, 85 S. Ct. 1596 (1965). Neither of these decisions holds that an employer conspiracy to restrain trade is exempted from 
antitrust regulation where an employee group has been implicated in the scheme. No Justice participating in Meat Cutters 
dissented from the proposition that hard core 'anticompetitive commercial restraint[s]' like 'price-fixing and market allocation' -- 
and petitioner would add group boy-cotts -- were subject to antitrust regulation even where bargained about.  381 U.S. at 732

court concluded, ""even viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff, nothing in Dr. Goldner's report tends to suggest that Dr.

1341,2," According to plaintiffs, 888 of GE's products had distinct list prices in early 1992. This figure includes, in some instances, 
separate list prices for different sizes or volumes of the same product. See Affidavit of John C. Beyer, dated Apr. 6, 1995, at P 
22."
1341,3," Because De Beers has not appeared in this proceeding and has not participated in discovery or in briefing this motion, we have 
little information about its products or pricing practices. From the limited information available, however, it seems safe to assume 
that De Beers produces an array of products comparable to GE's and that its pricing practices are similarly complex. For the purposes of this motion, our discussion of GE's products and pricing practices should be understood to apply to De 
Beers as well."
1341,4," In addition, plaintiffs also contend, based on information apparently obtained in discovery, that in March 1988, De Beers and 
GE almost simultaneously raised list prices on metal bonded saw diamond products, RVG diamond products and polycrystalline

1343,5," The proposed class definition includes persons who purchased industrial diamond products directly from GE or De Beers or 
from a corporation ""owned or controlled"" by GE or De Beers."
1343,6," Plaintiffs contend that the ""control"" exception to the Illinois Brick rule permits recovery by indirect purchasers who purchase

Cir. 1979); In Re Mid-Atlantic Toyota Antitrust Litigation, 516 F. Supp. 1287, 1292 (D. Md. 1981). GE argues that neither the Supreme Court nor the Second Circuit has recognized this ""extension"" of Illinois Brick's ""control"" 
exception and contends that we should decline to follow the cases cited by plaintiffs. "
1345,7," As support for this proposition, the Alcoholic Beverages court relied in part on In Re Master Key Antitrust Litigation, 528 F.2d 5, 
12 n.11 (2d Cir. 1975) (dismissing appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction), in which the Second Circuit stated in dictum that if the 
class plaintiffs in that case could establish that the defendants had engaged in a conspiracy that stabilized prices at 
supracompetitive levels and could show that each class member purchased the affected product, a jury could reasonably 
conclude that each class member suffered some injury as a result of the conspiracy. The Second Circuit has never squarely addressed the issue of impact in the class action context, however. "
1346,8," GE cites several horizontal price-fixing conspiracy cases in which courts declined to certify classes, despite the existence of 
base prices of some sort, because individual questions regarding proof of impact predominated over common questions. See 
Kenett Corp. v. Mass. Furniture & Piano Movers Ass'n, Inc., 101 F.R.D. 313, 314 (D. Mass. 1984) (standard fee schedules 
established by association of moving companies); American Custom Homes v. Detroit Lumberman's Ass'n, 91 F.R.D. 548, 549 
(E.D. Mich. 1981) (price listings published by retail lumber dealers' association); In Re Beef Indus. Antitrust Litigation, 1986-2 
Trade Cas. (CCH) P 67,277, at 61,414 (S.D. Tex. 1986) (prices published in industry ""yellow sheet""). None of these cases specifically discusses the base price argument advanced by plaintiffs. To the extent that the results of 
these cases may conflict with the reasoning of the cases cited in the text, we find the latter group of cases more persuasive. "
1347,9," Of course, the precise quantum of damages that each purchaser suffered would differ depending upon the purchase price that 
it was able to negotiate with defendants or their distributors. Individual questions would certainly arise in determining that figure, 
but those issues go to ascertaining damages rather than to demonstrating impact."
1347,10," As part of his analysis, plaintiffs' expert identified 955 pairs of transactions, involving 127 customers, in which the same 
customer bought the same amount of the same product before and after the 1992 list price increases. He found that the 
transaction prices paid by 108 of the 127 customers increased following the 1992 list price increases. See Beyer Aff., at PP 32-
34. GE contends that the fact that the transaction prices paid by 19 of the customers declined demonstrates that some purchasers 
were not impacted at all by the 1992 list price increases. GE therefore argues that the testimony of plaintiffs' own expert supports 
its contention that individualized inquiry is necessary to determine whether each class member suffered some injury as a result 
of the alleged conspiracy. We are not persuaded. Plaintiffs do not argue that purchasers of list-price products were impacted because the 1992 list prices resulted in transaction 
prices that were higher in absolute terms. Instead, they argue that the transaction prices paid by purchasers following the 1992 
list price increases were higher than they would have been if the list prices had been set in a competitive market. The results of 
the analysis conducted by plaintiffs' expert do not disprove this theory: it is quite possible that in the absence of the 1992 list 
price increases, those 19 customers would have paid even lower transaction prices. See id., at P 35. In fact, by demonstrating that the transaction prices paid by many customers rose, in absolute terms, following the 1992 list price 
increases, the testimony of plaintiffs' expert provides some support for plaintiffs' theory that the transaction prices paid by those 
19 customers were also higher than they would have been if defendants had not, as plaintiffs allege, set their list prices at 
artificially high levels. "
1348,11," A four-year statute of limitations applies to plaintiffs' claims for treble damages. See 15 U.S.C. § 15b. Therefore, plaintiffs must 
demonstrate that defendants fraudulently concealed the alleged price-fixing conspiracy, or certain portions of their claims are 
time-barred. "
1359,1," Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2, provides that ""every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or 
combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several 
States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony . . . ."""
1359,2," Previously, at the close of plaintiff's case, the district court directed a verdict in favor of Blue Cross on plaintiffs' § 1 claims, 
which were wholly unrelated to the MFN clause."
1359,3," Technically, a buyer's substantial power over price and market entry is referred to as ""monopsony power"" as distinguished from 
a seller's monopoly power. See In re Beef Indus. Antitrust Litig., 907 F.2d 510, 514-16 (5th Cir. 1990). However, the relevant 
inquiry remains virtually identical and thus, explains the First Circuit's use of the term ""monopoly power"" throughout Ocean State. "
1362,4," In Kartell, Blue Shield's ban on balance billing clearly saved its subscribers from incurring additional provider costs. The 
situation in Ocean State, however, is a bit less clear. Curiously, in footnote 11, the Ocean State court responded to plaintiff's 
contention that Blue Cross never actually passed along savings from use of its MFN clause to subscribers stating, "" . . . nothing 
turns on whether Blue Cross in fact lowered its rates. The fact remains that achieving lower costs is a legitimate business 
justification under the antitrust laws."" 883 F.2d at 1111 n.11. Not only is such a contention unduly severe, but more importantly 
contradicts both the Sherman Act's focus on lower consumer prices and the Ocean State court's own reliance on such a 
concern. In fact, in the paragraph following this footnote, the court favorably quotes Kartell's admonition that ""'courts . . . should 
be . . . reluctant to condemn too speedily . . . an agreement that, on its face, appears to bring lower price benefits to the 
consumer,'"" Id. at 1111 (quoting Kartell at 930-31), and notes that such a consideration was also ""relevant to the present case as 
well."" Id. at 1111 (emphasis added). "
1363,5," For example, Delta contends that the total number of dentists who disaffiliated from Dental Blue due to the threat of Delta's 
MFN clause was five or six. Certainly, such a contention, if true, helps undermine the government's allegation that Delta's MFN 
clause has produced substantial anticompetitive effects, but, at this juncture, the focus rests solely on the government's 
Complaint. "

Reply Memorandum, filed January 30, 1995, at p. 1, n. 1. ABEM asserted statute of limitations as its third affirmative defense in 
its Answer to the Second Amended Complaint, ABEM's Answer, filed February 28, 1994 at P 137, however, ABEM never 
pursued this affirmative defense on a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint."
1387,4," Several of the Defendants made motions for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; 
as motions for summary judgment are premature at this time, George C. Frey Ready-Mixed Concrete, Inc. v. Pine Hill Concrete 
Mix Corp., 554 F.2d 551, 555 (2d Cir. 1977) (motion for summary judgment should not be entertained before discovery has been 
completed in antitrust cases in which relevant facts are disputed), these motions will be considered as motions to dismiss for 
failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Discovery was limited to jurisdictional issues only by the Decision and 
Order filed April 29, 1994. "
1388,5," The court may not consider the Report and Recommendation filed on January 16, 1996 as the Report and Recommendation 
relied on materials outside the pleadings. Additionally, the court may not take judicial notice of the Report and Recommendation, 
as requested by Defendants, as judicial notice may only be taken of facts not subject to reasonable dispute which are generally 
known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or are capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources 
whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned. Fed.R.Evid. 201(b)."
1388,6," ""Under Zenith, where defendants are alleged to have committed acts injurious to a plaintiff pursuant to an unlawful conspiracy, 
and where defendants committed some such acts more than four years before plaintiff commenced suit, and other acts less than 
four years before plaintiff commenced suit, the plaintiff is allowed to recover damages resulting only from those acts committed 
less than four years before commencement of the suit."" Imperial Point Colonnades Condominium v. Mangurian, 549 F.2d 1029, 
1034 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 859 (1977). "
1390,7," Although it may be argued that none of the acts alleged would have occurred but for the initial alleged violation by ABEM, the 
closure of the practice-track, and the subsequent acts by the Defendants are factually and legally related to the closure of the 
practice-track, these acts are not the result of ABEM's closure of the practice-track."
1390,8," HN5[
] Injurious conduct in furtherance of a conspiracy committed within the limitations period ensures a timely cause of 
action against all members of the conspiracy. United States v. Fletcher, 928 F.2d 495, 498 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 815, 
116 L. Ed. 2d 41, 112 S. Ct. 67 (1991) (limitations period begins to run after the last overt act in furtherance of the main goals of 
the conspiracy); Bankers Trust v. Feldesman, 676 F. Supp. 496, 504 (S.D.N.Y. 1987), reversed on other grounds sub nom.

[continuing civil] conspiracy, a cause of action accrues against all of the persons who are then members of the conspiracy for the 
damages caused by that act""); Driscoll v. City of New York, 650 F. Supp. 1522 (S.D.N.Y. 1987) (four year statute of limitations 
applicable to antitrust actions was held to run from each injury plaintiff sustained as a result of the acts of the conspirators). While the Second Amended Complaint is not precise as to the exact dates upon which each hospital Defendant and CORD 
joined the conspiracy, it alleges that each Defendant entered the conspiracy during the limitations period and has continuously 
engaged in conspiratorial acts during the statute of limitations period. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that acts in 
furtherance of the conspiracy continued into the statute of limitations period, and therefore, the Second Amended Complaint 
cannot be dismissed. "
1391,9," It is sufficiently alleged that ABEM, CORD and the hospital Defendants are engaged in and affect interstate commerce through 
their activities. Second Amended Complaint at PP 36, 87. Plaintiffs state that the hospital Defendants regularly treat patients 
from all over the United States, purchase machines, goods, and other equipment and supplies from suppliers located throughout 
the United States, and receive revenues from patients and insurers throughout the United States. Second Amended Complaint 
at P 36. "
1392,10," Although Defendants assert that Plaintiffs do not sufficiently plead that the hospitals conspired through the physicians acting 
as representatives or agents of the hospital Defendants, requiring Plaintiffs to plead this information more specifically would 
impose a heightened pleading standard notwithstanding the fact that only a ""short, plain and concise"" statement giving notice to 
the Defendants is all that is necessary in an antitrust case. Michaels Building, 848 F.2d at 681; George C. Frey Ready-Mixed 
Concrete, 554 F.2d at 554; Newberger, 365 F. Supp. at 1367-68. "
1393,11," Plaintiffs also assert that the Defendants have misled the public as to the qualifications of emergency medicine physicians. 
Second Amended Complaint at PP 79-82."
1393,12," As an agreement to restrain trade need not inhibit all competition in the relevant market to fall under scrutiny within Section 1 
of the Sherman Act, see Associated Press v. United States, 326 U.S. 1, 17, 89 L. Ed. 2013, 65 S. Ct. 1416 (1945), thus, 
although Plaintiffs may be able to compete for positions in emergency medicine in some hospitals, they may nevertheless 
interpose a Section 1 claim. Id. "
1394,13," Denial of access to professional association memberships which confer economic advantage for members represents a 
prohibited restraint of trade for Sherman Act purposes unless found to be reasonable. See Kreuzer v. American Academy of 
Periodontology, 237 U.S. App. D.C. 43, 735 F.2d 1479, 1490 (D.C.Cir. 1984). Therefore, after discovery and trial, a jury 
conceivably may conclude that ABEM's prerequisites for Diplomate status and the Defendants' initial closure and subsequent 
refusal to reopen the practice-track mode of eligibility through the alleged conspiracy are anti-competitive and in violation of the 
Sherman Act."
1394,14," In order for a physician to become ABEM eligible, that physician must complete an accredited emergency medicine residency 
training program. Second Amended Complaint at PP 4, 6-7, 49-51, 58-62. "
1413,1," It is not mere coincidence that the two cases raise essentially the same claims. Counsel for Soth has admitted in other litigation 
that he regularly files two actions in state court which are identical save that one has the federal claims omitted in an attempt to 
defeat defendants' removal rights. See DiCarlo v. Baltimore County, Maryland, No. MJG-95-556 (Nov. 13, 1995) (imposing costs 
under 28 U.S.C. § 1927 against counsel). "
1414,2," HN3[
] To maintain a claim for abusive discharge in Maryland, Soth must show that he was discharged in violation of a ""clear 
mandate of public policy . . . ."" Adler v. American Standard Corp., 291 Md. 31, 47, 432 A.2d 464 (1981). The public policy 
allegedly violated is provided by Maryland Antitrust law. Relying on McCormick, supra, The Sun argues that the wrongfulness 
of the discharge is determined by the CBA because Article 8 of the CBA governs disputes between the Sun and its employees 
and an arbitrator found just cause to fire Soth. This argument is foreclosed by Lingle, supra, which also reviewed a CBA with 
these provisions but held that a claim alleging discharge in retaliation for exercising a statutory right is not preempted because 
the employer's motivation for firing the employee is a ""purely factual question."" Lingle, supra, at 407. "
1423,1," Honorable John C. Godbold, United States Circuit Judge for the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation. "
1424,2," The federal ""Class I"" price is set monthly by a regional ""Market Administrator"" in the Department of Agriculture. Under federal 
regulations, Northern New Jersey is grouped in a region with New York known as ""Order No. 2"", 7 C.F.R. § 1002.2 (1995); 
Southern New Jersey is grouped with Eastern Pennsylvania in ""Order No. 4,"" 7 C.F.R. § 1004.2 (1995). "
1427,3," In addition, we believe that the district court may have improperly imposed its preferred reading of paragraph 14 without a 
thorough consideration of alternative readings or of the parties' intent. In relevant part, paragraph 14 of the 1985 Supply Contract 
provides: This instrument is intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement and as a complete and exclusive 
statement of its terms. No course of dealings between the parties . . . shall be relevant or admissible to supplement, 
explain, or vary any of the terms of this agreement . . .. Acceptance of, or acquiescence in, a course of performance . . . 
shall not be relevant or admissible to determine the meaning of this agreement even though the accepting or acquiescing 
party has knowledge of the nature of the performance and an opportunity to make objection.. . . This agreement can only 
be modified by a writing signed by both parties or their duly authorized agents. Joint App. 321-322 (1985 Contract, para. 14) (emphasis added). It is possible that a reasonable jury could have interpreted the contract, which prohibited unilateral modification or variance in the 
absence of a writing, to also prohibit unilateral termination of the contract without a writing. On the other hand, because 
paragraph 14 does not expressly prohibit unilateral termination and because the contract does not provide for a specific term, 
the parties may have intended to allow for unilateral termination by conduct. The district court's resolution of this ambiguity 
without citation or support also causes us some concern."
1427,4," Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, we do not believe that it is necessary for us to decide in this case whether an at-will 
contract can be terminated only by express notification. See Dissenting Opinion at 3. That is not the issue before this court. 
Rather, we decide only that there remains an issue of fact regarding (1) what conduct by defendants, verbal or otherwise, 
resulted in termination of the 1985 contract and (2) when that conduct occurred for statute of limitation purposes. Because these 
factual ambiguities remain, summary judgment was improperly granted. "
1430,5," HN13[
] Plaintiff must prove that: (1) the defendants contracted, combined or conspired among each other; (2) the combination or conspiracy produced anti-
competitive effects within the relevant product and geographic markets; (3) the objects of the conduct pursuant to that 
contract or conspiracy were illegal; and (4) the plaintiffs were injured as a proximate result of that conspiracy. J.F. Feeser, 909 F.2d at 1541 (quoting Tunis Bros., 763 F.2d 1482 at 1489). "
1433,6," In relevant part, § 12A:2-309 provides:"
1433,12," A:2-309. Absence of Specific Time Provisions; Notice of Termination . . . (2) Where the contract provides for successive performances but is indefinite in duration it is valid for a reasonable time but 
unless otherwise agreed may be terminated at any time by either party. (3) Termination of a contract by one party except on the happening of an agreed event requires that reasonable notification 
be received by the other party and an agreement dispensing with notification is invalid if its operation would be 
unconscionable. "
1437,1," Plaintiffs also assert that the district court erred by failing to review the summary judgment record de novo before adopting the 
magistrate judge's recommendation, using an improper standard in deciding whether summary judgment was appropriate and 
failing to certify plaintiffs as a damages class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3). Our de novo review of the record 
and use of the proper standard for granting summary judgment cure the first two of these asserted errors. Our affirmance of the 
district court's decision to grant summary judgment makes it unnecessary for us to consider the third."

] Tying exists when ""a seller refuses to sell one product, which a buyer desires, unless the buyer also agrees to 
purchase a second product, which is not otherwise desired from this seller on the offered terms…. The desired product is called "
1438,," the ""tying' product; the other is the ""tied' product."" 9 Phillip E. Areeda, Antitrust Law P 1700a (1991). See also HN3[
] Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, 504 U.S. 451, 461-62, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 2079-80, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992). A tying arrangement is per se illegal when it has the following characteristics: (1) Two separate products (as opposed to 
components of a single product; (2) The two products are tied together or customers are coerced; (3) The supplier 
possesses substantial economic power over the tying product; (4) The tie has an anticompetitive effect on the tied market; 
and (5) The tie affects a not insubstantial volume of commerce. 9 Areeda, Antitrust Law P 1702. See also Kodak, 504 U.S. 
at 461-62, 112 S. Ct. at 2079-80; Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 11-28, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 1558-66, 
80 L. Ed. 2d 2 (1984). Tying arrangements and other restraints of trade that do not fit the criteria for per se illegality are evaluated under the Rule 
of Reason. Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist., 466 U.S. at 29, 104 S. Ct. at 1567. Under the Rule of Reason, the plaintiff has 
the burden of proving that the tying arrangement ""unreasonably restrained competition."" Id. This burden requires an inquiry 
into the actual effect of the tying arrangement on competition in the tied market. Id."
1438,3," HN4[
] The relevant market in an antitrust inquiry is defined by the cross-elasticity of demand between a given product and its 
substitutes. 2 Phillip E. Areeda & Donald F. Turner, Antitrust Law P 519a (1991). The cross-elasticity of demand for substitutes 
measures consumers' propensity to switch from one product to another, similar product when relative prices change. See 
William J. Baumol & Alan S. Blinder, Economics: Principles and Policy at 343 (1979). Products similar enough that a small 
relative price change causes consumers to substitute one for another are in the same market. 2 Areeda & Turner, Antitrust Law 
P 525a."
1438,4," Information costs in this case are the costs incurred by new agents in finding out how much Farmers will charge for electronic 
access to policy information and other services after they begin selling Farmers policies. Switching costs are the costs incurred 
in switching from selling Farmers insurance to selling the policies of another company. Compare Kodak, 504 U.S. at 473-77, 112 
S. Ct. at 2083-88. "
1439,5," Price discrimination is charging different buyers different prices for the same item. A price-discriminating monopolist charges 
each consumer as much as the consumer is willing to pay for an item. Consumers who desperately need a particular product are 
charged a high price for it while those who do not really need the product and will refuse to buy it rather than pay a high price are 
charged a relatively low price. A price-discriminating monopolist makes as much money as possible on its product because it 
charges high prices to the people who are willing to pay high prices without losing sales to people willing to pay only a low price. 
See 2 Areeda & Turner Antitrust, P 514a. "
1440,6," Substitutes limit market power by giving consumers an alternative to paying an above-market price for a product. The existence 
of a good substitute at a competitive price (in this case manual access to policy information for free) prevents a producer from 
selling its product at an above-market price. An attempt to raise price of the product above a competitive level will be met with a 
shift in demand from the product to its substitute. See 2 Areeda & Turner, Antitrust at P 525a."
1440,7," It is important to note that even agents who faced high switching costs in the decision to switch insurance companies could 
easily have continued selling policies with the manual system. Farmers clearly did not require agents to use FANS and "
1441,," continued to supply its agents with manual policy information for free. Even, if manual access to policy information was inferior to 
electronic access, it was a reasonably good substitute that would have seriously limited Farmers' ability to charge above-market 
prices for electronic access and computers even to those agents with many policies in force. "
1451,1," On this motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), all factual allegations in the complaint are assumed to be true. Ferran v. 
Town of Nassau, 11 F.3d 21, 22 (2d Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 130 L. Ed. 2d 489, 115 S. Ct. 572 (1994)."
1451,2," For the purposes of this Opinion, I will hereafter refer to the plaintiffs collectively as Sage. "
1453,3," Originally, this action was filed in tandem with a similar action brought by the Union. Both actions were filed while the strike was 
ongoing. Immediately after defendants moved to dismiss both complaints, the strike was settled. As a result, the Union 
voluntarily withdrew its action. Sage, however, did not withdraw the present action, maintaining that it was still entitled to 
injunctive and monetary relief. "
1454,4," Consequently, for the purposes of this motion I need not decide whether defendants' alleged conduct indeed constitutes a per 
se violation, as plaintiffs allege. "
1455,5," Because of Harvard's limited financial resources, Sage had to advance funding of Harvard's payroll. There is no further 
description of this financial arrangement in the complaint. This allegation alone does not constitute antitrust injury. "
1456,6," Of course, neither RAB nor ISS concedes that RAB forced cleaning service contractors to enter this agreement. Yet I must 
accept the allegations in Sage's complaint as true. "
1457,7," Of course, this argument also assumes that defendants' actions had some anti-competitive effect on the market, which, as 
discussed above, they did not. "
1463,1," However, plaintiffs' opposition motion states the harm to plaintiffs was intentional and was the means by which defendants 
carried out the conspiracy. The court doubts that the closing of one sugar refinery was ""the means"" by which the defendants 
could have allegedly controlled the sugar market. "
1464,2," For instance, based on the plaintiffs' claim the transporters of the sugar cane from the fields to the refinery would also have 
claims, because they have suffered economic damage to their businesses."
1464,3," In addition, to apportion damages among consumers would be complex and impossible. "
1465,4," Plaintiffs' documents do not specifically state farmers and consumers have been overcharged as a result of defendants' 
actions, the court assumes this. "
1469,*," This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 
Ninth Cir. R. 36-3. "
1479,1," For convenience, these defendants will be collectively referred to as the BEI five."
1479,2," Plaintiff's expert, Dr. McClave, estimates that approximately ninety percent of the patients treated by Jacksonville based retina 
specialists are referred by other health care providers."
1479,3," At the time this lawsuit was commenced, there were three retinal specialty practices in Jacksonville: RA, Florida Retina Institute 
and that of Dr. James Bolling who is affiliated with the Mayo Clinic. "
1480,4," Whether there is an actual combination or conspiracy appears to be an issue among the parties. Defendants seem to argue 
that BEI is a legitimate joint venture and that the referral of patients exclusively to FRI is reasonably necessary to effectuate its 
purpose. However, assuming defendants can establish the existence of a joint venture, its practices would not thereby 
automatically be immune from antitrust scrutiny. See 2 EARL W. KINTNER, FEDERAL ANTITRUST LAW § 9.15 (1980). "
1481,5," In early 1994, the Florida EyeCare Network was formed. Plaintiffs' principals were among the initial shareholders of the network 
and are the only retina specialists in the network, although, according to Plaintiff, there is no agreement to refer retina patients "
1482,," solely to RA. Plaintiff also refers to the Florida EyeCare network as an unsuccessful venture, but does not appear to attribute 
that lack of success to any allegedly illegal conduct of defendants. A third network, Eye Care Associates of North Florida, has 
also been formed. Dr. Bolling, of the Mayo Clinic, is the exclusive retina care provider for that network. "
1483,6, There is no allegation that Levenson breached any contractual relationship he had with RA when he cancelled the contract.

Austria, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Japan. (Am. Compl. P 33). "

] Section 1973l(e) provides: ""In any action or proceeding to enforce the voting guarantees of the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment, the court, in its 
discretion, may allow a prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fees as part of the costs."""
1504,42, U.S.C. § 1973l(e).
1504,5," Indeed, the similarity among the language and underlying purposes of the fee award provisions of the Voting Rights Act and 
the Attorneys' Fees Act has led the Eleventh Circuit to conclude that the standards for awarding fees under the two provisions 
should generally be the same. Maloney v. City of Marietta, 822 F.2d 1023, 1025 n.2 (11th Cir. 1987). See also City of Burlington 
v. Dague, 505 U.S. 557, 112 S. Ct. 2638, 120 L. Ed. 2d 449 (1992)(case law articulating what is a reasonable attorney's fee 
applies uniformly to all federal fee-shifting statutes). The Court will, therefore, use cases construing § 1988, in addition to cases 
interpreting § 1973l(e)."
1504,6, The Eleventh Circuit has defined these special circumstances as: 
1505,," (1) where the plaintiff's action asserted essentially a private tort claim for money damages, (2) where the plaintiff was not 
instrumental in achieving the remedy sought, (3) where plaintiffs challenged an antiquated, rarely enforced statute, and (4) 
where the plaintiff through a settlement or consent order agreed to compromise his right to pursue subsequent fees. Love, 5 F.3d at 1410 (citations omitted). Defendant has not asserted the existence of any of these special circumstances, and 
the Court finds none to be present."
1505,7," Decisions of the former Fifth Circuit rendered prior to October 1, 1981, are binding precedent in the Eleventh Circuit. See 
Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981)(en banc). "
1508,8," Under Missouri v. Jenkins, where the prevailing practice in the legal community is to bill paralegal work separately at market 
rates, as opposed to including such services in the attorney's hourly rate, statutory attorney fees may be awarded separately.

1508,9," At this point it is usually necessary to determine whether the lodestar should be enhanced or diminished.  Desisto College v. 
Town of Howey-in the Hills, 718 F. Supp. 906, 923 (M.D.Fla. 1989). Neither party has asked for such an adjustment, and the 
Court has found that no adjustment is necessary. See Delaware Valley Citizens' Council, 478 U.S. at 565-66 (There is a strong 
presumption that the lodestar amount represents the reasonable fee award and, thus, the lodestar should only be adjusted in 
rare and exceptional circumstances.). "
1509,10," The reasonableness standard under § 1988 is more liberal than the standard employed under Rule 54(d) of the Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure and under the commonly used statute 28 U.S.C. § 1920. Indeed, under 28 U.S.C. § 1920, a party may only 
recover for expenses explicitly provided by statute. Crawford Fitting Co. v. J.T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U.S. 437, 445, 107 S. Ct.

1513,1," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), this court adopted as binding precedent all 
decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981. "
1514,2," There is no dispute that Kotam's single claim for price discrimination falls squarely within the terms of the parties' agreement to 
arbitrate ""claims asserting violation of the antitrust laws."""
1514,3," This order vacated the panel's opinion. See 11th Cir. R. 35-11 (""Unless otherwise expressly provided, the effect of granting a 
rehearing en banc is to vacate the panel opinion and to stay the mandate.""). "
1515,4," The American Safety court also relied on two other considerations not cited by the Cobb court: (1) that arbitration clauses might 
be contracts of adhesion; and (2) that the claim in American Safety was ""that the agreement itself was an instrument of 
illegality."" 391 F.2d at 827. (emphasis added). In Mitsubishi, the Supreme Court rejected the first consideration, noting that ""the 
mere appearance of an antitrust dispute does not alone warrant invalidation of the selected forum on the undemonstrated 
assumption that the arbitration clause is tainted."" Mitsubishi, 473 U.S. at 632, 105 S. Ct. at 3357. While the second rationale has 
not been called into question, it was not relied upon by the Cobb court and does not apply under the facts of this case. "
1516,5," In McMahon, the Supreme Court also revisited an earlier case, Wilko v. Swan, 346 U.S. 427, 74 S. Ct. 182, 98 L. Ed. 168 
(1953), and that Court's concerns about arbitration. The McMahon Court noted that Wilko stood for the proposition that 
arbitration would ""weaken [a plaintiffs'] ability to recover"" under the securities laws, and that the arbitration agreement in that 
case was unenforceable ""only because arbitration was judged inadequate to enforce the statutory rights created by § 12(2) [of 
the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 771(2)]."" McMahon, 482 U.S. at 228-31, 107 S. Ct. at 2338-40. Questioning that reasoning, the 
Court stated ""it is difficult to reconcile Wilko's mistrust of the arbitral process with this Court's subsequent decisions involving the 
Arbitration Act."" McMahon, 482 U.S. at 231-32, 107 S. Ct. at 2340 (citing Mitsubishi). Ultimately, the Court overruled Wilko in 
Rodriguez-De Quijas v. Shearson/American Express Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 109 S. Ct. 1917, 104 L. Ed. 2d 526 (1989), relying 
largely on McMahon and Mitsubishi. "
