19  See generally, California Wine Industry, supra, at pages 26 (?the French viticultural journal, Revue Viticole, in 1862, credited 
California with being the only wine-producing area of North America capable of competing with the product from Europe?? and 
133 (noting that 35 medals were awarded to California wines at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1889).
20  In addition?and belying Bronco's claims that this and similar statutes lacked detail?the statute contained various other 
provisions dealing comprehensively with the production and labeling of wine. (See Stats. 1887, ch. 36,  3??, pp. 47??9.)
21  The Ex parte Kohler decision proceeded to construe the act's labeling requirements as prohibiting the sale of wines not 
meeting the definition of pure wines under the act, but as not subjecting to penalty a merchant who sells wine that is pure but 
lacks the required labels. ( Ex parte Kohler, supra, 74 Cal. at pp. 44??5.) 
22  (1887 Colo. Sess. Laws,  2, p. 18 et seq.) The legislation required that wine be ?pure?defined as made from ?the juice of 
the grape?and specified that ?[n]o vinous ??liquors shall be offered or exposed for sale in this State, unless the ??package, 
containing such liquors, shall be plainly??marked with ?the word ?pure??wine,??and displaying ?the name or brand of the particular 
kind of wine so offered or exposed.??(Id.,  3 & 4, pp. 18??9.)
