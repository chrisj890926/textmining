24,2," Section 3 of the Sherman Act applies to antitrust violations involving the District of Columbia and United States territories.  The 
complaint contains no reference to these localities.  The claim under section 3 therefore is dismissed.  Section 12 of the Clayton 
Act, 15 U.S.C.  § 22, is a venue provision. "
25,3," In Blue Shield, supra, 102 S. Ct. at 2547 n. 12, the Supreme Court declined to comment on the ""relative utility"" of the ""target 
area"" test of antitrust standing which has been articulated by the Second Circuit.  Even if the target area test is still valid, 
however, Level I has alleged facts sufficient to allow it to maintain an action because Level I claims that it was the ""person 
against whom the conspiracy was aimed."" Calderone Enterprises Corp. v. United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc.  [1971 TRADE 
CASES P73,788], 454 F. 2d 1292, 1295 (2d Cir. 1971). "
26,4," Both the Third Circuit and the Ninth Circuit have indicated, in the context of discussing union agreements with non-labor 
groups, that ""vertical combinations designed to exclude from the market direct competitors of members of the combinations"" 
may constitute per se violations of section one.  Consolidated Express, Inc. v. New York Shipping Association, 602 F. 2d 494, 
522 (3rd Cir. 1979), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 448 U.S. 902 (1980); Ackerman Chillingworth, Inc. v. Pacific 
Electrical Contractors Association, supra, 579 F. 2d at 490 n. 7. The Second Circuit, however, in Oreck Corp. v. Whirlpool Corp., 
supra, 579 F. 2d at 131 rejected this position."
26,5," Certain provisions enacted by Congress which remove unions from the full reach of the antitrust laws, see United States v. 
Hutcheson, 312 U.S. 219 (1941) have been described as the ""statutory exemption."" See United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 
381 U.S. 657 (1965). The non-statutory exemption is a judicially created doctrine that also serves to protect certain agreements 
between unions and non-labor groups from antitrust liability.  Id.  Retailer defendants do not contend that either type of 
exemption is applicable to them here. "
28,6," The allegations described above also demonstrate that the complaint in this action contained more than a ""bare bones 
statement of conspiracy,"" Heart Disease Research Foundation v. General Motors Corp.  [1972 TRADE CASES P74,076], 463 F. 
2d 98, 100 (2d Cir. 1972) and therefore meet the pleading requirements of Rule 8(a), Fed. R. Civ. P."
28,7," Congress may accord standing to a party who, in the absence of legislation, would lack the ability to maintain an action.  See 
Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 409 U.S. 205 (1972). Section 301 of the LMRDA, for example, authorizes a labor "
29,," organization that is a party to a collective bargaining agreement to sue to enforce that agreement on behalf of its members.  See 
Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U.S. 448 (1957). Defendant Joint Board, however, was not a party to the collective 
bargaining agreement it seeks to enforce on behalf of former Level I employees and therefore can not derive standing from the 
LMRDA. "
42,1," The Philips designee until mid-1975 was MLC, Inc., which operated as a subsidiary corporation.  PBSI took over as designated 
distributor in 1975 after complaints about MLC's effectiveness in handling mlc distribution.  MLC is not involved in this litigation. "
47,2," Fontana Aviation, Inc. v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 460 F. Supp. 1151 (N.D. Ill. 1978), rev'd on other grounds, 617 F.2d 478 (7th Cir. 
1980), although cited heavily by GBS, is not good law in this circuit to the extent that it disregards the role of supply 
substitutability in the product market definition, see id. at 1156. Whether real or only potential, reasonable interchangeability of 
supply is significant because the existence of possible competitors constrains prices even where there is no direct competition.  
See ILC Peripherals, 458 F. Supp. at 427-29. Fontana's identification of a market for Cessna avionics seems internally 
inconsistent as well.  The court noted that customers bought airplanes without paying any attention to avionics.  Had the court 
adhered to its own admonition that real-world consumer conduct should dictate the product market definition, 460 F. Supp. at 
1157 n.20, it would have been forced to conclude that the relevant market was for aircraft.  Fontana's strategy in approaching 
the avionic market by buying unequipped planes and then selling packaged planes with avionics in competition with Cessna 
acknowledged the inseparability of the two markets. GBS also criticizes the district court's reliance on Bushie v. Stenocord Corp., 460 F.2d 116 (9th Cir. 1972), and Spectrofuge 
Corp. v. Beckman Instruments, Inc., 575 F.2d 256 (5th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 939, 59 L. Ed. 2d 499, 99 S. Ct. 1289 
(1979). We find its criticism marred by its failure to distinguish existing and potential competition, and its unwillingness to follow 
the court in ILC Peripherals and impute proper significance to the latter. "
53,3," Although the counterclaim also appears to state a claim of monopolization, Philips concedes in its reply brief that it raised only 
an attempt claim.  Were Philips to raise a straight monopolization claim, it could be disposed of quickly.  Our rejection of GBS's 
market definition would be equally fatal to any counterclaim predicated on Philips mlcs as a relevant market. GBS had no 
significant power in other markets.  It played no significant role in the general mlc market.  Charges of monopoly in the small 
business computer market would be equally insupportable, given GBS's de minimis portion of the growing and increasingly 
competitive market already shared, as Philips admits, by nearly seventy firms.  There is no evidence of its power in this market, 
as required by United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778, 86 S. Ct. 1698 (1966)."
53,4," The court also noted that the withdrawal of the Philips computer from the domestic market motivated GBS's defection.  Philips 
correctly urges that the district court erred if it believed Philips withdrew before GBS agreed to market the Diablo.  GBS 
incorporated Shasta in 1976, two years before Philips pulled out of its American computer operations.  The district court may 
have been referring to Philips' effective withdrawal from the market by its failure to provide an operational CRT computer in time 
to compete with the Diablo, not to its final departure in 1978. In any event, Philips' failure to provide substantial evidence that its 
computers were ""directly competitive"" with the Diablo makes the district court's additional reliance on the timing of Philips' retreat 
harmless error at worst.  Thus, although we agree that the court's second finding may well be either misleading or incorrect, we 
need only address the first finding, as it is dispositive. "
61,1," Western Electric, and AT&T subsidiary, manufactures telephone terminal equipment sold by AT&T."
61,2," The AT&T brief describes the potential harms to the telephone network from ""unbridled terminal equipment"" as follows: Improper voltages generated or transmitted by customer-provided terminal equipment can cause potentially hazardous 
electric shock to telephone company customers and employees.  Longitudinal imbalance usually results from improper 
grounding of the telephone lines and can cause a user to hear increased noise or another voice (i.e., crosstalk) on the 
telephone line.  Excessive signal power also causes noise and crosstalk.  Faulty network control signaling can cause "
62,," numerous problems, including wrong numbers, false busy signals, and incorrect billing . . . . Although a minor problem 
might be acceptable to a particular customer, the combined effect of many such problems could impair telephone service 
for other customers. Brief at 11 n.9. It is to be noted, however, that no proof of actual harm to the telephone network from interconnection with competitors' terminal 
equipment was ever adduced before the FCC, see Proposals for New or Revised Classes of Interstate and Foreign Message 
Toll Telephone Service (MTS) and Wide Area Telephone Service (WATS), 56 F.C.C. 2d 593, 596, 598 (1975) (First Report & 
Order), or in this case.  The FCC certification standards as set forth in the order cited above, and as subsequently amended, are 
nevertheless designed to prevent the occurrence of the four basic potential harms -- hazardous voltages, excessive signal power 
levels, excessive longitudinal imbalance, and improper network control signalling.  Id. at 601-11."
62,3," This depends on how ""harm"" is defined; AT&T has always advanced the idea that anything causing a user to hear increased 
noise or another voice (crosstalk) is harmful and that longitudinal imbalance and excessive signal power do just that.  See note 2 
supra."
62,4," The court stated: To say that a telephone subscriber may produce the result in question by cupping his hand and speaking into it, but may 
not do so by using a device which leaves his hand free to write or do whatever else he wishes, is neither just nor 
reasonable."
62,238, F.2d at 269.
62,5, Tariff FCC No. 132 provided in part: B. GENERAL REGULATIONS
62,7," . Unauthorized Attachments or Connections. -- No equipment, apparatus, circuit or device not furnished by the telephone 
company shall be attached to or connected with the facilities furnished by the telephone company, whether physically, by 
induction or otherwise [except as provided in this tariff.] In case any such unauthorized attachment or connection is made, "
63,," the telephone company shall have the right to remove or disconnect the same; or to suspend the service during the 
continuance of said attachment or connection; or to terminate the service."
63,24," . Miscellaneous Devices Provided by the Customer. -- The provisions of paragraph 7 preceding shall not be construed or 
applied to bar a customer from using devices which serve his convenience in his use of the facilities of the telephone 
company in the service for which they are furnished under this tariff, provided any such device so used would not endanger 
the safety of telephone company employees or the public; damage, require change in or alteration of, or involve direct 
electrical connection to, the equipment or other facilities of the telephone company; or interfere with the proper functioning 
of such equipment or facilities, or impair the operation of the telephone system or otherwise injure the public in its use of the 
telephone company's services.  [Except as otherwise provided in this tariff,] nothing herein shall be construed to permit the 
use of [a recording device] or of a device to interconnect any line or channel of the telephone company with any other 
communications line or channel of the company or of any other person. Quoted in Use of the Carterphone Device, 13 F.C.C.2d at 437 (brackets in original; footnotes omitted)."
63,6," The Carterfone transmitted to a two-way radio at the base station serving the mobile radio system.  To connect a telephone 
user to the mobile radio user, the base station's telephone handset was placed on a cradle in the Carterfone which automatically 
switched the radio to the transmitting mode when the mobile user spoke, and returned it to the receiving mode when he stopped 
-- all this without any direct electrical connection to the telephone network. "
65,7," The PCA mechanism generally combined in a single housing a ""network control signalling unit,"" which AT&T had always 
claimed was necessary to protect against wrong numbers, false busy signals and incorrect billing, and a ""connecting 
arrangement""; hence the term ""protective connecting arrangement."""
65,8," The only data AT&T produced, however, addressed effects on the network, such as crosstalk, rather than causes.  Thus, in 
response to a request by the FCC Common Carrier Bureau for comments on certification standards proposals in October of 
1973, AT&T in part submitted the following: It is often argued that the impact on the quality of service of the interconnection of customer-provided equipment is merely 
potential and not real or actual.  This is simply not true.  In fact, our experience is clearly to the contrary.  For example, 
current studies [the ""Hunt Studies""] indicate that intercity private line serving links equipped with at least one customer-
provided terminal generated trouble reports at a rate at least 50 percent higher than did serving links equipped with "
66,," telephone company-provided terminals only.  The studies now in progress on message telephone lines are showing like 
results -- the trouble report rate for lines equipped with customer-provided terminals is more than 25 percent higher than 
lines connected solely to telephone company-provided terminals. As we have previously reported to this Commission with 
respect to interstate voice grade private line data services, where the same minimum protection criteria apply as on the 
public switched telecommunications network, a sizable percentage (8.5 percent) of the customers utilizing their own data 
transmitting equipment were applying signal power in excess of the established network protective criteria, thereby 
degrading the service of other customers. The same survey showed, in the case of a particular type of connection or 
interface which is comparable to that encountered on public switched network services, that 18 percent of the customer-
provided terminals violated the minimum network protection criteria by a substantial degree. The comments did state, however, that: Complete and exhaustive statistics demonstrating all the harms from uncontrolled interconnection or the total impact on the 
quality of service might not be obtainable, given the nature of the problem studied.  Certain effects simply are not 
measurable.  How many wrong numbers or how much crosstalk occurs from the use of customer-provided terminals can 
only be observed at the time of or during their occurrence.  The difficulties in making such measurements are apparent.  
However, the data cited above are sufficiently consequential to suggest that interconnection has an adverse impact on the 
quality of service.  Certainly, for the reasons set forth in these comments, further loosening of interconnection policies, such 
as customer options embodied in the certification proposal before the Commission in this proceeding, is not in the public 
interest and should not be adopted. (Footnote omitted)."
66,9," AT&T claims that no equipment available at that time met the standards of the ""barrier PBX"" posited by the Advisory 
Committee and suggests that the concept was approved over its objection by non-AT&T chairpersons of Advisory Committee 
subcommittees.  See AT&T Brief at 19-20 n.24."
66,10," Elaborating some of the concerns expressed by deButts in his earlier speech, the comments stated: The public interest . . . . will inevitably be impaired by the duplication of facilities and the division of responsibility that will 
ensue from further interconnection in an industry where compatibility of components and precise coordination of process 
are crucial.  Interconnection has had an adverse impact on the innovative process in the telephone industry and the impact 
of certification would be even more detrimental. . . . . Any program of certification would, in our view, inevitably lead to the uncontrolled connection of customer-provided 
equipment to the telecommunications network. The ability to allocate responsibility for network performance would perforce 
be destroyed. "
67,11," The finding of predatory or anticompetitive conduct was based in part on ""opposing certification in bad faith."" Other such 
conduct initially found was ""bad faith refusal to sell inside wiring at all or on a reasonable basis."" After returning its initial verdict, at which time the jury could not agree on whether the interface device tariff had been filed in 
bad faith and whether there had been ""bad faith delay in making cutovers,"" the jury further deliberated at the court's request 
and found for Litton on these issues as well: hence our use of the term ""a principal special finding."""
67,12," AT&T claims that certain FCC proceedings occurring prior to the adoption of certification standard regulations had the effect of 
placing the FCC's imprimatur upon the PCA requirement.  See Telerent Leasing Corp., 45 F.C.C.2d 204 (1974), aff'd sub nom.  
North Carolina Utilities Comm'n v. FCC, 537 F.2d 787 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1027, 50 L. Ed. 2d 631, 97 S. Ct. 651 
(1976); AT&T-Mebane Home Telephone Co., 53 F.C.C.2d 473 (1975). It is difficult to see how either of these decisions can be 
read to qualify the FCC's earlier, explicit statement that it was not approving the proposed tariffs, however.  Telerent was a 
declaratory judgment order expressing the Commission's disapproval of a state utility commission's proposed rule that would 
absolutely prohibit the interconnection of customer-provided equipment on any intrastate portion of the telephone network. The 
Commission held that the proposed rule was contrary to the thrust of Carterfone and recently instituted proceedings considering 
the possibility of liberalizing the post-Carterfone tariffs. In Mebane a local telephone company sought exemption from so much of 
the post-Carterfone tariffs as allowed interconnection of customer-provided equipment.  Although the Commission upon its own 
motion granted the local carrier an opportunity to demonstrate the need for a waiver from the tariffs on the basis of economic 
injury, it specifically ruled that, under Carterfone, customers must generally be allowed to provide their own equipment."
67,13," The appeal covered both the First and Second Report and Order in Docket No. 19528.  56 F.C.C.2d 593 (1975); 58 F.C.C.2d 
736 (1976). The latter related to key systems and PBXs.  See 552 F.2d at 1044. "
68,14," Litton claims in its brief that this report was prepared by a Mr. Byers.  This appears to be the case; although the copy of the 
report in the appendix is unsigned, Byers' initials are typed in at the top.  In any event AT&T does not dispute Litton's attribution 
of the report. "
69,15," The task force report said, inter alia: An attempt to design an interface, or a family of interfaces, sufficient to minimize all adverse effects of customer-provided 
equipment poses an economic and administrative problem . . . . Such an interface device would be priced at a level of at 
least what our existing equipment offering is now.  This would, of course, result in what effectively might be considered to 
be an unjustified economic restriction in allowing a customer to provide his own device.  And the provision of an interface 
does not, in itself, necessarily provide the full protection we desire . . . . The report also stated: ""In general, the arguments against the provision of an interface remain the same, i.e., redundancy, 
artificial economic barrier to the customer, impracticalities of administration, doubtful acceptance of customers, etc."" The task 
force, in making its report to the Tariff Review Group explicitly rejected the interface device requirement and specifically 
endorsed technical standards: The entire concept of customer-owned equipment must be based on tariff type-approval of all terminal equipment, wiring, 
and apparatus, rather than on interfaces that would attempt to provide the degree of safety, quality of service, and flexibility 
for future services that we may wish to provide.  The provision, by the Bell System, of families of interfaces for specific 
devices or of one interface, sophisticated enough to work with all services, would erect a redundant, artificial and economic 
barrier to those wishing to purchase their own equipment."
69,16," See the minutes of Tariff Review Group meeting of July 11, 1968 noting that members Cohen, North, and Miller ""feel and 
expressed themselves that current tariff efforts, particularly with respect to interconnection, is [sic] not at all responsive to FCC 
Carterfone decision."" "
70,17," The monthly charge for the AT&T interface device was about $6.00, as compared to a residential phone rental rate of about 
$1.25 a month.  Litton claims that the PCA requirement increased its Key Systems customers' costs by some 18 to 35 percent, 
depending on the size and type of installation, over what they would have been in the absence of the requirement.  In the PBX 
Systems market, Litton claims the PCA requirement increased its customers' costs by 8 to 20 percent.  Litton Brief at 48-49. "
71,18," Litton's market strategy as outlined in its 1971 Business Telephone Systems Interconnect Opportunity Plan comprised three 
essential steps.  The first step involved the creation of an extensive distribution and service network covering major metropolitan 
areas.  In this first stage Litton planned to sell reliable terminal equipment manufactured by established firms while it continued 
its own research and development efforts.  In the second stage, Litton planned to introduce its own equipment to customers. In 
the third and final stage, the sales and distribution network would be expanded to cover the entire country, at which time Litton 
would sell and distribute its own products nationwide. "
72,19," The practice has been described as ""usually preferable to the opaque general verdict."" Skidmore v. Baltimore & Ohio RR. Co., 
167 F.2d 54, 67 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 335 U.S. 816, 93 L. Ed. 371, 69 S. Ct. 34 (1948). See also Wright, The Use of Special 
Verdicts in Federal Court, 38 F.R.D. 199, 206 (1966) (submission of special verdicts can serve to clarify confusing or 
complicated litigation)."
72,20," Indeed, if the jury had found against Litton on the proximate cause question relating to the attempted monopolization charge, 
the trial court judge might reasonably have inferred that this was inconsistent with the jury's general verdict and damage award.  
The record indicates that this possibility was of some concern to both the trial court judge and the attorneys for both parties.  In 
light of the express provision in Fed. R. Civ. P. 49(b) that a trial court may ""return the jury for further consideration of its answers 
and verdict"" in order to eliminate any inconsistencies between a general verdict and special findings, we do not see how it can 
be error to ""return the jury for further consideration"" of an interrogatory it did not answer."
72,21," Specifically, the jury found against Litton on its claim that AT&T engaged in a conspiracy to monopolize (claim three) and in a 
conspiracy to restrain trade (claim four). "
73,22," The trial court judge praised the jury at the close of the trial as follows: Not a single juror has missed a single day because of illness or any other personal matter . . . . That is absolutely amazing . 
. . . You have also been the most punctual jury I have ever had . . . . You have been a vindication of the jury system and all 
that it means."
73,23," AT&T's argument that the jury had no incentive to find against Litton on one claim because it had found for Litton on another is 
a criticism that can be made whenever a plaintiff's case involves multiple claims, any one of which would be sufficient to support 
a damage award.  Thus viewed, AT&T's position is more an indictment of the jury system than an argument against 
resubmission."
73,24," AT&T's contention that the trial court judge ""pressured"" the jury into resolving the undecided questions in Litton's favor is 
based on the following instruction: Any question that is left unanswered creates a possible problem for the parties and the Court.  I don't need to give you 
specific examples of that.  It is a fact that we would like positive answers of either 'yes' or 'no ' to the questions, if you can 
possibly agree after discussing the matter again . . . . to see whether or not you can't in good conscience adopt [the views 
of other jurors] as your own.  It will clear up a lot of problems for us if you can. (Emphasis added.) This instruction correctly emphasized both the importance of reaching a verdict and the necessity of doing so only in accordance 
with the conscientiously held views of each juror.  If the trial court judge had elaborated upon the ""possible problem"" -- i.e., 
inconsistency between a general verdict in Litton's favor and negative finding on the attempted monopolization proximate cause 
question -- we might be inclined to agree with AT&T that the effect could be to bias the jury.  But this is precisely the effect that 
the trial court judge avoided by phrasing the instruction as he did."
73,25," We note that under the trial court judge's instructions the jury could have, but did not, increase the damages it previously 
awarded Litton.  Empirically, this undercuts AT&T's contention that the jury was predisposed to find against it. "
74,26," See 365 U.S. at 132 n.6. See generally, Fischel, Antitrust Liability for Attempts to Influence Governmental Action: The Basis 
and Limits of the Noerr-Pennington Doctrine, 45 U. Chi. L. Rev. 80, 82-84 (1977)."
74,27," The Court was concerned that construing the Sherman Act to reach essentially political activity would hamper the ""ability of 
the people to make their wishes known to their representatives,"" 365 U.S. at 137, thus invoking a traditional First Amendment 
theme.  See also id. at 138; A. Meiklejohn, Political Freedom 26-28 (1948); Bork, Neutral Principles and Some First Amendment 
Problems, 47 Ind. L.J. 1 (1971)."
74,28," The conduct challenged in Pennington included efforts to induce the TVA, a government corporation, to curtail its purchases of 
coal at reduced prices on the spot market.  The Supreme Court did not address the issue, but some lower courts have 
concluded Noerr-Pennington does not immunize anticompetitive efforts directed at government agencies acting in a proprietary 
capacity -- i.e., as buyers or sellers.  See, e.g., Sacramento Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. Chauffeurs, Teamsters & Helpers Local 
No. 150, 440 F.2d 1096, 1099 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 826, 30 L. Ed. 2d 54, 92 S. Ct. 57 (1971); George R. Whitten Jr.,

Fifth Circuit case, and a district court decision in the Third Circuit, are contra.  See Household Goods Carriers' Bureau v. Terrell, 
452 F.2d 152 (5th Cir. 1971) (reh. en banc); United States v. Johns-Manville Corp., 259 F. Supp. 440 (E.D. Pa. 1966). "
75,29," 404 U.S. at 510-11. The California Motor Transport Court squarely held that First Amendment rights of petition and association 
underlay the Noerr-Pennington doctrine.  The Noerr Court only went so far as to suggest that an interpretation of the Sherman 
Act contrary to the one it adopted ""would raise important constitutional questions."" 365 U.S. at 138."
75,30," See, e.g., 14 C.F.R. § 221.3 (1982) (Civil Aeronautics Board) (requiring all domestic and foreign air carriers to file ""tariffs 
showing all rates, fares, and charges"" for air transportation); 18 C.F.R. § 35.1(a) (1982) (Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission) (requiring ""every public utility [to] file . . . . full and complete rate schedules . . . . setting forth all rates and charges

domestic offshore carrier [to] file . . . . tariffs showing its actual rates, fares and charges"").  Filing requirements like those cited 
above and those imposed by the FCC under 47 C.F.R. § 61 et seq. (1981) hearken back to the original justification for 
administrative regulation of industries affected with a public interest: preventing discrimination on the basis of price or terms of 
service.  See generally Jaffe, The Effective Limits of the Administrative Process: A Reevaluation, 67 Harv. L. Rev. 1105, 1106-

76,31," See also United States v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 524 F. Supp. 1336, 1352-53 (D.D.C. 1981) (analyzing 
AT&T's monopoly over local telephone service in terms of the ""essential facility"" or ""strategic bottleneck"" doctrine)."
76,32," Under applicable federal regulations, AT&T could have at any time revoked the interface tariff on its own initiative by filing 
another tariff. 47 C.F.R. § 61.57(a) (1981).  We concluded almost ten years ago in American Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. 
FCC, 487 F.2d 865, 871-76 (2d Cir. 1973) that sections 203 and 205 of the Communications Act of 1934 contemplated ""carrier 
initiated rate changes"" that the FCC could set aside only in the manner prescribed by the statute itself.  The obverse of this, of 
course, is that a tariff is an independent exercise of the carrier's business judgment that receives no government imprimatur until 
and unless the FCC reviews the tariff in response to a complaint or upon its own initiative.  A number of other courts have 
reached the same conclusion.  See Phonetele, Inc. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 664 F.2d 716, 733, 735 (9th Cir. 
1981) (FCC does not adopt or approve tariff filings it permits to become effective; tariff filings are ""the product of the regulated 
entity's independent initiative and judgment""); Sound, Inc. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 631 F.2d 1324, 1330 (8th 
Cir. 1980) (""Bell, not the FCC, proposes its rates, regulations and restrictions . . . . In filing each tariff, Bell implements its own 
business judgment . . . .""); MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. FCC, 182 U.S. App. D.C. 367, 561 F.2d 365, 374 (D.C. Cir. 1977), 
cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1040, 54 L. Ed. 2d 790, 98 S. Ct. 780, 98 S. Ct. 781 (1978) (""The tariff provisions of the Communications 
Act . . . . embody a considered legislative judgment that carriers should in general be free to initiate . . . . new rates or services . . 
. . unless and until the Commission, after hearing, determines that such rates or practices are unlawful . . . .""). We note that AT&T's argument does not rely on the ""filed tariff"" doctrine of Keogh v. Chicago & Northwestern Ry., 260 U.S. 156, 
162, 67 L. Ed. 183, 43 S. Ct. 47 (1922). See City of Groton v. Connecticut Light & Power Co., 662 F.2d 921, 929 (2d Cir. 1981) 
(""filed tariff"" doctrine inapplicable where regulatory agency expressly refuses to commit itself and tariff is ultimately disapproved). "
77,33," The Court has indicated that in interpreting plurality holdings lower courts should look to the ""narrowest ground"" relied upon in 
a concurring Justice's opinion.  See Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193, 51 L. Ed. 2d 260, 97 S. Ct. 990 (1977); Gregg v. 
Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 169 n. 15, 49 L. Ed. 2d 859, 96 S. Ct. 2909 (1976) (plurality opinion).  Although this rule seems of limited 
utility where, as here, the concurring Justices do not address the issue in question, it seems plausible to assume that if either 
Chief Justice Burger or Justice Blackmun felt there was merit to the Noerr-Pennington argument made by the defendant or 
AT&T as amicus, they would not have concurred in the judgment.  Nor is it entirely clear that the dissenting opinion written by 
Justice Stewart and joined by Justices Powell and Rehnquist would hold AT&T's conduct in this case protected under Noerr-
Pennington. Although the dissenting opinion stated that Parker, Noerr, and Goldfarb [v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572 (1975)] point unerringly 
to the proper disposition of this case . . . . The utility company . . . . engages in two distinct activities: It proposes a tariff and, 
if the tariff is approved, it obeys its terms.  The first action cannot give rise to antitrust liability under Noerr and the second -- 
compliance with the terms of the tariff under the command of state law -- is immune from antitrust liability under Parker and 
Goldfarb."
77,428," U.S. at 624, the tariff in question in Cantor was apparently specifically approved by the state regulatory agency.  Id. at 583. 
In this case, of course, the FCC took pains to state that permitting the tariff to take effect was not to be construed as approval of 
the tariff."
77,34," We note that Chief Justice Burger stated in his concurring opinion that the plurality ""correctly concludes: 'The Commission's 
approval of respondent's decision to maintain such a program does not, therefore, implement any statewide policy. '"" 428 U.S. at 
604. The Eighth Circuit has recently read Cantor as not providing Noerr-Pennington protection for tariff filings.  See City of 
Kirkwood v. Union Electric Co., 671 F.2d 1173, 1181 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1170, 103 S. Ct. 814, 74 L. Ed. 2d 1013 
(1983). See also United States v. Title Insurance Rating Bureau of Arizona, Inc., 517 F. Supp. 1053, 1059-60 (D. Ariz. 1981)."
77,35," We review this evidence in greater depth in our discussion of the sham exception, infra, but we believe that this evidence 
tends to show that the conduct fairly considered under the rubric of ""opposition to certification"" amounted to more than simply an 
expression of AT&T's opinion.  Cf.  City of Kirkwood v. Union Electric Co., 671 F.2d at 1181 (""The Noerr-Pennington doctrine will 
not protect a utility which manipulates the federal and state regulatory processes to achieve anti-competitive results.  It is not for 
expression of opinion that [the plaintiff] seeks to compel [the defendant] to respond in damages, but rather for [the defendant's] 
conduct in the market place.""). "
78,36," We reject the suggestion made in AT&T's brief that the applicability of the sham exception turns on whether a competitor is 
barred from access to administrative agencies or the courts.  The Supreme Court's opinion in California Motor Transport cited 
access barring as one example of the illegal results that might flow from abuse of the administrative process.  One of the 
allegations in California Motor Transport that the Court found sufficient to trigger the sham exception is similar to the one Litton 
made in this case, namely that the defendants ""became 'the regulators of the grants of rights, transfers and registrations. '"" 404 
U.S. at 511. More recent Supreme Court opinions have referred to the sham exception's availability without regard to the 
necessity of ""access barring,"" see, e.g., City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 405, 55 L. Ed. 2d 364, 
98 S. Ct. 1123 (1978); Vendo Co. v. Lektro-Vend Corp., 433 U.S. 623, 635 n. 6, 97 S. Ct. 2881, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1009 (1977) 
(Rehnquist, J., concurring)."
78,37," Cf. Note, Limiting the Antitrust Immunity for Concerted Attempts to Influence Courts and Adjudicatory Agencies: Analogies to 
Malicious Prosecution and Abuse of Process, 86 Harv. L. Rev. 715, 726-35 (1973). "
79,38," The Circuits are split on whether a single claim is sufficient to support application of the sham exception. See Clipper Exxpress 
v. Rocky Mountain Motor Tariff Bureau, Inc., 674 F.2d 1252, 1266-67 & n.24 (9th Cir. 1982) (concluding that a single claim can 
be a sham and citing cases on both sides of the proposition). "
80,39," Professor, now Circuit Judge, Bork has suggested that the antitrust law must develop standards to address the 
anticompetitive effects of litigation and administrative actions instituted solely to harass and injure a competitor's rivals.  See R. 
Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 357 (1978).  The need to ensure that the regulatory processes not be used to thwart competition 
seems all the more pressing where, as here, there is serious doubt regarding whether the process can function at all without the 
regulated entity's full cooperation.  See United States v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 524 F. Supp. at 1359 (former 
Chief of FCC's Common Carrier Bureau testified at trial that FCC may be ""incapable of effectively regulating a company of 
AT&T's size, complexity, and power"")."
80,40," The court's charge on the issue of ""Opposition to Registration"" -- before the Noerr-Pennington defense was mentioned -- was 
as follows: You have also heard about Bell's opposition to proposals made before the FCC that the PCA tariffs be replaced by various 
programs of certifying or registering equipment with the FCC.  The question for your decision is whether Bell's opposition 
was interposed in bad faith for the purpose of excluding competition or whether Bell took this position because it believed 
that the registration proposals being made were not in the public interest and would not provide sufficient protection to Bell 
System employees, customers and the telephone network. AT&T Brief at 63. AT&T correctly argues that a ""purpose of excluding competition"" does not suffice to create antitrust liability.  
The charge went on to say: Many of these actions, if successful, might be harmful to a competitor. Nevertheless, the First Amendment guarantees that 
persons or corporations may participate in good faith efforts to influence the passage or enforcement of laws or government 
regulations or to influence public officials regardless of whether the results of the government action they seek would be 
harmful to competition. "
81,," Id. at 64. AT&T argues that the jury was not given a definition of ""good faith,"" but ""bad faith"" had just been defined as meaning 
""for the purpose of excluding competition."""

patentee's infringement suit prosecuted with knowledge of patent invalidity). We take due note that the charge in MCI Communications Corp. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 708 F.2d 1081 (7th Cir. 1983), 
was put in terms of ""clear and convincing"" proof. "
83,42," AT&T argues that the only evidence was that on three isolated occasions one operating company, Southwestern Bell, chose 
not to sell its cable to Litton but that even as to these instances there was no showing of bad faith on Southwestern Bell's part; 
again the evidence is argued to be insufficient under Berkey. But the former Litton BTS Vice President of Operations said: In installations, we would find that when a customer was having the Bell system removed, the Bell folks would just come in 
like with an axe and just chop up the multipin connector wiring at walls.  Gosh, darndest thing I ever saw.  Just couldn't 
believe people would do that.  That particular thing we tended to get over over a period of time and we ended up up [sic] 
some coordination meetings to try get the Bell folks to leave the premises on a reasonable basis as opposed to one of 
appearing to be mad. He added that: A. It wasn't one customer. It was many many installations where that would occur and I just do not remember. Q. Did you ever observe that situation? A. Yes. Because I couldn't believe it, so I went and looked myself. Q. How often did you do that? A. Twice. Q. When you referred to damage, is it the same damage at each customer's premises? A. The two that I observed was the same damage and that was just going along and cutting the wires at the walls. Q. When you say cutting the wires at the walls, can you be a bit more specific about the nature of the damage? A. Yes. There are pairs of wires that are grouped together in cables and are wrapped in some plastic covering that come to 
a key phone or single phone or whatever, different size connectors.  They would be chopped right off at the wall so you had 
no capability of coming to those wires with your connectors and so forth, even though you might be purchasing a cable from 
them."
83,43," AT&T points to Northeastern Telephone Co. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 651 F.2d 76, 94 (2d Cir. 1981), cert. 
denied, 455 U.S. 943, 102 S. Ct. 1438, 71 L. Ed. 2d 654 (1982), where we set aside a jury verdict because the plaintiff 
""introduce[d] [no] evidence whatsoever"" that an AT&T affiliate provided poor service to the plaintiff's customers after the 
purchase and installation of the plaintiff's terminal equipment.  But Litton's claim is that shortages, missed cutover dates, etc., 
prevented it both from satisfying existing customers and luring prospective customers because it could not ""cutover"" on 
schedule.  Unlike Northeastern, there is evidence in this case to support Litton's claim that the problems associated with delay 
were real. "
84,44," See Northeastern Telephone Co., 651 F.2d at 95 n.28, citing California Computer Products, Inc. v. International Business 
Machines Corp., 613 F.2d 727 (9th Cir. 1979) (holding that no synergistic effect arises from individual allegedly anticompetitive 
practices where proof in numerous critical aspects is utterly lacking). "
86,45," AT&T cites to our decision in City of New York v. Pullman Inc., 662 F.2d 910 (2d Cir. 1981) as support for the proposition that 
a finding made by a government agency for one purpose should be excluded from other proceedings considering the same or 
similar facts because of the undue weight a jury might accord such findings.  In City of New York, however, we affirmed the trial 
court's exclusion of an interim staff report of a government agency because the report was ""by its own terms, . . . . not the final 
report or finding of a government agency within the meaning of [Fed. R. Evid. 803(8) (C)]."" Id. at 914. In the alternative, we noted 
that the trial court judge had not abused his discretion in deciding that admission of the report was inadvisable under Fed. R. 
Evid. 403.  Id. at 915. Here, of course, there is no question that the FCC decisions are within the scope of 803(8) (C). "
87,46," AT&T argues that the jury had no rational basis for apportioning damages as it did because ""the vast majority"" of PCA charges 
could have occurred in years the jury thought it had excluded from consideration.  Brief at 125 & n.117.  This could be correct 
but in the absence of a breakdown we or the jury might just as easily have assumed that the vast majority of charges could have 
occurred in the six years 1973-78 which AT&T says were the years utilized by the jury.  In any event in light of the jury's later 
finding that the PCA tariffs were filed in bad faith the ultimate award seems to err on the low side, if any.  We assume that AT&T 
does not want a retrial limited to this issue."
87,47," An antitrust plaintiff has a duty to mitigate damages.  See Borger v. Yamaha Int'l Corp., 625 F.2d 390, 398-99 (2d Cir. 1980); 
Triebwasser & Katz v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 535 F.2d 1356, 1360 (2d Cir. 1976). But if AT&T is correct that the 
jury's award reflects a six-year period running only from the beginning of 1973 until the end of 1978, when the FCC order setting 
aside the last protective circuitry requirement became final, the damage award was fair.  Moreover, failing to mitigate was an 
affirmative defense which AT&T omitted either to plead or prove. "
89,48," Hexter received his MBA from Harvard University and has taught graduate courses in finance and management at Columbia 
and Yale Universities.  Prior to forming his own firm in 1975, Hexter worked for 15 years with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, an 
investment banking firm, where he served first as an industry analyst and later as the head of that firm's corporate financing, 
investment banking and venture capital division.  Hexter was also familiar with the telecommunications industry as a result of his 
service as a board member of Arcata National Corporation and his study of Litton while he was with Donaldson, Lufkin & 
Jenrette. "
90,49," AT&T suggests that because other groups also opposed certification standards, Litton must prove a negative -- i.e., that this 
opposition had nothing to do with Litton's injury -- in order to recover.  Although Litton was required to prove a ""causal 
connection"" between its injury and AT&T's illegal conduct, it was sufficient to demonstrate that AT&T's conduct was a substantial 
or materially contributing factor.  See, e.g., Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 114 n. 9, 23 L. Ed. 2d 
129, 89 S. Ct. 1562 (1969); Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 702, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777, 82 S. Ct. 
1404 (1962)."
90,50," Indeed, under the profit scheme in Hexter's model, Litton sustained losses in 1972 and 1973.  We also note that Litton 
introduced evidence showing that its early performance in the terminal equipment market exceeded the projections contained in 
the Business Opportunity Plan and that R & D expenditures were increased accordingly. "
91,51," That AT&T's objections go to the weight and not the validity of the evidence used in the study seems plain.  From the more 
than one hundred cost, expense, and other factors Hexter used in his study, AT&T attacks one figure -- bad debts as a 
percentage of sales -- to challenge Hexter's treatment of costs. AT&T's argument that Hexter's model should have somehow 
reflected the fact that 80 per cent of all new businesses are unsuccessful is frivolous. "
92,52," Litton argues that Magistrate Sinclair should have been disqualified from presiding over pretrial discovery because some four 
to seven years prior to this litigation he worked as an associate on a case that eventually resulted in Litton threatening to sue his 
law firm for malpractice.  Our review of the record leads us to agree with Judge Conner that it ""is not reasonably conceivable"" 
that Sinclair was likely to be prejudiced against Litton as a result of this earlier involvement. Litton also argues that it was error to 
assign Magistrate Sinclair the task of conducting an evidentiary hearing on discovery order violations.  While we may agree that 
it would have been better practice to assign this task to another magistrate, Magistrate Sinclair was clearly in the best position to 
review compliance with the 122 discovery orders issued in this case.  The district court reserved to itself the question of what 
sanctions would be imposed for any discovery violations; Sinclair's review of the record did not exceed the scope of authority 
granted to magistrates under 28 U.S.C. § 636(e) (5) (Supp. IV 1980) (magistrate may certify to the district court facts relating to 
""act or conduct which if committed before a judge . . . . would constitute contempt""). "
93,53," Litton contends that the Roberts notes should have been protected as attorney work product under Upjohn Co. v. United 
States, 449 U.S. 383, 66 L. Ed. 2d 584, 101 S. Ct. 677 (1981) (when house counsel and general counsel interviewed middle-
echelon corporate employees regarding possible foreign government bribes, notes of the interviews held privileged as made 
between attorney and client).  But as Litton concedes, Litton Brief at 121, the internal investigation focused on the employees' 
own possible misconduct; they were not speaking on behalf of the corporation or in furtherance of its business.  The ""remote 
possibility"" of criminal litigation involving Litton itself was not sufficient to create a work-product immunity, Garfinkle v. Arcata 
Nat'l Corp., 64 F.R.D. 688, 690 (S.D.N.Y. 1974). "
106,1," They consist of the Factor's Lien Contract (Exhibit A), Note (Exhibit B), Continuous and Unlimited Guaranty (Exhibit C), and 
Collateral Agreement (Exhibit D). "
107,2," ""As requested"" in the courts of Puerto Rico is the equivalent of ""Granted and so ordered"" in federal court. "
108,3," The incident involved a motion to intervene filed by a creditor of Nesglo, Albert E. Rebel & Associates, Inc. (""Rebel"") that 
claimed a preference in its credit to that of Chase.  Nesglo, Nestor and Gloria intervened to correct some alleged factual 
misrepresentations made by Chase in its petition for certiorari.  The supreme court finally issued an opinion on November 1981 
clarifying the criteria to determine whether Chase's factor's lien credit was of superior rank to that of Rebel. In passing, the court 
considered the state court judgment against Chase to be final, firm and unappealable.  The court did not take into consideration 
Nesglo's averments in its informative motion.  See, Nesglo, Inc. v. Chase Manhattan Bank, 81 JTS 108 (1981)."
108,4," By this date, the state court had dismissed Nesglo's May 6, 1980 counterclaim and had denied reconsideration of its order. "
109,5," The procedure used by the Supreme Court in this case to determine mootness -- whether a live case or controversy has 
ceased to exist between the parties on appeal -- closely resembles the procedure used herein by the First Circuit Court of 
Appeals. 415 U.S. at 306. "
110,6," In Kremer the Court held that a state court judgment upholding a state agency's rejection of an employment discrimination 
claim, which would have res judicata effects in the state's own courts, precludes a federal action under Title VII of the 1964 Civil 
Rights Act on the same claim of employment discrimination.  In so doing, the Court considerably narrowed the scope of judicial 
exceptions to the preclusive command of 28 U.S.C. Se. 1738 in the context of relitigation of federal claims originally filed and 
disposed of in state courts."
110,7," Rodriguez v. Baldrich, 628 F.2d 691 (1st Cir. 1980) (judgment of dismissal on res judicata grounds vacated and remanded to 
district court for clarification of Puerto Rican law on res judicata effect in federal court of a state court dismissal for failure to post 
a nonresident cost bond)."
110,8," Perez v. Bauza, 83 P.R.R. 213, 217-218 (1961). "
111,9," According to Perez v. Bauza, supra, as interpreted by Baldrich, res judicata in Puerto Rico has the same contours that it has in 
federal law for it ""relieve/s/ parties of the cost and vexation of multiple lawsuits, conserves judicial resources, and, by preventing 
inconsistent decisions, encourages reliance on adjudication"".  Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 94, 66 L. Ed. 2d 308, 101 S. Ct. 
411 (1980)."
111,10," As pointed out in Baldrich, supra, 508 F. Supp. at 615, n. 1, the Puerto Rico Rules of Civil Procedure of 1958 were repealed in 
1979 by the Rules of Civil Procedure of 1979.  Rule 39.2 was reenacted as Rule 39.2(c) and its text, insofar as pertinent here, is 
identical to that of its predecessor.  See, 32 L.P.R.A. App. 111, p. 162 (1980).  This rule is virtually identical to Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 
41(b) governing involuntary dismissals.  In 1943 it was also known as Rule 41(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure of Puerto Rico, 
1943, and such is the reference in the Bauza passage reproduced above."
111,11," In dismissing complaints for failure to comply with discovery orders the trial courts of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico seem 
to enjoy the same discretionary latitude as federal district courts.  Orderly administration of justice in this sense is identical both 
in the state and federal systems.  See, e.g., Corchado v. Puerto Rico Marine Management, 665 F.2d 410 (1st Cir. 1981) (circuit 
court underscores that dismissals with prejudice for failure to comply with discovery orders will ordinarily be upheld as being 
within sound discretion of trial court)."
111,12," See, generally, 18 C. Wright, A. Miller & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure, Civil: Sec. 4440, at 362-365 (1981). "
112,13," In Puerto Rico it is common practice to refer to all defendants or the defendants in general as ""the party defendant"" (literal 
translation).  If a particular defendant or plaintiff is to be singled out then he or she or it (if a corporation) is expressly identified in 
the pleadings. "
113,14," As explained by this court in Wong v. Key Finance Corporation, 266 F. Supp. 149, 153, 154 (D.P.R. 1967), the words ""joint"" or 
""jointly"" in English are the equivalent of ""solidaria"" or ""solidariamente"" in Spanish, which in the case of multiple debtors or 
guarantors, means that any of them are liable for the entire sums owed.  The Code also confers standing on solidary debtors to 
""utilize, against the claim of the creditor, all the exceptions arising from the nature of the obligation and those which are personal 
to him"".  Article 1101, 31 L.P.R.A. Sec. 3112.  Sureties binding themselves jointly (solidarily) with the principal debtor are 
treated, according to the Code, as principal solidary debtors subject to the provisions found in Article 1090-1101, 31 L.P.R.A. 
Secs. 3101-3112.  Wong, supra, Id."
113,15," They also had the right to utilize against the claim of Chase, as creditor, all exceptions arising from the nature of the obligation.  
Article 1101."
113,16," The same result would be obtained under the federal res judicata principle as the Supreme Court of the United States 
indicated in a similar context in Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 59 L. Ed. 2d 210, 99 S. Ct. 970 (1979). The Court at 
page 154 quoting from Souffront v. Compagnie des Sucreries, 217 U.S. 475, 486-487, 54 L. Ed. 846, 30 S. Ct. 608, observed 
that ""/O/ne who prosecutes or defends a suit in the name of another to establish and protect his own right or who assists in the 
prosecution or defense of an action in aid of some interest of his own . . . is as much bound . . . as he would be if he had been a 
party to the record."" "
114,17," Plaintiffs themselves characterize Nestor's and Gloria's state court counterclaim as permissive.  Though it is not necessary for 
us to decide whether such counterclaim is permissive or compulsory for purposes of this opinion, certainly this characterization 
shows that plaintiffs were not involuntary defendants hauled into state court against their wishes.  They freely chose their state 
forum and must abide by their conduct even if it implies waiver of a federal forum and its protections.  See, Nash County Board 
of Education v. Biltmore Co., 640 F.2d 484, 492 (4th Cir. 1981), cert. den. 454 U.S. 878, 70 L. Ed. 2d 188, 102 S. Ct. 359, reh.

115,20," As General Foods v. Mass. Dept. of Public Health, supra, 648 F.2d at 785-786 makes clear, in the case of a state court 
judgment deciding federal questions, federal courts must refer to state law on res judicata to comply with the command of 28

remedy to persons suffering business injury as a consequence of an antitrust violation."
117,25," Defendants read the Moitie decision as signaling the demise of the judicially created doctrine of exclusive federal judicial 
jurisdiction in antitrust cases.  See Nash, supra, 640 F.2d 492, n. 13. They argue that inasmuch as the Supreme Court acted on 
an action removed from state court, if the pleadings, as the court stated, merely reproduced the initial federal antitrust claims 
originally filed in the district court, then the state court had no subject matter jurisdiction over the action and the district court 
could acquire none on removal.  General Investment Co. v. Lake Shore & M.S.R. Co., 260 U.S. 261, 288, 67 L. Ed. 244, 43 S. 
Ct. 106 (1922) (federal court must dismiss for want of jurisdiction federal antitrust action originally filed in state court and 
subsequently removed to the former court).  See also, Blumenstock Bros. Adv. Agency v. Curtis Pub. Co., 252 U.S. 436, 64 L. 
Ed. 649, 40 S. Ct. 385 (1920); Freeman v. Machine Co., 319 U.S. 448, 451, 87 L. Ed. 1509, 63 S. Ct. 1146, n. 6 (1943); but see, 
Testa v. Katt, 330 U.S. 386, 389-394, 91 L. Ed. 967, 67 S. Ct. 810 (1947) (state court is obligated under supremacy clause, to 
enforce private treble damage remedy -- similar to that in antitrust laws -- found in Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, as 
amended, regardless whether it be considered ""penal"" in nature).  A remand was thus in order and the res judicata question 
need not have been decided.  A careful review of the Moitie Supreme Court decision reveals that indeed the court was aware of 
the removal problem, but nevertheless chose to entertain the res judicata arguments.  Moitie, supra, 452 U.S. at 397, n. 2. While defendants' arguments certainly bear weight, we find it unnecessary to reach this issue on the present record.  Whether or 
not the state court here had subject matter jurisdiction of the federal claims before this court, is really immaterial in view of the 
opportunities available to the plaintiffs to redress any jurisdictional errors within the state court system. We remain unpersuaded that Congress intended to vest federal courts with jurisdiction exclusive of that of state courts to 
entertain private treble damage actions under the Tie-in Amendments, especially, under the criteria set forth in Gulf Offshore 
Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 449 U.S. 1033, 66 L. Ed. 2d 494, 101 S. Ct. 607, to determine whether a congressional grant of federal 
jurisdiction displaces state court jurisdiction over the same federal claims: "
118,1, ) an explicit statutory directive;
118,2," ) an unmistaken implication from legislative history, and"
118,3," ) a clear incompatibility between state court jurisdiction and federal interests. Aside from the fact that in the case of Tie-in Amendments, there is no explicit statutory directive or legislative history permitting 
an inference of exclusive jurisdiction -- the contrary is just the situation as embodied in 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1978 -- we fail to perceive 
a clear incompatibility between state court jurisdiction and the commercial interests sought to be protected by Congress in the 
amendments.  The broad traditional regulatory power of banking by the states, taken into consideration by Congress in enacting 
the Tie-in Amendments, certainly makes entertainment of such federal claims by state courts conducive to the enforcement of 
federal rights.  Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corp., supra; Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney, 368 U.S. 502, 507-508, 7 L. Ed. 2d 
483, 82 S. Ct. 519 (1962) (concurrent jurisdiction of state courts upheld in actions under Section 301 of the Labor Management 
Relations Act). Certainly, the courts of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are not foreign to broad antitrust private treble damage 
remedies to redress unfair methods of competition of the type pressed by plaintiffs in this court.  See, the Puerto Rico Monopoly 
Act, Act No. 77 of June 25, 1964, as amended, 10 L.P.R.A. Secs. 257 et seq., especially Secs. 259(a) and 262) (Unfair 
Methods of Competition and Exclusive Dealing).  The act explicitly vests on the Superior Court of Puerto Rico jurisdiction to 
entertain private treble damage suits in 10 L.P.R.A. Sec. 268(a)."

119,29," Even if this were a case of exclusive federal judicial jurisdiction, the equities would tend to favor enforcement of traditional res 
judicata preclusion inasmuch as there is simply no need to assess whether uniform national policy in antitrust enforcement 
would be affected given the voluntary conduct of plaintiffs in state court in refusing to comply with state judicial procedure.  If 
anything, an interest in uniform and proper administration of justice should prevail, and in this instance, the state court judgment 
fosters this interest the same way as any federal judgment in similar circumstances would."
119,30," As mentioned previously, in arriving at our findings and conclusions, we have relied in part on our familiarity with Puerto Rican 
substantive and procedural law.  In any event, as respects civil procedure, the Puerto Rican rules are very similar to and 
sometimes identical with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  This identity exists in the area of dismissals for failure to comply 
with discovery orders."

144,1," Transamerica also challenges a number of jury instructions, arguing that because this was a jury trial and because there was no waiver of the jury, this Court has the same duty to review the 
instructions and if erroneous and prejudicial, to reverse the judgment below as it would in any other jury trial. Transamerica Brief at 27. Transamerica, however, freely and unconditionally stipulated before trial that the district court would decide the case if the jury 
was unable to reach a verdict. The stipulation was intended to avoid the expense of a retrial. 10/20/78 Tr. 8-10; 11/17/78 Tr. 18-
20. By so stipulating, Transamerica agreed to a court trial if the jury deadlocked, and thus instructions given to the deadlocked 
jury are irrelevant to this appeal. "
145,2," This court has stated that in determining whether a defendant's conduct constitutes the willful acquisition or maintenance of

have said that to determine whether defendant's conduct constitutes the kind of predatory or anticompetitive action required for 
the offense of attempt to monopolize, ""individual conduct is measured against the same 'reasonableness' standard."" Id. at 737. "
146,3," At trial, IBM presented evidence that the prices challenged by Transamerica were above average total cost. Transamerica

court held that the adjustments were inappropriate.  Transamerica Computer, 481 F. Supp. at 998-1001. Transamerica does not 
appeal this ruling. Transamerica also asked the district court to include ""impact costs"" in calculating IBM's profits. Impact costs are the ""reduction in 
anticipated future profits on an existing product line caused by the introduction of a new product line."" In re IBM Peripheral EDP 
Devices Litigation, Transamerica Computer Co. Inc. v. IBM, 459 F. Supp. 626, 631 (N.D. Cal. 1978). The district court ruled 
before trial that impact costs should not be included in calculating total costs because to do so would create a disincentive to 
research and innovation and because impact costs are difficult to calculate. Id. Despite this pre-trial ruling, Transamerica was "
147,," allowed to introduce evidence of impact costs. Transamerica Brief at 21, 50; 72 Tr. 12445-519, 73 Tr. 12541-47, 12568-97, 
12614-19, 12645-50, 12666-87. Transamerica does not contend on appeal that it was precluded from introducing any evidence 
on impact costs.  Although evidence of impact costs was before the district court, it did not discuss such costs in reaching its 
findings of fact on Transamerica's predatory pricing claim. On appeal, Transamerica contends the district court committed 
prejudicial error in foreclosing consideration of impact costs. Our review of the record indicates that these costs were speculative.  IBM's old products were also being displaced by products 
produced by PCMs.  While IBM might have ""lost"" profits through the introduction of new products, it arguably would have lost 
more without the new products. The profits that Transamerica claims IBM could have reaped from its old products might never 
have been realized by IBM because of competition from the PCMs. In these circumstances, we cannot say that the district court 
was clearly erroneous in not including impact costs in its calculations. But see Ordover and Willig, An Economic Definition of 
Predation: Pricing and Product Innovation, 91 Yale L.J. 8, 26 n. 49 (1981). We do not foreclose the possibility that impact costs 
ought to be considered when appropriate."

Ed. 2d 349, 96 S. Ct. 1411 (1976). The Areeda-Turner test also generated a number of counter proposals for evaluating predatory pricing. Sullivan, for example, 
suggests that courts look to ""human animus"" in market conduct. He would focus on the ""traces"" a predator leaves behind, such 
as documents containing information about competitors. Sullivan, Economics and More Humanistic Disciplines: What are the 
Sources of Wisdom for Antitrust?, 127 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1214, 1229-30, 1232 (1977). Joskow and Klevorick suggest a complex cost-based test in which market structure is considered and the defendants have a 
greater burden to produce documentation of their costs. Joskow & Klevorick, A Framework for Analyzing Predatory Pricing 
Policy, 89 Yale L.J. 213 (1979). Williamson considers output a more important factor than cost or price.  He would prohibit a monopolist confronted with a new 
competitor from increasing its output for twelve to eighteen months. This restraint would diminish as the entrant gained 
experience and economies of scale.  Williamson, Predatory Pricing, 87 Yale L.J. 284 (1977). For the most recent discussion of these ideas and the Areeda-Turner test see Note, Predatory Pricing: The Retreat From the

not ""truly reflect marketplace realities and provide for anticompetitive behavior."" He also noted that even Areeda and Turner ""are

151,16," Predatory pricing should not be countenanced merely because it would be difficult to detect in situations where price exceeds

151,18," At trial, Transamerica was not precluded from introducing evidence of predatory pricing. The district court's ruling that prices 
above average total cost are per se legal was made after the trial concluded."
151,19," While Transamerica contends that it proved that IBM engaged in limit pricing, the evidence suggests otherwise. Limit pricing 
exists where entry barriers are ""great enough to prevent other entry,"" Hanson, 541 F.2d at 1358 n.5, or are ""extremely high,"" 
Pierce Packing Co.  v. John Morrell & Co., 633 F.2d 1362, 1366 (9th Cir. 1980). Here, the district court found that the entry 
barriers to the peripherals market were ""extraordinarily low."" Transamerica Computer, 481 F. Supp. at 987. Further, a limit price is designed to deter entry into the market. To be limiting, therefore, the price must generally be below 
competitors' prices. Here, ""IBM's prices did not undercut the PCM's prices, they did not even equal them, they merely closed the 
gap; the PCM's prices were still lower."" Id. at 1002. The evidence also suggests that IBM's prices did not have a limiting effect. A number of companies entered the peripherals 
market and took substantial business from IBM.  Id. at 986. The early success of the PCMs suggests that no limit pricing 
occurred. Finally, while CalComp held that ""limit pricing by a monopolist might, on a record which presented the issue, be held an 
impermissible predatory practice,"" 613 F.2d at 743, CalComp found that IBM's prices did not constitute limit pricing but rather 
were a lawful response to competition. Id.  Transamerica's evidence is indistinguishable from CalComp's. As in CalComp, we 
find that the evidence does not indicate that IBM engaged in limit pricing. "
152,1," Noting that ""marginal cost data are typically unavailable,"" Professors Areeda and Turner use average variable cost as a

152,2," Inglis, supra, 668 F.2d 1014, 1035 n.30. Average total cost is, by definition, always higher than average variable cost. See 
Areeda & Turner, supra, note 1, at 700-01. A per se rule tied to average total cost creates, therefore, a smaller area in which 
pricing conduct will be presumed to be legal than a rule tied to average variable cost. (It is true that average variable cost is used 
as a surrogate for marginal cost and that marginal cost can, in some unusual cases, exceed average total cost. Id. Areeda and 
Turner modify their marginal cost rule in these cases, however, to provide that prices below marginal cost are legal if they 
exceed average total cost. Id. at 712-13.) "
153,3," Even Spivak, who disagrees vigorously with the price tests put forward by Areeda and Turner, concedes that where prices are 
above average total cost, courts could ""almost invariably"" decide the predatory pricing issue on cost data alone. See Spivak,

159,2," The Towns brought their antitrust claims under a number of theories.  The first claim was that the City used its monopoly over 
sewage treatment to gain a monopoly over sewage collection and transportation. The second claim was that requiring the 
consumer to obtain sewage and collection services in order to gain sewage treatment services constituted an illegal tying

160,3," During the period from 1943 to 1975, the Supreme Court did not address the state action immunity question.  Since 1975, the 
Court has addressed the issue of immunity under Parker in seven cases.  The Court responded to the concern that states and 
municipalities were sheltering too much conduct that contravened the antitrust laws, such as restrictive licensing practices, state 
action serving as a mask for private cartels, and instances of nominal state regulation in which the state took no active role.  M. 
Handler, Reforming the Antitrust Laws 59 (1982).  There was also the concern that regulated industries control their regulators

160,7," Between the decisions of Lafayette and Boulder, the Supreme Court addressed the issue of state action immunity in California 
Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 100 S. Ct. 937, 63 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1980). The State of "
161,," California by statute required that wine suppliers set dealer resale prices and that dealers sell at those prices.  The Court held 
that two standards must be met if this anticompetitive conduct were to receive antitrust immunity under Parker v. Brown. The 
challenged conduct must be one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as a state policy, and it must be actively 
supervised by the state.  The Court struck down the statutory resale price maintenance scheme because there was no active 
state supervision over the private parties that were given the power to set prices under the statute.  Id. at 105-106, 100 S. Ct. at 
943, 63 L. Ed. 2d at 243."
161,8," The City had enacted a moratorium on the expansion of cable television enterprises for a period of three months to give the 
City Council time to draft a model cable television ordinance and to invite new businesses to enter the market.  The only existing 
cable television company in Boulder, Community Communications, sought injunctive relief to prevent the ordinance enacting the 
moratorium from taking effect."
161,9," See Antitrust Immunity, 95 Harv. L. Rev. at 445-46 (1981): ""The Supreme Court has found it sufficient that 'the legislature 
contemplated the kind of action complained of.' A policy to displace antitrust laws will then be inferred if the challenged restraint 
of competition is a necessary or reasonable consequence of engaging in the authorized activity."" Id. (quoting City of Lafayette,

action complained of.' A policy to displace the antitrust laws will then be found if the challenged restraint of competition is a 
necessary consequence of engaging in the authorized activity."")."
162,11," The court stated in City of Boulder: Moreover, judicial enforcement of Congress' will regarding the state action exemption renders a state ""no less able to 
allocate governmental power between itself and its political subdivisions.  It means only that when the State itself has not 
directed or authorized an anticompetitive practice, the State's subdivision in exercising their delegated power must obey the 
antitrust laws."""

government from providing services on a monopoly basis.  Parker and its progeny make clear that a State properly may . . .

antitrust laws."

Such ordinance shall delineate the area within which service will be provided and the municipal utility shall have no 
obligation to serve beyond the area so delineated.  Such area may be enlarged by a subsequent ordinance. No such 
ordinance shall be effective to limit any obligation to serve which may have existed at the time the ordinance was adopted. We note that HN8[

city or village subject to an order under this section may commence an annexation proceeding under § 66.024 to annex the 
unincorporated territory subject to the order.  If the result of the referendum under § 66.024(4) is in favor of annexation, the 
territory shall be annexed to the city or village for all purposes, and sewerage service shall be extended to the territory 
subject to the order. If an application for an annexation referendum under § 66.024(4) is against the annexation, the order 
shall be void.  If an annexation proceeding is not commenced within the 90-day period, the order shall be effective. HN10[
] The constitutionality of § 144.07(lm) was upheld in City of Beloit v. Kallas, 76 Wis.2d 61, 250 N.W.2d 342 (1977). The court held the statute balanced and accommodated two matters of state concern: providing vital services to areas surrounding 
cities and the growth or expansion of cities or villages, with annexation as a means to bring all municipal services to areas 
annexed. "
164,15," In the City of Boulder, the Supreme Court left open the question whether a municipality must show active state supervision 
over its conduct in order to receive immunity under Parker v. Brown: ""Because we conclude in the present case that Boulder's 
moratorium ordinance does not satisfy the 'clear articulation and affirmative expression' criterion, we do not reach the question 
whether that ordinance must or could satisfy the 'active state supervision' test focused upon in Midcal."" City of Boulder, 455 U.S. 
at 51 n.14, 102 S. Ct. at 841 n.14, 70 L. Ed. 2d at 819 n.14. In Pueblo Aircraft Service v. City of Pueblo, 679 F.2d 805 (10 Cir. 1982), the Court did not require active state supervision for the 
City of Pueblo to receive Parker v. Brown immunity. The conduct in this case involved the City's operation of a municipal airport.  
The Court concluded that the key inquiry was whether the State of Colorado by affirmative legislative action granted the City an 
exemption from the operation of the antitrust laws by virtue of statutory language giving municipalities the authority to acquire 
and operate a municipal airport.  Under this standard, the Court held the City's conduct to be exempt from the antitrust laws."
164,16," See P. Areeda, Antitrust Law § 212.2a, at 47 (Supp. 1982) (""Thus, requiring state authorization for local conduct is 
analogous to requiring active supervision of private conduct; it tests whether challenged local activity is truly state action and 
therefore entitled to immunity.""); Antitrust Immunity, 95 Harv. L. Rev. at 445 & n.49 (""Lafayette does not require that government 
acts . . . . be supervised by the state."") (""a few courts erroneously appear to use the Midcal formula (clearly articulated state 
policy plus active public supervision of private parties) to require state supervision of governmental defendants""); Rogers, "

active state supervision is necessary for political subdivisions to gain Parker immunity, however, in spite of the seemingly 
unequivocal language of California Retail Liquor.""). For an argument that the Supreme Court should abandon the active state 
supervision requirement completely, see Page, Antitrust, Federalism, and the Regulatory Process: A Reconstruction and 
Critique of the State Action Exemption After Midcal Aluminum, 61 B.U.L.Rev. 1099 (1981)."
165,17," See City of Boulder, 455 U.S. at 71 n.6, 102 S. Ct. at 851 n.6, 70 L. Ed. 2d at 831 n.6 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (""The Court 
understandably avoids determining whether local ordinances must satisfy the 'active state supervision' prong of the Midcal test.  
It would seem rather odd to require municipal ordinances to be enforced by the State rather than the city itself."")"
165,18," We reserve the question whether a municipality undertaking anticompetitive activity that falls outside the scope of a traditional 
governmental function must be actively supervised by the state to receive Parker v. Brown immunity. This reflects our belief that 
HN13[
] traditional municipal activity undertaken pursuant to clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy and 
designed to promote public health and safety should be free from antitrust attack.  When municipal activity strays from these 
functions, which includes the provision of basic services such as sewerage and sanitation, there is a more significant threat to 
free competition that may warrant active state supervision. See The Supreme Court, 1981 Term, 96 Harv.L.Rev. 62, 171-273

the Associated General Contractors of America, Inc.; and by Edward B. Miller and Stephen A. Bokat for the Chamber of

Industrial Organization as amicus curiae urging affirmance. Kenneth E. Ristau, Jr., and David A. Cathcart filed a brief for the Pacific Maritime Association as amicus curiae. "
175,1," The facts set forth in paragraphs 23 and 24, initially alleged in support of the Union's federal antitrust claim, are realleged in 
each of the other claims for relief: breach of collective-bargaining agreements (PMPM 29-31); intentional interference with 
contractual relations (PMPM 32-35); intentional interference with business relationships (PMPM 36-39); and violation of the 
California antitrust statute (PMPM 40-43)."
175,2," For example, it is alleged that defendants breached their collective-bargaining agreements ""by failing to pay agreed-upon 
wages, by failing to use the hiring hall, by failing to pay Trust Fund contributions, by failing to observe other terms and conditions 
of employment, and by generally weakening the good faith requirement of the collective bargaining agreements""; that 
defendants improperly changed their names and corporate status and made use of so-called ""double breasted operations""; and 
that they encouraged nonmembers of Associated to refuse to enter into collective-bargaining agreements with the Union. "
176,3," The word ""coerced"" did not appear in the complaint as originally filed.  Even as amended after the filing of motions to dismiss, 
the complaint does not allege that the defendants used any coercion to persuade nonmembers of Associated to refuse to enter 
into collective-bargaining agreements with the Union (PM 24(3)).  The complaint alleges neither the identity nor the number of 
landowners, general contractors, or others who were coerced into making contracts with nonunion firms."
176,4," Paragraph 25, which describes the effect of the conspiracy, reads in full as follows: ""The purpose and effect of the above described activities, plan and conspiracy are oppressive, unreasonable, and illegal, and 
are in restraint of trade and an unlawful interference and restraint of the free exercise of the business activities of plaintiffs and 
each of them, all in violation of 15 U. S. C. Section 1. The purpose and effect of the above described activities, plan and 
conspiracy, in addition, are to weaken, destroy, and restrain the trade of certain contractors, both members of the Associated 
General Contractors of California, Inc. and non-members, who are 'memorandum contractors,' who have faithfully performed the 
terms and conditions set out in the master collective bargaining agreements described above.  The effect of this restraint on 
trade is to further weaken and destroy plaintiffs in this matter.  These activities are in restraint of the free exercise of plaintiffs' 
trade and an interference therein, all in violation of 15 U. S. C. Section 1."" App. E to Pet. for Cert. 20-21."
176,5," Plaintiffs do not seek injunctive relief under § 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U. S. C. § 26, and they do not ask us to consider 
whether they have standing to request such relief."
176,6," An order dismissing the federal antitrust claim and the state-law claims was filed on August 4, 1975, and an amended order 
dismissing the entire complaint was entered on September 10, 1975.  The District Court had initially stayed the breach-of-
contract claim for 120 days pending grievance and arbitration procedures.  On reconsideration it also dismissed the breach-of-
contract claim, deciding that the suit had been prematurely filed."
176,7," Addressing the federal antitrust claim, the District Court concluded: ""The essence of plaintiffs' claim seems to be that defendants violated the antitrust laws insofar as they declined to enter into 
agreements with plaintiffs to deal only with subcontractors which were signatories to contracts with plaintiffs, precisely the type of 
agreement which subjected the union in Connell to antitrust liability."" 404 F.Supp., at 1070. The District Court reasoned that the employers' refusal to enter into such an agreement could not provide the basis for an 
antitrust claim. "
177,8, The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of all other claims.
177,9," The Court of Appeals majority read subparagraph (4) of paragraph 24, quoted supra, at 522, as though it alleged that the 
defendants had coerced landowners and other persons who let construction contracts ""to hire only construction firms, primarily 
subcontractors, who had not signed with the Unions."" 648 F.2d, at 532 (emphasis added); see also id., at 544 (denying petition 
for rehearing).  The word ""only"" does not appear in the amended complaint, and it implies that the defendants' activities gave 
rise to a broader restraint than was actually alleged. The majority read subparagraph (5) of paragraph 24 to charge that defendants had ""coerced and aided each other to 
subcontract only with subcontractors who had not signed with the Unions."" Id., at 531 (emphasis added).  Again using the word 
""only,"" which does not appear in the complaint itself, the majority characterized the defendants' alleged activities as ""very similar 
to a concerted refusal to deal, or a group boycott."" Ibid.  It concluded that the allegations ""present virtually the obverse of the 
situation described in Connell"": the conspiracy, if successful, ""would effectively lock union-signatory subcontractors out of a 
portion of the market for carpentry work."" Id., at 532."
177,10," See Tugboat, Inc. v. Mobile Towing Co., 534 F.2d 1172, 1176-1177 (CA5 1976); International Assn. of Heat & Frost 
Insulators v. United Contractors Assn., 483 F.2d 384, 397-398 (CA3 1973). Circuit Judge Sneed dissented.  He first rejected the majority's characterization of the complaint, agreeing instead with the 
District Court.  Second, assuming that the complaint alleged a boycott of certain employers, he concluded that neither the 
employees of a victim of the boycott nor their collective-bargaining representative had standing to assert the antitrust claim. 
Finally, he concluded that an injury that affected only the Union's organizational and representational activity was remediable 
under the labor laws rather than the antitrust laws. The Court of Appeals denied the petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc on May 22, 1981.  Accompanying the order was a 
statement by the majority rebutting the petitioners' assertion that the opinion rendered multiemployer bargaining units unlawful, 
and a dissent by Circuit Judge Sneed.  648 F.2d, at 543, 545."
177,11," The Union had an adequate opportunity to amend its pleading to add factual allegations demonstrating that the District Court's 
decision to dismiss the complaint was based on a misunderstanding of its antitrust claim. "
178,12," In analyzing the antitrust allegations in the amended complaint, we therefore construe the references to ""contractors and 
subcontractors who are not signatories to collective bargaining agreements"" as referring to completely independent nonunion 
firms rather than to operations covertly controlled by one or more defendants."
178,13," The Court of Appeals did not reverse the District Court's dismissal of the complaint with regard to these allegations.  648 F.2d, 
at 531-532, 537, 540."
178,14," See Brief for Respondents 37.  There is no allegation of wrongful conduct directed at nonunion subcontracting firms.  We 
therefore assume that, if any nonunion firms refused to bargain with the Union because of the conspiracy, they did so because 
they were rewarded with business they would not otherwise have obtained.  Thus, nonunion firms could not be considered 
victims of the conspiracy; rather, they appear to have been its indirect beneficiaries.  None are named either as defendants or as 
co-conspirators. The amended complaint also does not allege any restraint on competition in the market for labor union services.  Unlike the two 
cases involving union plaintiffs cited by the Court of Appeals, see n. 10, supra, in this case there is no claim that competition 
between rival unions has been injured or even that any rival unions exist."
178,15," The complaint does not specify the nature of the ""coercion."" It does not, for example, allege that the defendants refused to 
deal with all members of either of the two classes of persons against whom coercion was applied.  Indeed, it is highly improbable 
that the defendants -- all of whom are signatories to union contracts -- would refuse to deal with all of their customers and 
potential customers in an attempt to divert all of their business to nonunion firms."
178,16, There is no allegation that any person subjected to coercion was required to deal exclusively with nonunion firms.
178,17," LEdHN[5B][
] [5B] Had the District Court required the Union to describe the nature of the alleged coercion with particularity before ruling on the 
motion to dismiss, it might well have been evident that no violation of law had been alleged.  In making the contrary assumption 
for purposes of our decision, we are perhaps stretching the rule of Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47-48 (1957), too far.  
Certainly in a case of this magnitude, HN3[
] a district court must retain the power to insist upon some specificity in pleading 
before allowing a potentially massive factual controversy to proceed. "
179,18," Although we do not know what kind of coercion defendants allegedly employed, we assume for purposes of decision that it 
had a predatory ""nature or character,"" Klors, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S., at 211, and that it would ""cripple the 
freedom of traders and thereby restrain their ability to sell in accordance with their own judgment."" Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph 
E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U.S. 211, 213 (1951)."
179,19," In Mandeville Island Farms, Inc. v. Sugar Co., 334 U.S. 219 (1948), the Court held that growers of sugar beets could maintain 
a treble-damages action against refiners who had allegedly conspired to fix the price that they would pay for the beets.  Although 
previous price-fixing cases had involved agreements among sellers to fix sales prices, the Court readily concluded that the Act 
applied equally to an agreement among competing buyers to fix purchase prices.  The Court stated: HN7[
] ""The statute does not confine its protection to consumers, or to purchasers, or to competitors, or to sellers. Nor does it 
immunize the outlawed acts because they are done by any of these.  Cf.  United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 
150; American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781. The Act is comprehensive in its terms and coverage, protecting all 
who are made victims of the forbidden practices by whomever they may be perpetrated."" Id., at 236. Similarly broad language was used in later cases holding that actions could be maintained by consumers, Reiter v. Sonotone 
Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 337-338 (1979), by a foreign government, Pfizer Inc. v. India, 434 U.S. 308, 313-314 (1978), and by the 
direct victim of a boycott. Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 472-473 (1982). In each of those cases, however, 
the actual plaintiff was directly harmed by the defendants' unlawful conduct.  The paraphrasing of the language of § 4 in those 
opinions added nothing to the even broader language that the statute itself contains."
179,20," See 21 Cong. Rec. 1767-1768, 2455-2456, 2459, 2615, 3147-3148 (1890).  The original proposal, which merely allowed 
recovery of the amount of actual enhancement in price, was successively amended to authorize double-damages and then 
treble-damages recoveries, in order to provide otherwise remediless small consumers with an adequate incentive to bring suit. "
180,," Id., at 1765, 2455, 3145.  The same purpose was served by the special venue provisions, the provision for the recovery of 
attorney's fees, and the elimination of any requirement that the amount in controversy exceed the jurisdictional threshold 
applicable in other federal litigation.  See, e. g., id., at 2612, 3149.  Moreover, changes in the description of the remedy extended 
the section's coverage beyond price fixing."
180,21," See, e. g., id., at 2456, 2459, 3151-3152."
180,22," Id., at 2456.  Senator Sherman added: ""The purpose of this bill is to enable the courts of the United States to apply the same 
remedies against combinations which injuriously affect the interests of the United States that have been applied in the several 
States to protect local interests."" Ibid.; see also id., at 2459, 3149, 3151-3152.  Although Members of Congress referred 
particularly to common-law definitions of ""monopoly"" and ""restraint of trade,"" they appear to have been generally aware that the 
statute would be construed by common-law courts in accordance with traditional canons.  For example, at the beginning of the 
debate on the Sherman Act, one Senator cautioned his colleagues: ""A careful analysis of the terms of the bill is essential.  We must know what it means, what its legal effect is, if we give force to it 
as it is written. . . .  We must adopt, therefore, the known methods of the courts in determining what the bill means."" Id., at 1765."
180,23," For example, the State Constitution of Illinois, adopted in 1870, provided: ""Every person ought to find a certain remedy in the 
laws for all injuries and wrongs which he may receive in his person, property or reputation. . . ."" Art. II, § 19. Comparable 
provisions were found in the State Constitutions of Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, 
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Vermont.  See generally F. Hough, 
American Constitutions (1871)."
180,24," One treatise stated: ""Natural, proximate, and legal results are all that damages can be recovered for, even under a statute 
entitling one 'to recover any damage.'"" 3 J. Lawson, Rights, Remedies, and Practice 1740 (1890).  Another leading treatise 
explained: ""The chief and sufficient reason for this rule is to be found in the impossibility of tracing consequences through successive steps 
to the remote cause, and the necessity of pausing in the investigation of the chain of events at the point beyond which 
experience and observation convince us we cannot press our inquiries with safety."" T. Cooley, Law of Torts 73 (2d ed. 1888). "
181,25," In torts, a leading treatise on damages set forth the general principle that, ""[where] the plaintiff sustains injury from the 
defendant's conduct to a third person, it is too remote, if the plaintiff sustains no other than a contract relation to such a third 
person, or is under contract obligation on his account, and the injury consists only in impairing the ability or inclination of such 
person to perform his part, or in increasing the plaintiff's expense or labor of fulfilling such contract, unless the wrongful act is 
willful for that purpose."" Thus, A, who had agreed with a town to support all the town paupers for a specific period, in return for a 
fixed sum, had no cause of action against S for assaulting and beating one of the paupers, thereby putting A to increased 
expense.  Similarly, a purchaser under an output contract with a manufacturer had no right of recovery against a trespasser who 
stopped the company's machinery, and a creditor could not recover against a person who had forged a note, causing diminution 
in the dividends from an estate.  1 J. Sutherland, Law of Damages 55-56 (1882) (emphasis in original, footnote omitted). Similarly, in contract, the common-law courts drew a distinction between direct and consequential damages; the latter had to be 
specifically included in the contract to be recoverable.  See id., at 74-93; 1 T. Sedgwick, Measure of Damages 203-244 (8th ed. 
1891) (discussing the rule of Hadley v. Baxendale, 9 Exch. 341, 156 Eng. Rep. 145 (1854))."
181,26," The common law required the plaintiff to prove, with certainty, both the existence of damages and the causal connection 
between the wrong and the injury.  No damages could be recovered for uncertain, conjectural, or speculative losses.  See 
generally cases cited in F. Bohlen, Cases on the Law of Torts 292-312 (2d ed. 1925) (cases alleging emotional harm to plaintiff).  
Even if the injury was easily provable, there would be no recovery if the plaintiff could not sufficiently establish the causal 
connection.  See 1 Sutherland, supra n. 25, at 94-126; 1 Sedgwick, supra n. 25, at 245-294."
181,27," See, e. g., Winterbottom v. Wright, 10 M. & W. 109, 152 Eng. Rep. 402 (Ex. 1842)."
181,28," LEdHN[10B][
] [10B] See n. 22, supra.  The common law, of course, is an evolving body of law.  We do not mean to intimate that the limitations on 
damages recoveries found in common-law actions in 1890 were intended to serve permanently as limits on Sherman Act 
recoveries.  But legislators familiar with these limits could hardly have intended the language of § 7 to be taken literally."
181,29," See also Amex v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 166 F. 820 (CC Mass. 1909). Applying ""ordinary principles of law"" to 
the general language of the statute, the court held that a stockholder had no legally cognizable antitrust claim against 
defendants for illegally acquiring the corporation, thereby rendering plaintiff's stock worthless.  Plaintiff's claim was not 
distinguishable from any injury sustained by the company itself.  Therefore, the court stated, a contrary result would ""subject the 
defendant not merely to treble damages, but to sextuple damages, for the same unlawful act."" Id., at 823."
181,30," The Court held in that case that the plaintiff shippers could recover damages from the defendant railroad for charging an 
excessive freight rate, even though they had been able to pass on the damage to their purchasers. Justice Holmes wrote that 
the law holds the defendant ""liable if proximately the plaintiff has suffered a loss,"" but ""does not attribute remote consequences 
to a defendant."" 245 U.S., at 533-534. "
182,31," LEdHN[11B][
] [11B] The label ""antitrust standing"" has traditionally been applied to some of the elements of this inquiry.  As commentators have 
observed, the focus of the doctrine of ""antitrust standing"" is somewhat different from that of standing as a constitutional doctrine.  
HN10[
] Harm to the antitrust plaintiff is sufficient to satisfy the constitutional standing requirement of injury in fact, but the court 
must make a further determination whether the plaintiff is a proper party to bring a private antitrust action.  See Berger & 
Bernstein, An Analytical Framework for Antitrust Standing, 86 Yale L. J. 809, 813, n. 11 (1977); Pollock, Standing to Sue, 
Remoteness of Injury, and the Passing-On Doctrine, 32 A. B. A. Antitrust L. J. 5, 6-7 (1966)."
182,32," In his comment, Mahoney v. Beatman: A Study in Proximate Cause, 39 Yale L. J. 532, 533 (1930), Leon Green noted: ""Legal 
theory is too rich in content not to afford alternative ways, and frequently several of them, for stating an acceptable judgment."" 
Earlier, in his Rationale of Proximate Cause 135-136 (1927) (footnote omitted), Green had written: ""'Cause,' although irreducible in its concept, could not escape the ruffles and decorations so generously bestowed: remote,

182,33," Some courts have focused on the directness of the injury, e. g., Loeb v. Eastman Kodak Co., 183 F. 704, 709 (CA3 1910); 
Productive Inventions, Inc. v. Trico Products Corp., 224 F.2d 678, 679 (CA2 1955), cert. denied, 350 U.S. 936 (1956); Volasco 
Products Co. v. Lloyd A. Fry Roofing Co., 308 F.2d 383, 394-395 (CA6 1962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 907 (1963). Others have 
applied the requirement that the plaintiff must be in the ""target area"" of the antitrust conspiracy, that is, the area of the economy 
which is endangered by a breakdown of competitive conditions in a particular industry.  E. g., Pan-Islamic Trade Corp. v. Exxon 
Corp., 632 F.2d 539, 546-547 (CA5 1980); Engine Specialties, Inc. v. Bombardier Ltd., 605 F.2d 1, 17-18 (CA1 1979); 
Calderone Enterprises Corp. v. United Artists Theater Circuit, Inc., 454 F.2d 1292, 1292-1295 (CA2 1971). Another Court of 
Appeals has asked whether the injury is ""arguably within the zone of interests protected by the antitrust laws."" Malamud v. 
Sinclair Oil Corp., 521 F.2d 1142, 1151-1152 (CA6 1975). See generally Berger & Bernstein, supra n. 31. "

(""HN11[

183,35," LEdHN[12B][
] [12B] It is well settled that a defendant's specific intent may sometimes be relevant to the question whether a violation of law has been 
alleged.  See United States v. Columbia Steel Co., 334 U.S. 495, 522 (1948). Moreover, there no doubt are cases in which such 
an allegation would adequately support a plaintiff's claim under § 4.  Cf. Handler, supra n. 33, at 30 (specific intent of defendant 
to cause injury to a particular class of persons should ""ordinarily be dispositive"" in creating standing to sue); Lytle & Purdue,

401 U.S. 923 (1971)."
183,37," In McCready we rejected the contention that, because there was no specific intent to harm the plaintiff, her injury was thereby 
rendered remote. This case presents a different question, but in neither case is the motive allegation of controlling importance."
183,38," See United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 610 (1972) (""Antitrust laws in general, and the Sherman Act in 
particular, are the Magna Carta of free enterprise.  They are as important to the preservation of economic freedom and our free-
enterprise system as the Bill of Rights is to the protection of our fundamental personal freedoms.  And the freedom guaranteed 
each and every business, no matter how small, is the freedom to compete -- to assert with vigor, imagination, devotion, and 
ingenuity whatever economic muscle it can muster""). "
184,39," McCready, a Blue Shield subscriber, alleged that Blue Shield and the Neuropsychiatric Society of Virginia, Inc., had unlawfully 
conspired to restrain competition in the market for psychotherapeutic services by providing insurance coverage only for 
consumers who patronized psychiatrists, not psychologists.  McCready obtained services from a psychologist and was denied 
reimbursement."
184,40," Moreover, it has not even alleged any marketwide restraint of trade. The allegedly unlawful conduct involves predatory 
behavior directed at ""certain"" parties, rather than a claim that output has been curtailed or prices enhanced throughout an entire 
competitive market."
184,41," In Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 664 (1965), the Court recognized that wages lie at the heart of the subjects of 
mandatory collective bargaining, and that ""the elimination of competition based on wages among the employers in the 
bargaining unit,"" which directly benefits the union, also has an effect on competition in the product market.  See generally Leslie, 
Principles of Labor Antitrust, 66 Va. L. Rev. 1183, 1185-1188 (1980); Winter, Collective Bargaining and Competition: The 
Application of Antitrust Standards to Union Activities, 73 Yale L. J. 14, 17-20, 28-30 (1963)."
184,42," See, e. g., Coronado Coal Co. v. Mine Workers, 268 U.S. 295, 310 (1925) (applying Sherman Act to alleged conspiracy by 
unions involved in labor dispute to restrain interstate trade in coal); Loewe v. Lawlor, 208 U.S. 274 (1908) (applying Sherman Act

184,43," See 29 U. S. C. § 52 (statutory labor exemption); Mine Workers v. Pennington, supra; Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co., 381 
U.S. 676 (1965) (nonstatutory exemption).  In this case we need not reach petitioner's contentions that the alleged activities are 
within the statutory and nonstatutory labor exemptions. "
185,44," There is a parallel between these allegations and the claim in Connell Construction Co. v. Plumbers & Steamfitters, 421 U.S. 
616 (1975). The plaintiff in that case, a general building contractor, was coerced by the defendant union into signing an 
agreement not to deal with nonunion subcontractors. Similarly, in the McCready case, the plaintiff was the direct victim of 
unlawful coercion. As the Court noted, ""McCready did not yield to Blue Shield's coercive pressure, and bore Blue Shield's 
sanction in the form of an increase in the net cost of her psychologist's services."" 457 U.S., at 483. Her status was thus 
comparable to that of a contracting or subcontracting firm that refused to yield to the defendants' coercive practices and 
therefore suffered whatever sanction that coercion imposed.  Like McCready, and like Connell Construction Co., such a firm 
could maintain an action against the defendants.  In contrast, the Union is neither a participant in the market for construction 
contracts or subcontracts nor a direct victim of the defendants' coercive practices.  We therefore need not decide whether the 
direct victim of a boycott, who suffers a type of injury unrelated to antitrust policy, may recover damages when the ultimate 
purpose of the boycott is to restrain competition in the relevant economic market."
185,45," Its brief merely echoes the Court of Appeals' description of its allegations: ""the Unions have been injured in their business, i. 
e., organizing carpentry industry employees, negotiating and policing collective bargaining agreements, and securing jobs for 
their members."" Brief for Respondents 25-26."
185,46," Because of the absence of specific allegations, we can only speculate about the specific components of the Union's claim.  If 
the Union asserts that its attempts to organize previously nonunion firms have been frustrated because nonunion firms wish to 
continue to obtain business from those subjected to coercion by the defendants, its harm stems most directly from the conduct of 
persons who are not victims of the conspiracy. See n. 14, supra.  If the Union claims that dues payments were adversely 
affected because employees had less incentive to join the Union in light of expanding nonunion job opportunities, its damage is 
more remote than the harm allegedly suffered by unionized subcontractors. The same is true if the Union contends that 
revenues from dues payments declined because its members lost jobs or wages because their unionized employers lost 
business.  That harm, moreover, is even more indirect than the already indirect injury to its members, yet a number of decisions 
have denied standing to employees with merely derivative injuries.  See, e. g., Pitchford v. PEPI, Inc., 531 F.2d 92, 97 (CA3), 
cert. denied, 426 U.S. 935 (1976); Contreras v. Grower Shipper Vegetable Assn., 484 F.2d 1346 (CA9 1973), cert. denied, 415 
U.S. 932 (1974); Reibert v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 471 F.2d 727 (CA10), cert. denied, 411 U.S. 938 (1973). But see Nichols v. 
Spencer Int'l Press, Inc., 371 F.2d 332, 334 (CA7 1967)."
185,47," Indeed, if there is substance to the Union's claim, it is difficult to understand why these direct victims of the conspiracy have 
not asserted any claim in their own right.  The Union's suggested explanations of this fact tend to shed doubt on the proposition 
that these ""victims"" were actually harmed at all. ""Many unionized firms will respond to the alleged boycott . . . by setting up double-breasted operations or shifting more of their 
resources to the non-unionized part of their operations when double-breasted operations already exist.  In this manner, 
unionized subcontractors can avoid losing any business and, as a result, these subcontractors will not 'possess the classic 
economic incentive to file suit.' Alternatively, unionized subcontractors may simply not renew the collective bargaining agreement 
when it expires."" Brief for Respondents 49 (citation omitted)."
185,48," Cf.  Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723, 739-748 (1975) (purchaser-seller limitation on actions under § 
10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934). "
186,49," We expressly noted in McCready: ""[Our] cautious approach to speculative, abstract, or impractical damages theories has no application to McCready's suit.  The 
nature of her injury is easily stated: As the result of an unlawful boycott, Blue Shield failed to pay the cost she incurred for the 
services of a psychologist.  Her damages were fixed by the plan contract and, as the Court of Appeals observed, they could be 
'ascertained to the penny.'"" 457 U.S., at 475-476, n. 11."
186,50," This interest was also identified in the legislative debates preceding the enactment of the Sherman Act. Speaking in opposition 
to a proposed amendment that might have complicated the procedures in private actions, Senator Edmunds said: ""Therefore I say as to the suggested amendment of my friend from Mississippi -- and I repeat it in all earnestness -- that if I were 
a lobbyist and wanted to entangle this business, I should provide that everybody might sue everybody else in one common suit 
and have a regular pot-pourri of the affair, as his amendment proposes, and leave it to the lawyers of the trust to have an 
interminable litigation in respect of the proper parties, whether their interests were common or diverse or how they were affected, 
and take twenty years in order to get a result as to a single one of them.  The Judiciary Committee did not think it wise to do that 
sort of thing, because we were in earnest about the business, as I know my friend is."" 21 Cong. Rec. 3148 (1890). See also id., at 3149 (remarks of Senator Morgan opposing same amendment: ""There is as much harm in trying to do too much 
as there is in not trying to do anything, and I think we have stopped at about the proper line in this bill, and I shall support it just 
as it is""). "
187,51," We pointed out in McCready, 457 U.S., at 475, n. 11: ""If there is a subordinate theme to our opinions in Hawaii and Illinois Brick, it is that HN16[
] the feasibility and consequences 
of implementing particular damages theories may, in certain limited circumstances, be considered in determining who is entitled 
to prosecute an action brought under § 4. . . .  Thus we recognized that the task of disentangling overlapping damages claims is 
not lightly to be imposed upon potential antitrust litigants, or upon the judicial system."""
187,52," Although the policy against duplicative recoveries may not apply to the other type of harm asserted in the Union's brief -- 
reduction in its ability to persuade nonunion contractors to enter into union agreements -- the remote and obviously speculative 
character of that harm is plainly sufficient to place it beyond the reach of § 4.  See n. 46, supra. "
188,1," Cf.  Radovich v. National Football League, 352 U.S. 445, 453-454 (1957) (given Congress' determination that the activities 
prohibited by the antitrust laws are ""injurious to the public"" and its creation of ""sanctions allowing private enforcement of the 
antitrust laws by an aggrieved party,"" ""this Court should not add requirements to burden the private litigant beyond what is 
specifically set forth by Congress in those laws"")."
188,2," See Karseal Corp. v. Richfield Oil Corp., 221 F.2d 358, 363 (CA9 1955) (antitrust action is basically a suit to recover ""for a

188,3," See Restatement of Torts § 279 (1934) (""If the actor's conduct is intended by him to bring about bodily harm to another which 
the actor is not privileged to inflict, it is the legal cause of any bodily harm of the type intended by him which it is a substantial 
factor in bringing about""); id., Comment c (""There are no rules which relieve the actor from liability because of the manner in 
which his conduct has resulted in the injury such as there are where the liability of a negligent actor is in question.  Therefore, 
the fact that the actor's conduct becomes effective in harm only through the intervention of new and independent forces for 
which the actor is not responsible is of no importance"") (citations omitted); id., § 280 (same rule applies to conduct intended to 
cause harm other than bodily harm); Seidel v. Greenberg, 108 N. J. Super. 248, 261-269, 260 A. 2d 863, 871-876 (1969);

discover even very remote causation""). The Court's reliance on Sutherland's treatise on damages is misplaced.  Ante, at 532-533, n. 25.  Although Sutherland stated as 
a general proposition that a defendant is not liable to a plaintiff for injuries suffered as a result of the defendant's conduct with 
respect to a third party, he distinguished cases in which ""the wrongful act is willful for that purpose,"" by which he presumably 
meant cases in which the defendant intended to injure the plaintiff.  1 J. Sutherland, Law of Damages 55 (1882) (footnote 
omitted).  In the examples given by Sutherland and cited by the Court, there is no suggestion that the defendants intended to 
inflict injury upon the plaintiffs. "

(1930). See generally Prosser, Misrepresentation and Third Persons, 19 Vand. L. Rev. 231, 240-242 (1966)."
189,5," See, e. g., W. Prosser, Law of Torts 32-33 (4th ed. 1971) (doctrine of transferred intent); id., at 67-68 (trespasser is responsible 
for unforeseeable consequences of his trespass)."
189,6," See Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 474-475 (1982) (noting that Illinois Brick and Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. 
""focused on the risk of duplicative recovery engendered by allowing every person along a chain of distribution to claim damages 
arising from a single transaction that violated the antitrust laws"")."
189,7," Significantly, the risk of duplicative recovery that the Court relied on in both Illinois Brick and Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. is not 
simply a judicially invented reason for restricting the broad scope of § 4.  Permitting two recoveries based on the very same 
injuries would be contrary to the basic statutory scheme governing damages actions, for the result would be to subject antitrust 
defendants to sextuple-damages awards rather than the treble-damages awards that Congress contemplated.  See 2 P. Areeda 
& D. Turner, Antitrust Law § 337d (1978). "
190,8," Since we have only the pleadings before us, we do not know how the plaintiff unions collect their dues.  However, plaintiffs are 
entitled to survive a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) if there is any set of facts that, if proved at 
trial, would entitle them to recover. "
201,1," The original complaint alleged five contract and three antitrust claims.  One antitrust claim was dismissed voluntarily, and the 
remaining two were dismissed for failure to state claims for relief.  The first amended complaint realleged the two antitrust claims 
previously dismissed, added three new ones, and realleged all five contract claims.  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the 
district court dismissed all the antitrust claims, with leave to amend, and thus did not rule on Kodak's alternative motion for 
summary judgment on the antitrust claims.  The same process was repeated in the second and third amended complaints, 
although the third amended complaint contained only four antitrust claims and the contract claims.After the district court 
dismissed the antitrust claims, Foremost attempted to appeal the order of dismissal without complying with the requirements of 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).  We dismissed that appeal for lack of jurisdiction.  The jurisdictional defect was cured when, after summary 
judgment on the contract claims, Foremost dismissed its last remaining contract claim, the district court entered judgment for 
Kodak, and Foremost filed a timely notice of appeal. "
202,2," The slight differences between the elements of a tying violation under section 1 of the Sherman Act and section 3 of the 
Clayton Act, see Moore v. Jas. H. Matthews & Co., 550 F.2d 1207, 1214 (9th Cir. 1977), are not relevant to this case.  The rule 
stated in the text, however, applies to section 3 only if both the tying and tied items are ""commodities."" 15 U.S.C. § 14. They are 
in this case. HN12[
] -"
202,3," Other justifications of the per se prohibition have been suggested.  See Hirsh v. Martindale-Hubbell, Inc., 674 F.2d 1343, 1348-
49 (9th Cir. 1982); Moore v. Jas H. Matthews & Co., supra, 550 F.2d at 1212-13. However, despite the fact that some 
commentators and economists have criticized the leverage justification mentioned in the text, see R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 
373 (1978), it is that theory on which the Supreme Court has consistently justified the per se tying rule from Northern Pacific to 
Fortner. While commentators may certainly assist courts in developing legal standards to implement the antitrust laws, see 
William Inglis & Sons Baking Co. v. ITT Continental Baking Co., 668 F.2d 1014, 1061-63 (9th Cir. 1981) (Wallace, J., 
dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc), as of now the Supreme Court has foreclosed our developing new theories by 
teaching that ""there is general agreement . . . that the fundamental restraint against which the tying proscription is meant to 
guard is the use of power over one product to attain power over another, or otherwise to distort freedom of trade and competition 
in the second product."" Fortner Enterprises, Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., 394 U.S. 495, 512, 22 L. Ed. 2d 495, 89 S. Ct. 
1252 (1969) (White, J., dissenting); see id. at 498-99 (majority opinion), quoting Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. United States, 
356 U.S. 1, 5-6, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545, 78 S. Ct. 514 (1958); see also United States Steel Corp. v. Fortner Enterprises, Inc., 429 U.S. 
610, 617-18 & n.8, 51 L. Ed. 2d 80, 97 S. Ct. 861 (1977). "
203,4," Under the facts alleged in the complaint, there could not as a matter of law be the sort of implicit coercion discussed in Moore 
v. Jas. H. Matthews & Co., supra, 550 F.2d at 1217, because Foremost was not forced to ""accept the tied item and forego 
possibly desirable substitutes."" Since the complaint alleges that, when the 110 system was introduced, no competing 
manufacturers produced chemicals and papers compatible with Kodacolor II film, there could have been no substitutes that 
Foremost or other photofinishing customers were foreclosed from purchasing. "
211,1," This complaint was originally filed in the Wayne County Circuit Court.  Defendant removed the action to this Court, on the 
grounds that the parties are of diverse citizenship. 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332, 1441."
211,2," The facts as stated here are largely undisputed by the parties.  They are also based in part on the deposition testimony 
submitted to the Court in this matter. See Deposition of Samir A. Danou at 67; Deposition of David Glass at 15; Deposition of 
Donald Plummer at 12. "
212,3," Quoting from United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., 362 U.S. 29, 44, 4 L. Ed. 2d 505, 80 S. Ct. 503 (1960), the Michigan court 
stated: ""When a manufacturer goes 'beyond mere announcement of his policy and the simple refusal to deal, and he employs 
other means which effect adherence to his resale prices', he has put together a combination."" 91 Mich. App. at 221, 283 N.W.2d 
at 699. "
213,4," Under United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300, 63 L. Ed. 992, 39 S. Ct. 465 (1919), HN3[
] a manufacturer may 
unilaterally enforce a price maintenance policy by announcing such a policy and refusing to deal with customers who do not 
observe it.  So long as the manufacturer acts alone, this does not constitute concerted activity and therefore does not violate § 1 
of the Sherman Act. "
214,5," Defendant has cited Harold Friedman, Inc. v. Kroger Co., supra, a case in which the Third Circuit applied Albrecht, supra, 
under circumstances very similar to those in the case at bar.  The Court in Friedman formulated a four-part test to determine 
whether concerted activity existed: (1) all members of the combination knew of the defendant's purpose to restrain trade; (2) at least two members of the 
combination benefited by the restraint of trade and, in that sense, shared a common purpose in restraining trade; (3) the 
agreement by two members of the combination actually restrained trade, as opposed to merely facilitating the restraint; and 
(4) at least two members of the combination intended to restrain trade."
214,581," F.2d at 1073. The Court's opinion is a perceptive analysis of Albrecht's concerted activity requirement; as will be discussed 
infra, the relationship between defendant and American clearly did not meet this four-part test.  Friedman cannot be considered 
an important authority in the case at bar, however.  Its four-part test has never been adopted by the Supreme Court, nor by 
many other federal courts.  While Friedman has been frequently cited by the federal courts within the Third Circuit, it has rarely 
been cited by any others. It therefore cannot be regarded as the ""leading authority in the country"" which defendant claims it to 
be.  Defendant's Brief at 3. "
215,6," See Friedman, supra, 581 F.2d at 1073-1074: It is not clear from the Albrecht opinion whether the Supreme Court would have found concerted activity under § 1 based on 
the agreement between the Herald and Milne alone if the Herald had delivered the newspapers itself and not hired Kroner.  
It would have been reasonable for the Court to have found that the Herald acted unilaterally in such a case, for in this 
hypothetical case only the Herald intended to restrain trade, only the Herald restrained trade, only the Herald stood to 
benefit from restraining trade, and no one shared with the Herald a common purpose of restraining trade.  Professor 
Areeda also finds this position reasonable and suggests that a purely collateral agreement, such as that between Milne and 
the Herald, is insufficient to constitute concerted activity . . . .  It seems to us, therefore, that Kroner's role in the combination 
was crucial to the outcome of the case. Other commentators have also criticized the Court's conclusion in Albrecht that there was a combination among the Herald, 
Milne, and Kroner.  See The Supreme Court, 1967 Term, 82 Harv.L.Rev. 63, 257-258 (1968): Both Kroner and Milne were agents hired by the corporate defendant to perform specific tasks, in which they had no 
independent interests beyond the fee they were paid.  It is difficult to find in this agency the ""contract, combination in the 
form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy"" that is required to violate section 1 of the Sherman Act . . . .  Nor does there 
appear to be any economically significant difference between the defendant's hiring Milne to solicit the customers and its 
doing the job alone. See also Handler, Reforming the Antitrust Laws, 82 Colum.L.Rev. 1287, 1299-1302 (1982): In Albrecht . . . the Court . . . extended section 1 to unilateral conduct by stretching the concept of concerted action well 
beyond the breaking point . . . .  The courts of appeals have begun to interpret Albrecht properly to apply to cases involving 
concerted action, and not to those involving the mere ""aiding and abetting"" of a supplier's unilateral refusal to deal . . . .  It is 
time for the Supreme Court to clarify Albrecht and explain that merely aiding and abetting a unilateral refusal to deal does 
not convert that unilateral conduct into a contract, combination, or conspiracy. "
216,7," HN4[
] When a motion for summary judgment is supported by affidavits or depositions, an adverse party may not rely upon mere allegations.  The adverse party must set forth facts to demonstrate that there is a genuine factual dispute.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 
56(e)."
216,8, See Deposition of Donald Plummer at 12.
216,9," See 390 U.S. at 150: Milne's purpose was undoubtedly to earn its fee, but it was aware that the aim of the solicitation campaign was to force 
petitioner to lower his price. Kroner knew that respondent was giving him the customer list as part of a program to get 
petitioner to conform to the advertised price, and he knew that he might have to return the customers if petitioner ultimately 
complied with respondent's demands."
216,10," Plaintiff has argued that defendant inexcusably neglected to raise the issue of concerted activity in its earlier motion for 
summary judgment, and that Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) mandates that this renewed motion be denied.  HN5[
] Rule 60(b), however, applies only to a ""final judgment, order, or proceeding."" The denial of a summary judgment motion is an interlocutory order, and 
the Court can modify or rescind such an order at any time prior to the entry of a final judgment.  Bon Air Hotel, Inc. v. Time, Inc., 
426 F.2d 858 (5th Cir. 1970). "
224,1," The Court refused to grant defendants' motion as to the plaintiff's first ""cause of action,"" the antitrust claims, in part because 
there was an insufficiency of discovery to form a basis for summary judgment on the contested jurisdictional issue."

to the ""Attending Medical Staff"" and granted her ""Senior Privileges in Anesthesiology."" (Konik Affidavit, para. 9, Ex. 3). "
225,3," Dr. Konik seems to maintain that she discontinued her ""affiliation with the defendant, AAP, in order to practice as an 
independent physician with Senior Privileges in Anesthesiology at defendant, [hospital]."" (Konik Affidavit, para. 28).  Dr. Konik, 
however, also hints that she resigned from AAP since ""discussions and negotiations had been undertaken [at the time of her 
departure] between the defendant, [hospital], and defendant, AAP, for purposes of entering into an exclusive contract [between 
the hospital and AAP] . . . whereby [AAP] would have the exclusive franchise for providing anesthesia services at the [hospital]."" 
(Konik Affidavit, para. 29)."
225,4," Plaintiff also contends that no proceedings in accordance with the hospital bylaws have ever been instituted regarding her 
conduct, either professionally, or, as a consequence of her withdrawal from AAP.  This contention is uncontroverted. "
226,5," Paragraph 6 of the September 29th agreement provides, ""the execution of this Memorandum of Understanding shall not be 
deemed a waiver of any cause of action of the party of the third-part [Dr. Konik] heretofore existing against any other party to this 
agreement."" Plaintiff contends that the reason AAP and the hospital refused to sign this agreement was that she intended to 
challenge the legality of this and prior ""exclusive"" agreements.  (Konik Affidavit, para. 36)."
226,6," It is not disputed that the August 31st agreement is still in effect, at least between defendants hospital and AAP.  However, it is 
the effect and scope of the contract that is at the very heart of the dispute at bar.  The agreement is provided in Appendix A, 
infra, for the reader's convenience."
226,7," Since the Court is considering material outside the pleadings, defendants' motion shall be treated solely as one for summary 
judgment. "

228,10," The above cases all involve physicians being denied staff privileges or access to defendant hospital's facilities as a result of 
alleged exclusive contractual arrangements among the named defendants.  The underlying rationale of these cases is that 
defendants' activities HN2[
] affect interstate commerce because they retard competition.  This retardation affects interstate 
commerce in the following ways: first, by denying to physicians the opportunity to compete, prices will invariably stabilize at 
some fixed rate and this will affect the amount of payments made by out of state, third-party insurers. Allowing these plaintiff-
physicians privileges and access will provide patients and third-party insurers the benefits of free and open competition.  This in 
turn will affect the amount of payments made by out of state, third-party insurers. Second, the competition that will be generated 
by permitting physicians staff privileges and access will affect the volume of out of state patients treated and the volume of the 
out of state purchases of supplies.  This point was specifically addressed in Malini v. Singleton and Associates, supra. "
229,11," In addition, Cardio-Medical also relied upon Hahn v. Oregon Physicians' Service, 508 F. Supp. 970 (D. Or. 1981) to support 
this proposition.  This Court notes that the Ninth Circuit recently overturned the district court's decision in Hahn.  Hahn v. Oregon 
Physicians' Service, 689 F.2d 840, 1982-2 Trade Cases P 64,970 (9th Cir. October 5, 1982).  Specifically, the Ninth Circuit held 
that the trial court erred when it determined the jurisdiction issue solely on the plaintiff's interstate commerce activities, since 
""jurisdiction may also be established directly by the defendants' activities."" Id."
229,12," The Spears rationale has been relied upon and followed in a number of cases.  See Wolf v. Jane Phillips Episcopal-Memorial 
Medical Center, 513 F.2d 684 (10th Cir. 1975); Riggall v. Washington County Medical Society, 249 F.2d 266 (8th Cir. 1957);

Service, 361 F. Supp. 1199 (E. D. Mich. 1973)."
229,13," Additionally, the Tenth Circuit has cast doubt on the validity of its holding in Wolf v. Jane Phillips Episcopal-Memorial Center, 
supra. ""To the extent Wolf can be read as rejecting, as a matter of law, the possibility that an interstate flow of people seeking a 
purely local service can have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, it is no longer good law in light of McLain."" Crane v. 
Intermountain Health Care, Inc., supra, 637 F.2d at 726 n.4. "
231,14," Indeed, the Second Circuit has stated that ""actual coercion by the seller that in fact forces the buyer to purchase the tied 
product is an indispensible element of a tying violation."" Unijax, Inc. v. Champion Intern, Inc., 683 F.2d 678, 685 (2d Cir. 1982); 
Yentsch v. Texaco, Inc., 630 F.2d 46, 57 (2d Cir. 1980)."
231,15," Even if plaintiff was to prove the existence of an exclusive contract, there exist many attendant problems with the tying 
arrangement theory, ""market power"" for one.  Plaintiff is quite correct in contending that it HN10[
] does not have to prove that 
the hospital totally dominated the market.  All that plaintiff must show is that the hospital possessed ""sufficient economic power 
to impose an appreciable restraint on free competition in the tied product. . . ."" Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, supra, 
356 U.S. at 11. As a first step, in demonstrating ""sufficient market power,"" plaintiff must demonstrate the relevant geographic market for the 
hospital's services.  Then it must be shown that, within that geographic market, the seller (here hospital) ""has the power . . . to 
raise prices or to require purchasers to accept burdensome terms that could not be exacted in a completely competitive market.  
In short, the question is whether the seller has some advantage not shared by his competitors in the market for the tying 
product."" United States Steel v. Fortner Enterprises, 429 U.S. 610, 620-21, 51 L. Ed. 2d 80, 97 S. Ct. 861 (1977); International 
Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. 392, 92 L. Ed. 20, 68 S. Ct. 12 (1947); IBM Corp. v. United States, 298 U.S. 131, 80 L. Ed. 
1085, 56 S. Ct. 701 (1936). "
232,," There exist many problems and pitfalls in establishing the above two factors.  First, there is a serious question whether the 
relevant market area can be sliced so small as to embrace a single hospital.  The district court in Hyde held that the relevant 
geographic area included an area of at least twenty hospitals, and therefore concluded that if both patient and surgeon are free 
to go to any one of a large number of competent institutions, the hospital does not possess the power to force the tied product 
upon consumers.  Hyde v. Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2, supra, 513 F. Supp. at 540. Other courts have accepted this 
reasoning.  See Santos v. Columbus-Cuneo-Cabrini Medical Center, 684 F.2d 1346 (7th Cir. 1982); Harron v. United Hospital 
Center, Inc., 522 F.2d 1133 (4th Cir. 1975) (per curiam), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 916, 47 L. Ed. 2d 321, 96 S. Ct. 1116 (1976). However, the Fifth Circuit in Hyde took note of several market imperfections in the health care industry.  HN11[
] ""First, the 
prevalence of third party payment of bills eliminates a patient's incentive to compare the relative cost effectiveness of competing 
hospitals.  A second market imperfection is the lack of complete information regarding the quality of medical care offered."" Hyde 
v. Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2, supra, 686 F.2d at 290. Therefore, the Court concluded, patients tend to choose 
hospitals by location rather than price or quality, which means that the geographic market area apparently may subsume only an 
individual hospital. Plaintiff here alleges that the defendant hospital is the only major facility in a tri-county service area, and moreover, it is the only 
hospital facility in Clinton County, New York.  Plaintiff further alleges that patients flock to the hospital due to its size, location, 
reputation, scope of services offered, and also due to the fact that it is the area's only referral hospital.  (Konik Affidavit, Ex. 8-
12).  If plaintiff is able to prove these allegations at trial, it is unnecessary for this Court to enter the fray concerning whether the 
relevant market area may be limited to a single hospital since the allegations here distill down to one contention that there exists 
no relevant competition among hospitals in the area.  However, even if plaintiff fails to prove the above, a relevant market area 
may still be demonstrated, this Court believes, by showing that patients tend to choose hospitals by location, rather than by price 
or quality. As for the second prong HN12[
] of demonstrating ""sufficient market power,"" that is, that within the relevant market area it must 
be shown that the hospital is able to coerce its purchasers of services into accepting ""burdensome terms [here exclusive 
contract] that could not be exacted in a completely competitive market,"" United States Steel v. Fortner Enterprises, supra, 429 
U.S. at 620-21; plaintiff must show that patients are compelled to purchase the hospital's chosen anesthesia service in return for 
the use of the hospital's operating room and analogous services.  In other words, there must be evidence proffered that patients 
requested Dr. Konik, or other anesthesiologists, and were refused.  There must have existed, then, competition between 
anesthesiologists insofar as patients are concerned.  See United States v. American Society of Anesthesiologists, Inc., 473 F. 
Supp. 147, 160 (S.D. N.Y. 1979). If this cannot be shown, the factor of impermissible coercion is missing from the tying 
arrangement equation and, consequently, plaintiff cannot prevail on this theory.  A demonstrated exclusive contract would then 
be lawful. Finally, there are two additional problems here.  First, it is conceded that HN13[
] if defendant hospital affords proof of a 
legitimate articulated medical reason for the existence of the tying arrangement, and further demonstrates that there does not 
exist a less restrictive way to accomplish the end which justifies that medical reason, defendant hospital will be insulated from 
liability.  See Carpa, Inc. v. Ward Foods, Inc., 536 F.2d 39 (5th Cir. 1976); Smith v. Northern Michigan Hospitals, Inc., 518 F. 
Supp. 644 (W.D. Mich. 1981). Here, defendant alleges that the tying arrangement provides for continuous coverage and medical 
competency.  However, at least for purposes of this motion, these contentions appear to be refuted by Dr. Konik's assertion that 
all staff physicians must guarantee medical competency and needed round-the-clock services.  (Konik Affidavit, Exs. 13, 14, 15, 
16 and 46). Second, this Court agrees with defendants that under the tying arrangement theory of liability, only the hospital may be liable.  
This is so since the AAP lacks sufficient market power in the tying product to have anticompetitive effects on the market, see, 
e.g., Times Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 97 L. Ed. 1277, 73 S. Ct. 872 (1953); IBM Corp. v. United 
States, supra, and plaintiff has not pleaded a conspiracy to engage in a tying agreement between the hospital and the group.  
(Complaint, para. 42). "
233,16," See Appendix A, infra."
233,17," HN14[
] ""Maximum and minimum price fixing may have different consequences in many situations.  But schemes to fix 
maximum prices, by substituting the perhaps erroneous judgment of a seller for the forces of the competitive market, may 
severely intrude upon the ability of buyers to compete and survive in that market."" Albrecht v. Herald Co., supra, 390 U.S. at 
152."
233,18," However, HN16[
] plaintiff may prevail on a per se price fixing theory here if it can be shown that the agreement or 
combination was ""formed for the purpose and with the effect of raising, depressing, fixing, pegging or stabilizing the price of a 
commodity (here anesthesiology services) in interstate or foreign commerce. . . ."" (emphasis added) Arizona v. Maricopa County 
Medical Society, supra, 73 L. Ed. 2d at 60 (quoting Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Seagram & Sons, 340 U.S. 211, 213, 95 L. Ed. 219, 71 
S. Ct. 259 (1951)). This is a question of fact that remains to be proved, if possible, at trial."
233,19,"  Thus, for example, the conversion factors for ""medicine"" and ""laboratory"" were $8.00 and $5.50, respectively, in 1972, and 
$10.00 and $6.50 in 1974.  The relative value schedule provides a numerical weight for each different medical service -- 
thus, an office consultation has a lesser value than a home visit.  The relative value was multiplied by the conversion factor "
234,," to determine the maximum fee.  The fee schedule has been revised periodically.  The foundation board of trustees would 
solicit advice from various medical societies about the need for change in either relative values or conversion factors in their 
respective specialties.  The board would then formulate the new fee schedule and submit it to the vote of the entire 
membership. Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society, supra, 73 L. Ed. 2d at 56."
234,20," Plaintiff alleges that AAP: establishes its price based upon units.  Two (2) distinct units are used, the first set is based upon the complexity of the 
procedure used; these units are established by the American Society of Anesthesiologists. The second set is based upon 
time: 15 minutes equals one unit.  The classes of units are added together then multiplied by a dollar value to determine the 
fee charged.  The dollar value is set by the P. C. [AAP].  This value has periodically been raised.  No member of the P.C. 
has charged anything but the fees set by this arrangement.  Any price modification is subject to unanimous agreement of all 
members of the P.C., at a board meeting.  The P.C. also sets a flat fee for O.B. services provided.  Again, no member of 
the P.C. has charged less then [sic] the fee established. In addition to the doctors at the P.C. following this fee schedule the nurse anesthestists [sic] employed at the P.C. employ 
the same schedule.  There is no differential in the dollar value assigned to units associated with a doctor at the P.C. than 
those associated with a nurse anesthestists [sic].  The fees charged by each are identical.  In addition, there is no 
competition with the P.C. for the provision of anesthesia services at the defendant, medical center. (Memorandum of Law, p.18). "
235,21," In Klor's a large appliance dealer, Broadway-Hale, used its purchasing power to induce defendants manufacturers and 
wholesalers to sell only at discriminatory prices to plaintiff, a competing appliance dealer. Since the effect of the agreement was 
to drive Klor's out of competition with Broadway-Hale, the Court found the tripartite agreement illegal per se, notwithstanding the 
fact that the manufacturers and wholesalers, not in competition with Klor's, probably had no anti-competitive motive."
235,22," See also Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U.S. 211, 95 L. Ed. 219, 71 S. Ct. 259 (1951) (liquor 
manufacturers' collective refusal to sell to price-cutting wholesalers)."
235,23," Defendants cite Oreck Corp. v. Whirlpool Corp., supra, for justification that plaintiff's group boycott theory should be analyzed 
solely under the rule of reason standard since only a ""vertical"" restraint exists here.  However, it is clear that defendants have 
misread Oreck. Oreck involved a case where a dealer's [Oreck Corporation] exclusive distributorship was cancelled by a manufacturer 
[Whirlpool].  The Second Circuit in Oreck distinguished the Supreme Court's holding in Klor's Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., "
236,," supra, in that Klor's specifically exempted from per se liability a situation where a manufacturer and its dealer agreed to an 
exclusive distributorship.  Klor's Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., supra, 359 U.S. at 212. Thus, ""the present case, involving as 
it does an alleged agreement between a single manufacturer and a single dealer, is in essence, an exclusive distributorship 
controversy [and subject to rule of reason analysis], and the 'group boycott' doctrine is, therefore, not applicable."" Oreck Corp. v. 
Whirlpool Corp., supra, 579 F.2d at 131. However, Oreck does not, as defendants contend, hold that all ""vertical"" restraint cases must be analyzed under the rule of 
reason standard.  Such a view would nullify the Klor's and Fashion Originators Guild of America, supra, holdings.  Indeed, 
plaintiff's argument here is predicated, it seems, not on the cancellation of her agreement with the hospital (a theory that would 
place plaintiff under the Oreck case), but on a situation where it is alleged the defendants combined to exclude her from a 
market or to coerce her into ratifying the hospital-AAP ""exclusive"" contract (allegations that fall under Klor's and Fashion 
Originators Guild)."
236,24," In Hecht, plaintiff attempted to acquire a professional football franchise in Washington, D.C., from the American Football 
League.  To acquire a franchise, the plaintiff had to secure a stadium for the team.  The only facility available was RFK Stadium.  
RFK Stadium was the home of the National Football League, Washington Redskins.  The Redskins held a long-term lease at 
RFK Stadium.  This lease contained a restrictive covenant which provided that no other football team could rent RFK Stadium 
during the lease term.  The owners of RFK Stadium had tentatively arranged a lease with the plaintiffs for the use of RFK 
Stadium.  However, the deal failed when the Redskins refused to waive their restrictive covenant.  The Court in Hecht stated that 
although, ""a restrictive covenant did not violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act unless it is an unreasonable restraint of trade; 
when the restrictive covenant covers an essential facility, however, all possible competition is by definition excluded and the 
restraint is thus unreasonable per se."" Hecht v. Pro-Football, Inc., supra, 570 F.2d at 993 n. 45."

237,26, Defendants contend that there exist many hospitals in the tri-county area that duplicate defendant hospital's services.
237,27," Defendant hospital, moreover, may demonstrate that an exclusive agreement may serve to improve the delivery of 
anesthesiology services and, thus, be justified under Hecht."
237,28," In United States v. Colgate, supra, the Court held that a seller has complete freedom to select his own customers absent an 
attempt to enforce retail price maintenance."
237,29," As the Court in Cernuto, Inc. v. United Cabinet Corporation, 595 F.2d 164, 168, (3rd Cir. 1979), stated: when a manufacturer acts on its own, in pursuing its own market strategy, it is seeking to compete with other 
manufacturers by imposing what may be defended as reasonable vertical restraint . . .  However, if the action of a 
manufacturer or other supplier is taken at the direction of its customer, the restraint becomes primarily horizontal in nature 
in that one customer is seeking to suppress its competition by utilizing the power of a common supplier.  Therefore, 
although the termination in such a situation is, itself, a vertical restraint, the desired impact is horizontal and on the dealer, 
not the manufacturer level. "

250,1," In teaming arrangements, often used in large military projects, two or more private contractors pool their financial and 
technological resources to work on a project they would be unable to handle alone.  See Experimental Engineering v. United 
Technologies Corp., 614 F.2d 1244, 1245 (9th Cir. 1980)."
250,2," See 498 F. Supp. at 1115. The record supports the district court's view that Northrop and McDonnell ""desperately needed each 
other if they -- jointly and severally -- were to succeed in tapping the great potential of the opportunity presented by the Navy's 
need for a new aircraft. . . ."" Id.  For instance, a McDonnell executive noted in an internal memorandum that a teaming 
agreement: was the only crap game in town, so we had to play it. . . .  The Navy wasn't going to let us propose our own airplane and win with 
it, so we had to go this way. Similarly, although both parties make extravagant claims about their respective contributions to the eventual teaming effort, it 
seems clear that neither party would have gotten far without the other. "
251,3," Both the Teaming and Basic Agreements were drafted in apparent accordance with ASPR 32 C.F.R.  § 4-117 (1981) 
(authorizing ""contractor team arrangements"").  The Government was not a party to either agreement."
251,4," The parties sharply dispute whether this clause reflects a ""license"" of technology, or is merely a new teaming arrangement 
consistent with ASPR 32 C.F.R.  § 4-117 (1981). "
252,5, The August 26th Agreement expressly provided that McDonnell's rights under the Basic Agreement were left unchanged.
252,6," The relief sought by Northrop in the first amended complaint may be summarized as follows: Count One -- injunctive relief to prevent McDonnell from misappropriating Northrop's property by breaching the Agreements. Count Two -- injunctive relief to prevent McDonnell from misappropriating Northrop's property by exceeding the ""license"" of 
technology granted under the Agreements. Count Three -- a declaration of the parties' rights under the Agreements. Count Four -- damages for fraud by McDonnell in the inducement to enter the Agreements. Count Five -- an accounting for profits earned by McDonnell as a result of its breaches of the Agreements. Count Six -- injunctive relief and damages for McDonnell's alleged attempt to monopolize the domestic and foreign markets for 
F-18's in violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act. Count Seven -- injunctive relief and damages for McDonnell's acts of unfair competition. Count Eight -- recovery in quantum meruit for contributions to the joint business relationship for which Northrop has not been 
compensated. "
253,6," a We discern no merit in McDonnell's contention that Northrop has abandoned the claims in counts 4-8 of its complaint by not 
explicitly challenging the district court's rulings that Northrop could not show injury in fact and failed to allege an unlawful 
combination.  The two rulings are found in the order drafted for the court by McDonnell, but are not mentioned in the court's 
findings or opinion.  Our review of the findings and opinion demonstrate that, notwithstanding the inconsistent language in its 
order, the court considered itself precluded from examining the injury issue by the political question and act of state doctrines. 
The application of those doctrines has been challenged on appeal. Northrop's discussion in it Opening Brief of the evidence of 
an unlawful combination suffices to preserve the claim. The conduct and relief at issue in counts 4-8 overlap and are inextricably intertwined with that in counts 1-3.We decline to seize 
upon the variance between the district court's order and its findings and opinion to effect an abandonment of claims, particularly 
given that the evidence relevant to the allegedly abandoned claims is so similar to that underlying the other claims that must be 
tried on remand in any event."

of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action shall be joined as a party in the action if (1) in his absence complete relief 
cannot be accorded among those already parties, or (2) he claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so 
situated that the disposition of the action in his absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that 
interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise 
inconsistent obligations by reason of his claimed interest. . . . (b) Determination by court Whenever Joinder not Feasible. If a person . . . cannot be made a party, the court shall determine whether in equity and good conscience the action should 
proceed among the parties before it, or should be dismissed, the absent person being thus regarded as indispensable.  The 
factors to be considered by the Court include: first, to what extent a judgment rendered in the person's absence might be 
prejudicial to him or those already parties; second, the extent to which, by protective provisions in the judgment, by the shaping 
of relief, or other measures, the prejudice can be lessened or avoided; third, whether a judgment rendered in the person's 
absence will be adequate; fourth, whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder."
256,15," Review of the district court's decision is complicated by its failure to articulate clearly the considerations underlying its 
conclusions as to each step in the Rule 19 inquiry.  For example, after reciting the factors in subsection (b)'s test for an 
indispensable party, the court observed that Northrop ""disclaims the necessity of joinder,"" a consideration pertinent to subsection 
(a).  Id. at 1117-18. The confusion that frequently accompanies joinder rulings is attributable in part to the degree to which the factors cited in Rule 
19's two subsections overlap each other.  Impairment of the absent party's ability to protect its interest (19(a)(2)(i)) is similar to 
the prejudice to the absent party consideration under subsection (b); risk of leaving a defendant exposed to inconsistent 
obligations (19(a)(2)(ii)) is similar to the prejudice to the defendant factor under (b); and whether complete relief can be accorded 
(19(a)(1)) is similar to the adequacy of relief inquiry under (b)."
256,16," Although the district court's opinion does not discuss the feasibility of joining the Government, one of its conclusions of law 
provides that ""no act of Congress would permit Northrop to bring this particular action against the United States"" (emphasis 
added).  Because the Government is not a necessarily party, we need not address Northrop's contention that the court should 
have joined the Government in a claim under 22 U.S.C.  § 2356(a)(2) (waiving sovereign immunity for disclosure of protected 
information) (see Section IIA, infra ) rather than find it indispensable. "
258,17," The most useful decision appears to be Coastal Modular Corp. v. Laminators, Inc., 635 F.2d at 1108, where the Fourth Circuit 
held that the Navy was not a necessary party to a contract action between airport contractors merely because the defendant 
""theorize[d] the possibility that the Navy would institute suit against it."""
258,18," ""Unlimited Rights"" are defined in 32 C.F.R.  § 7-104.9(a)(7) (1981) as the ""rights to use, duplicate or disclose technical data or 
computer software in whole or in part in any manner and for any purpose whatsoever, and to have or permit others to do so."""
258,19," McDonnell cannot avoid this fallacy in its argument by suggesting that the Government might ask it to modify the carrier-
suitable features of the F-18A under the ""changes clause"" of its prime contract with the Navy.  First, no such change order has 
been issued.  HN12[
] Second, the mere existence of the changes clause found in most Government military contracts does 
not permit a contractor to breach its preexisting contractual obligations to other private parties.  See Westinghouse Electric Corp. 
v. Garrett Corp., 437 F. Supp. 1301, 1338 n.53 (D.Md.1977), aff'd, 601 F.2d 155 (4th Cir. 1979). "
259,20," Northrop points out that: The impact on the government that would result from an award of declaratory or monetary relief to Northrop in this case is no 
different from that which would occur if [McDonnell], when presented with the opportunity for a federal contract, determined that 
it had insufficient capacity to perform any resulting contract unless it diverted facilities and personnel currently dedicated to the 
production of DC-9's and DC-10's for its commercial airline customers.  In such an event, [McDonnell] would be required to 
balance the value of the added federal business against the liabilities it would incur by abandoning its prior contractual 
commitments to the airlines.  And if [McDonnell] elected to pursue the later-presented federal opportunity, the airlines would be 
entitled to seek declaratory and/or monetary relief under their contract with [McDonnell].  Clearly, the United States would not be 
indispensable to such litigation.  To so hold would -- contrary to all precedent -- pervert Rule 19 by transforming it into a haven 
for sellers like [McDonnell] who, when they find it expedient or profitable, elect to disavow prior commitments by subsequently 
entering into contracts that are inconsistent with their previous contractual promises."
259,21," Any interest the Government may have in McDonnell's production efficiencies and sunk costs, if cognizable, is at most a 
disputed question of fact that was not addressed below and therefore does not justify dismissal at this juncture."
259,22," HN15[
] In reviewing a dismissal for failure to state a claim, we construe that material allegations in the complaint as being 
true.  Benson v. Arizona State Board of Dental Examiners, 673 F.2d 272, 275 n.7 (9th Cir. 1982). "
260,23," Although the record offers little evidence of a Government request for such a presentation, and Northrop vigorously disputes it, 
we assume it to be true for purposes of this issue."
260,24," McDonnell's reliance on Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280, 101 S. Ct. 2766, 69 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1981) and Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 
U.S. 57, 101 S. Ct. 2646, 69 L. Ed. 2d 478 (1981) is misplaced. In contrast to Northrop, the plaintiffs in Agee and Rostker directly 
challenged the propriety of decisions made by the President and Congress.  Agee challenged the validity of the President's 
revocation of his passport.  Rostker involved an equal protection challenge to the validity of the males only provision of the 
Military Selective Service Act. "
261,25," Although ""seemingly commercial activity"" can trigger act of state concerns, see OPEC, 649 F.2d at 1360 (alleged oil price-
fixing by cartel of foreign nations), purely commercial activity ordinarily does not require judicial forbearance under the act of 
state doctrine.  Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Cuba, 425 U.S. 682, 698, 96 S. Ct. 1854, 1863, 48 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1976). "
262,26," In a similar vein, the court noted that ""mere governmental approval or foreign governmental involvement which the defendants 
had arranged does not provide a defense"".  Id. Accord, Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 82 
S. Ct. 1404, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1962); United States v. Sisal Sales Corp., 274 U.S. 268, 47 S. Ct. 592, 71 L. Ed. 1042 (1927). "
264,27," In doing so, we note that the contract-responsibility clause at issue here differs significantly from the horizontal price-fixing 
arrangements the Supreme Court has uniformly subjected to per se condemnation.  See, e.g., Arizona v. Maricopa County 
Medical Society, 457 U.S. 332, 102 S. Ct. 2466, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48 (1982); Catalano, Inc. v. Target Sales, Inc., 446 U.S. 643, 100 
S. Ct. 1925, 64 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1980) (per curiam). "
265,28," The record indicates that almost every military aircraft marketed by an American manufacturer since World War II has, for all 
practical purposes, been available from only a single source. One obvious reason for this phenomenon is the magnitude of the 
economic and technological bases necessary to enter the military aircraft markets where a single product such as the F-18 
reflects nearly a decade of development and sells for over $15 million each."
265,29," Moreover, the agreements do not impinge upon the parties' unfettered right to develop and market aircraft suitable for any type 
of basing so long as the new aircraft are not ""of basically the same configuration"" as the team produced F-18 (see Para. 3 of the 
Basic Agreement). "
266,30," This occurred when a single contractor was unable to resolve the conflicting design demands of producing variants of a single 
aircraft for both the Air Force and Navy. "
267,31," See footnote 6 supra, and accompanying text for a more specific description of Northrop's claims."
267,32," This reading of the decision is corroborated by the absence of any direct immunity analysis or case law references in the 
opinion and by the fact that McDonnell did not explicitly argue for immunity in the lengthy memorandum it submitted in support of 
its motion for summary judgment."
267,33," In the district court's words: The concern of product and geographic market from the traditional antitrust viewpoint becomes unimportant here for one very 
basic reason.  The United States Government has the absolute and over-riding control of both the production and sales potential 
of the product that brings these parties into vitriolic conflict. What strikes the Court under such circumstances is that there is not the ""trade or commerce among the several States, or with 
foreign nations"" essential to antitrust concerns of monopolization including the critical inquiry here -- attempt to monopolize. The 
United States Government is the market concerned with production and distribution of weapons systems for governmental 
military establishments.  As such, this differs from the basic thrust of antitrust laws applicable to governmental procurement 
practices in competition with consumer enterprises buying goods generally available in the marketplace. . . .  No single group of producers has any power to expand a market share beyond that considered by the United States 
Government in the implementation of domestic defense and foreign policy which is in the best interest of its citizens. Political considerations aside, the monopoly, if any, enjoyed or threatened by MDC is a governmental creation outside the 
reaches of the Sherman Act Section 2."
267,498, F. Supp. at 1123 (footnote omitted) (emphasis in the original). 
268,34," In looking at the treatment accorded other regulated industries, we are cognizant of Professor Sullivan's warning that: It is important to recognize that there is no single conception which defines the scope of the exemption for a regulated industry.  
Although one can draw on case law from one industry for guidance as to outcome in another, there are, in a sense, as many 
sets of exemption doctrines as there are industries subject to state or federal regulation. In each industry the process of 
accommodating regulatory doctrine to antitrust doctrine is responsive to particulars such as those here referred to and, in some 
degree no doubt, to the degree of confidence which the court has in the quality of the regulatory performance by the particular 
regulatory agency. Antitrust, supra, § 239 at 743-44. "
269,35," Another factor militating against immunity is the apparent inadequacy of nonexistence of agency structures to remedy 
anticompetitive behavior in the military aircraft industry.  See Carnation Co. v. Pacific Westbound Conference, 383 U.S. 213, 
224, 86 S. Ct. 781, 787, 15 L. Ed. 2d 709 (1966), modified, 383 U.S. 213, 86 S. Ct. 781, 15 L. Ed. 2d 709 (1966); Phonotele, 664 
F.2d at 734-735. See also, Comment, supra, 69 Calif.L.Rev. at 511. "
270,36," The significance of the dangerous-probability-of-success inquiry ""has been controversial . . . within this circuit."" Hunt-Wesson 
Foods, Inc. v. Ragu Foods, Inc., 627 F.2d 919, 925 (9th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 921, 101 S. Ct. 1369, 67 L. Ed. 2d 
348 (1981)."
270,37," In the two limited aspects of the counterclaim that can arguably be construed as nonmirror images of Northrop's claims, 
McDonnell essentially sought an affirmative declaration of what the court held below. Had we affirmed the district court in regard 
to Northrop's complaint, there may have been some justification for treating those two claims as non-mirror images.  Given the 
present posture of the case, however, summary treatment of those aspects of the counterclaim is unwarranted. "
271,38," McDonnell contends that it was clearly erroneous for the district court to strike the words ""Northrop claims that"" from the 
beginning of the second sentence of McDonnell's proposed finding of fact #31.  The finding goes on to say that both parties 
intended the agreements to limit McDonnell to marketing carrier-suitable aircraft and Northrop to land-based aircraft. The district 
court denied to McDonnell's motion to reinstate the deleted phrase.  Although conceding that the phrase ""is not material to the 
[district] court's orders"", McDonnell argues that the deletion is inconsistent with other findings that the parties intended different 
interpretations of the Agreements and sought different relief based upon their respective interpretations. McDonnell's objection to the deletion is apparently aimed at protecting itself from being caught in contradictory positions in 
responding to Northrop's claims and in pressing its own counterclaims. Our disposition of this appeal renders this fear more 
illusory than real. For this and other reasons, we find no abuse of discretion. "
274,1," Because the Court grants plaintiff's motion, and remands the case to state court for further proceedings, the Court need not 
reach defendants' motion."
274,2," Thus, defendants' reliance on Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., 255 U.S. 180, 65 L. Ed. 577, 41 S. Ct. 243 (1921), is 
misplaced.  In that case, plaintiff, a shareholder in a trust company, challenged the company's proposed investment in certain 
bonds on the ground that the federal statutes authorizing issuance of the bonds were unconstitutional.  Hence, an essential 
element of plaintiff's claim was the alleged unconstitutionality of the federal statutes involved, and federal jurisdiction was proper.  
By contrast, in the instant case plaintiff's claim does not necessarily rely upon rights conferred by the Fisheries Cooperative 
Marketing Act, 15 U.S.C. § 521 et seq., or upon the unconstitutionality of that statute or upon rights conferred by any other 
federal statute."

281,1," Provider's other two policies, one an individual policy and the other a group Medicare supplement, are not at issue in this 
lawsuit. "
282,2," This motion was granted on stipulation, with Pharmacy and Provider free to renew the defense for the provider agreement if the 
Ninth Circuit later found a claim of exemption available in the aftermath of Group Life & Health Ins. Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440 
U.S. 205, 99 S. Ct. 1067, 59 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1979). Such a defense has not become available.  See Portland Retail Druggists 
Ass'n v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, 662 F.2d 641, 647 (9th Cir.1981)."
282,3," As we read the district court's earlier amended opinion, it had in fact already disposed of the tying claim in full.  The meaning of 
its amended opinion is discussed in notes 13 & 15 infra. "
283,4," The cases cited by Provider to challenge the assignment involve defects in the party bringing suit that are not present in this 
case.  In Archie v. Shell Oil Co., 110 F. Supp. 542 (E.D.La.1953), aff'd per curiam, 210 F.2d 653 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 348 U.S. 
843, 75 S. Ct. 64, 99 L. Ed. 665 (1954), the nominal plaintiff was an unpaid yardboy for an attorney who had given him a 
subsequently invalidated interest in real property via a third party.  The district court dismissed the ""strange document,"" which 
gave the nominal plaintiff the third party's power of attorney over the interest in land and, as consideration, conveyed the interest 
itself, as void under Louisiana law.  Id. at 544. California League of Indep. Ins. Producers v. Aetna Casualty & Sur. Co., 175 F. 
Supp. 857 (N.D.Cal.1959), did note in dictum that a suit brought by an association of insurance agents would have to be 
dismissed if the association were a ""mere agent for collection,"" but it added that the association could maintain the suit as an 
""assignee for collection."" Id. at 861. District Distribs., Inc. v. Heublein, Inc., 1971 Trade Cases (CCH) P. 73,695, at 90,901 
(D.D.C.1971), involved an ultra vires assignment that was also void for lack of consideration and champerty.  In Cordova v. 
Bache & Co., 1971 Trade Cases (CCH) P. 73,406, at 89,651 (S.D.N.Y.1970), the president of an association of employees in 
the securities industry was denied standing to maintain an action in his own name without an assignment from the employees.  
In the absence of similar defects, there is no need to prevent Association from bringing this lawsuit. The rule that an assignor 
can prosecute its case even if it must later account to the assignees for the proceeds is a seasoned part of Oregon law.  See 
Hibernia Sec. Co. v. United Mfg. Co., 59 P.2d 384, 388, 154 Or. 369, 379 (1936). "
285,5," Section 2(b), 15 U.S.C. § 1012(b), provides in part that HN6[
] ""no Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or 
supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance . . . unless such Act specifically 
relates to the business of insurance."" Section 3(b), 15 U.S.C. § 1013(b), adds the qualification that ""nothing contained in this 
chapter shall render the said Sherman Act inapplicable to any agreement to boycott, coerce, or intimidate, or act of boycott, 
coercion, or intimidation."""
285,6," Both nonparticipating and participating pharmacies brought the antitrust suit against Blue Shield. The headnotes to the 
Supreme Court opinion and that of the Fifth Circuit identify the plaintiffs as nonparticipating pharmacists.  440 U.S. at 205, 99 S. 
Ct. at 1070; 556 F.2d at 1375. In fact, half of the eighteen plaintiffs participated in Blue Shield's program, see Royal Drug Co. v. 
Group Life & Health Ins. Co., 415 F. Supp. 343, 347 (W.D.Tex.1976), rev'd, 556 F.2d 1375 (5th Cir.1977), aff'd, 440 U.S. 205, 99 "

correct an antitrust violation."
286,7," The insurer, Union Labor Life Insurance Company (ULL), would reimburse only charges it decided were reasonable and 
necessary, a determination in which it deferred to the committee.  Pireno had once sought review of his fees voluntarily, because 
he believed that going directly to peer review would permit him to avoid a cumbersome substantiation process.  Pireno v. New 
York State Chiropractic Ass'n, 650 F.2d 387, 389 n.2 (2d Cir.1981), aff'd sub nom.  Union Labor Life Ins. Co. v. Pireno, 458 U.S. 
119, 102 S. Ct. 3002, 73 L. Ed. 2d 647 (1982). His enthusiasm for the process waned when ULL began submitting his claims 
independently and the committee began rejecting them.  Id."
286,8," The Court left the contours of its distinction unclear.  It explained that the decision to honor a claim rested ""entirely"" with ULL.  
Pireno, 102 S. Ct. at 3010. Under this analysis, the peer review committee was only an ""aid"" in making this decision.  It did not 
affect the policyholder directly because his only concern was ""whether the claim is paid, not why it is paid."" Id. (emphasis in 
original).  But if Pireno was correct that ULL always followed the committee's decisions -- an allegation the Court was to weigh 
most favorably to Pireno when considering ULL's motion for summary judgment -- then ULL's decision ""whether"" to pay 
chiropractors would turn exclusively on the review board's actions.  The questions ""whether"" and ""why"" a claim was paid would 
both rest with the chiropractors' association.  Compare id. 102 S. Ct. at 3011 n. 8 (peer review merely ancillary to claims 
adjustment because non-binding, even when ULL acted on committee's advice). "
287,9," The Court's attempt to demonstrate that the McCarran-Ferguson Congress did not consider health service plans insurance 
policies drew a detailed response from the four dissenters.  440 U.S. at 233, 99 S. Ct. at 1084 (Brennan, J., joined by Burger, 
C.J., and Marshall & Powell, JJ.). "
288,10," HN8[
] Unless the practice amounts to a boycott, the states are free to regulate it or choose not to regulate.  They do not 
have to expressly authorize a specific activity, or proscribe it, for the exemption to apply.  Addrisi, 503 F.2d at 728. It is enough 
that a detailed overall scheme of regulation exists.  Id.; see, e.g., Freier v. New York Life Ins. Co., 679 F.2d 780, 782 (9th Cir. 
1982). Our opinion in United States v. Crocker Nat'l Corp., 656 F.2d 428 (9th Cir.1981), cert. granted sub nom BankAmerica 
Corp. v. United States, 456 U.S. 1005, 102 S. Ct. 2294, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1299 (1982), did not narrow this requirement.  Crocker 
indicated only that regulation of interlocking directorates among insurance companies would not be construed to protect 
interlocking directorates between insurance companies and banks.  We did state that the ""most obvious reason for rejecting a 
claim of immunity is the absence of any state law regulating the challenged activity."" Id. at 452. It is wrong to read this, as did the 
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in Proctor v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 218 U.S. App. D.C. 289, 675 F.2d 308, 
317 n. 17 (D.C.Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 839, 103 S. Ct. 86, 74 L. Ed. 2d 81 (1982), to require that a regulation specifically 
affect the challenged practice for it to be exempt.  Crocker only applies in the absence of any general scheme of regulation 
governing insurers' corporate interlocks with banks.  We distinguished cases where, as here, a general system of regulation 
might imply an affirmative decision to allow the behavior not specifically prohibited.  656 F.2d at 453 n. 88. Thus Crocker did not 
narrow the general language in Addrisi.  See id."
288,11," Provider claimed that these insureds could also buy prescriptions under their major medical plan.  For those making numerous 
purchases of low-priced drugs, it could be cheaper to pay 20% of drug charges and the deductible, as the major medical 
required, rather than the copay charge of one or two dollars for every purchase under the pharmacy benefit.  Association reads 
Provider's policy to prohibit those with the pharmacy benefit from getting prescription reimbursement under any other provision.  
This was a major issue throughout this litigation.  Although we find Provider's reading of its contract fully credible, we are 
unwilling to reject Association's further argument that the deductible amount was a sufficiently effective deterrent to prevent the 
major medical policy from being fully substitutable for the pharmacy benefit.  As we find no merit in Association's claims, our 
decision does not turn on the question whether the major medical provisions further weakened Association's charges that the 
pharmacy benefit created an ""effective boycott"" of its members. "
289,12," Association's argument that Provider's non-exempt involvement with Pharmacy barred it from receiving the protection of the 
exemption for its other activities is frivolous.  Were that the case, every insurer with a provider arrangement (as in Royal Drug) or 
consultative relationship with third parties (as in Pireno) would forfeit all of its exemption from the antitrust laws. The business of 
noninsurance would overwhelm the business of insurance. There is no support for this position in law or logic."
289,13," The court first granted partial summary judgment under the McCarran-Ferguson Act for Provider on the tying claim only ""for 
those violations which are based on a contract between Provider and its insureds."" It left out any claim based on the contract 
between Provider and Pharmacy. It then amended its opinion, apparently to include the full tying claim in its disposition.  See 
supra note 15.  Yet in its final opinion the court went to the merits to decide that the provider agreement was not a tying 
agreement.  As we find no support for a tying claim predicated on the provider agreement, we need not decide whether the court 
intended to dispose of it under the McCarran-Ferguson Act. "
290,14," That the product determination hinges on market demand is perhaps clearest in the trademark cases.  If consumers seek only 
the general services of the franchisees, a franchisor cannot tie its trademark to purchase of component goods used in operating 
franchises. In this ""business format"" system, consumers ""have no reason to associate with the trademark."" Baskin-Robbins, 664 
F.2d at 1353 (discussing Chicken Delight).  Because franchisees can satisfy consumer demand by using ""commonplace"" items 
and applying the franchisor's general methods, coerced purchase of supplies from the franchisor forces consumers to pay for 
component products they don't really want.  The coerced purchase of supplies thus can only have an anticompetitive motive.  Id. 
In a ""distributor"" franchise, on the other hand, consumers are drawn to the franchise because its trademark indicates the 
availability of the franchisor's quality component products.  ""The franchised outlets serve merely as conduits through which the 
trademarked goods of the franchisor flow to the ultimate consumer."" Id. To prevent the franchisor from forcing franchises to use 
only company products would prevent consumers from effecting their market choices.  The legality of the franchise arrangement 
thus turns on the court's perception of its place in consumer demand.  See generally Hamro v. Shell Oil Co., 674 F.2d 784, 787-
88 (9th Cir.1982). "
291,15," The district court first granted partial summary judgment against Association on the second (boycott) cause of action.  It also 
granted summary judgment on the third (tying) cause of action, but only for violations based on the insurance contract, not those 
resting on the agreement between Provider and Pharmacy. It amended its opinion to issue full judgment on the third cause of 
action and only partial summary judgment on the second.  Nevertheless, in its final opinion the court decided on the merits those 
portions of both the second and third causes of action that rested on the agreement between Provider and Pharmacy. Our 
decision here does not turn on the scope of the McCarran-Ferguson exemption actually granted in the district court's earlier 
opinion. "
292,16," This freedom extends to the manufacturer who for any lawful reason terminates one distributor or supplier and puts another in 
its place, even if the terminated businessman is put out of business.  See Chandler Supply Co. v. GAF Corp., 650 F.2d 983, 989 
(9th Cir.1980); Las Vegas Sun, Inc. v. Summa Corp., 610 F.2d 614, 619-20 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 447 U.S. 906, 100 S. Ct.

contracts with companies that would not deal with it on acceptable terms. "
296,1," Order Granting and Denying Motions for Summary Judgment was amended on September 3, 1982, to accelerate dissolving the

area.The comparison was that in Lowenstein the lower court had held that a state was neither a ""person"" nor a ""corporation"" 
within the meaning of the Act of Congress dealing with monopolies and trusts.  Therefore, the South Carolina law regulating the 
liquor trade was a state monopoly in those individuals; rather, they were mere instrumentalities of the state acting as and for the 
state.  As such, the monopoly was immune from antitrust prosecution as an action of the state as sovereign."

leases, licenses, and other arrangements with any person: (1) Granting the privilege of using or improving the airport or air navigation facility or any portion or facility thereof or space 
therein for commercial purposes; (2) Conferring the privilege of supplying goods, or facilities at the airport or air navigation facility; "

the airport or air navigation facility; or (4) Granting the use and occupancy on a temporary basis by license or otherwise any portion of the land under its jurisdiction 
which for the time being may not be required by the department so that it may put the area to economic use and thereby derive 
revenue therefrom. All the arrangements shall contain a clause that the land may be repossessed by the department when needed for aeronautics 
purposes upon giving the tenant temporarily occupying the same not less than thirty days' notice in writing of intention to 
repossess. Except as otherwise provided in this section, in each case mentioned in paragraphs (1), (2), (3) and (4), the department may 
establish the terms and conditions of the contract, lease, license, or other arrangement, and may fix the charges, rentals, or fees 
for the privileges, services, or things granted, conferred, or made available, for the purpose of meeting the expenditures of the 
statewide system of airports set forth in section 261-5(a), which includes expenditures for capital improvement projects approved

bond merchandise at Honolulu International Airport, in the manner provided by law.  Each such contract shall confer the right to 
operate and maintain commercial facilities within the airport for the sale of in-bond merchandise and the right to deliver to the 
airport in-bond merchandise for sale to departing foreign-bound passengers. The department shall grant such contracts pursuant to the laws of this State and may take into consideration: (1) The payments to be made on in-bond merchandise sold at Honolulu International Airport and on in-bond merchandise 
displayed or sold elsewhere in the State and delivered to the airport; (2) The ability of the applicant to comply with all federal and state rules and regulations concerning the sale and delivery of in-
bond merchandise; and (3) The reputation, experience, and financial capacity of the applicant. The department shall actively supervise the operation of the contractors to insure its effectiveness.  The department shall 
develop and implement such guidelines as it may find necessary and proper to actively supervise the operations of such 
contractors, and shall include guidelines relating to the department's review of the reasonableness of contractors' price 
schedules, quality of merchandise, merchandise assortment, operations, and service to customers. Apart from the contracts described above, during the period ending June 30, 1982, the department shall confer no right upon 
any person to offer to sell, sell, or deliver in-bond merchandise at Honolulu International Airport. (b) Under other operation.  The department may, by contract, lease, or other arrangement, upon a consideration fixed by it, grant 
to any qualified person the privilege of operating, as agent of the State or otherwise, any airport owned or controlled by the 
department; provided that no such person shall be granted any authority to operate the airport other than as a public airport or to 
enter into any contracts, leases, or other arrangements in connection with the operation of the airport which the department 
might not have undertaked under subsection (a) of this section. (c) Miscellaneous fees and charges.  The department may fix and regulate, from time to time, reasonable landing fees for aircraft 
and other reasonable charges for the use and enjoyment of the airports and the services and facilities furnished by the 
department in connection therewith, including the establishment of a statewide landing fee which may vary among different 
classes of users such as foreign carriers, air taxi operators and such other clsses as may be determined by the director of 
transportation, for the purpose of meeting the expenditures of the statewide system of airports set forth in section 261-5(a), 
which includes expenditures for capital improvement projects approved by the legislature. (d) Liens.  To enforce the payment of any charges for repairs or improvements to, or storage or care of any presonal property 
made or furnished by the department or its agent in connection with the operation of an airport or air navigation facility owned or 
operated by the department, the department shall have liens on the property, which shall be enforceable by it as provided by 
sections 507-18 to 507-22. (e) Buildings and land areas for general aviation activities; developmental rates.  The department may from time to time

However, South Carolina exercised direct control and management over the pricing and sale of all liquors.  Cf.  Rice v. Alcoholic 
Beverage Control Appeals Bd., 21 Cal. 3d 431, 579 P.2d 476 (1978) in which the prices were established by the producers with 
the state exercising no control or pointed re-examination of those prices to insure that policies of the Sherman Act are not 
unnecessarily subordinated.  21 Cal. 3d at 445, 579 P.2d at 486. While the Court indicates that the threshold question is whether 
the action violates the Sherman Act, Midcal, 445 U.S. at 102, the threshold question in that inquiry is the extent of direct control 
and supervision of the activity by the state, such as to provide Parker immunity. 445 U.S. at 103-104. It is only after a failure at 
this hurdle that the Court must continue on to examine the extent of the state's mandate and review of the activity.  Obviously if

the use of exclusive contracts by DOT and its various concessioners.  Indeed in one case the legislature experimented in 1981 
(H.B. 1470, Act 243 of the 1981 Session Laws) with specifically requiring the DOT to provide at least two duty-free in-bond 
concessions at the airport and then finding that unacceptable, not only returned the statute to the status quo, but mandated a 
sole source duty-free in-bond concession at the airport. (Act 90, S.B. 2261-82 S.D.2 of the 1982 Session Laws.) This approval of 
exclusive contracts by the legislature emphasizes the already clear mandate by the state that DOT has the power and authority

signs as an area into which access is conditioned upon the prior inspection of persons and property in accordance with the 
approved Federal Aviation Administration air carrier screening program. ""Operational area"" means any portion of a public airport, from which access by the public is prohibited by fences or appropriate 
signs, and which is not leased or demised to anyone for exclusive use and includes runways, taxiways, all ramps, cargo ramps 
and apron areas, aircraft parking and storage areas, fuel storage areas, maintenance areas, and any other area of a public 
airport used or intended to be used for landing, takeoff or surface maneuvering of aircraft or used for embarkation or debarkation 
of passengers. Notwithstanding the restriction on access by the public into operational areas, entry may be authorized for airport operational 
area related purposes with the prior permission of the director or his duly authorized representative. (c) Conformity to federal legislation and rules.  No rules, orders, or standards prescribed by the director shall be inconsistent 
with, or contrary to, any act of the Congress of the United States or any regulation promulgated or standard established pursuant 
thereto. (d) How made.  All rules having the force and effect of law, shall be adopted by the director pursuant to chapter 91. (e) Distribution.  The director shall provide for the publication and general distribution of all of its rules and procedures having

But for the sake of argument and in the hopes of exposing exactly why a Midcal analysis is unnecessary in such cases as this 
one, the court will overlook this obvious discontinuity.  Especially since at least one other judge, sitting by designation in this 
district, overlooked this relationship and failed to grant the DOT state-action immunity for a similar exclusive concession contract 
at HIA, this court wishes to spell out quite clearly this symbiosis.  Cf. Leia, Inc. v. Photo Management, Inc., Civ. No. 78-0263 
(Opinion & Order filed February 4, 1980, by Judge Stanley Weigel).  In short, the DOT is but an instrumentality created by the 
state to conduct certain specific state policies.  The DOT exists only because of the state's grant of authority and only to perform 
the specific mandates outlined in its Organic Act.  See nn. 51 & 53, infra, and accompanying text. "

have been involved in any conspiracy against Laker ""under American Law, Anti-trust or otherwise, or English law."" Transcript of

Transcript at 14."
322,11," Plaintiff had two hours notice of this application.  The injunction restrains Laker, its liquidators, and their agents from 
attempting to obtain a counterinjunction that would prevent British Airways from proceeding with the British action.  The factual 
basis for the injunction is not clear.  No one had apparently even thought of obtaining a counterinjunction, if only because 
presumably no one knew or suspected that British Airways, not having challenged the jurisdiction of this Court in this Court, 
would do so elsewhere."
322,12," After the issuance of the first British injunction on January 21, 1983, the remaining four defendants in C.A. No. 82-3362 -- 
TWA, Pan American Airways, McDonnell Douglas Corp., and McDonnell Douglas Finance Corp. -- were enjoined by a 
temporary restraining order issued by this Court from participating in the English lawsuit. Subsequently, KLM and Sabena were 
similarly made subject to a TRO.  Five days ago, on March 4, 1983, a hearing was held on plaintiff's motions for a preliminary 
injunction and for partial summary judgment with respect to the issue of forum non conveniens. Inasmuch as not all of the parties 
agreed to an extension of the TRO until such time as the Court might be able to make a decision on the preliminary injunction in 
due course, that decision was issued on March 7, 1983.  This Opinion details the reasons for the issuance of the injunction. The Court will decide the motion for partial summary judgment at a later date, and it may further supplement this Opinion at that 
time.  The Court does not envision that its decision on the summary judgment motion will be long delayed, contrary to the 
prediction made in affidavits submitted to the British court on January 25, 1983.  It is worth noting that while the airlines 
complained in the British court about an expected delay here, in their opposition to plaintiff's motion for partial summary 
judgment filed in this Court they urged a delay in the ruling on that motion."
322,13," The order contradicts statements made to Mr. Justice Parker by English counsel for Lufthansa, back in January, that the 
British injunction ""does not and has never been intended to stop the flow of proceedings in the United States."""
322,14," The British court appears to have rationalized its action on the ground that its injunctions operate only on the plaintiff, not this 
Court.  See Transcript of proceedings, February 4, 1983, pp. 5-6.  At least in this country, as the Supreme Court held over a 
century ago, HN1[
] there is no difference between addressing an injunction to the parties and addressing it to the foreign court 
itself.  Peck v. Jenness, 48 U.S. (7 How.) 612, 624-625, 12 L. Ed. 841 (1849). See also, Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinea v. 
Insurance Company of North America, 651 F.2d 877, 887 (3d Cir. 1981). Mr. Justice Parker has also stated (Transcript of "
323,," proceedings, January 27, 1983, p. 3) that the type of injunction he issued ""does not represent an interference by one court with 
the proceedings of another."" With utmost respect, this Court must differ.  It can hardly be said that an order which, for example, 
directs a party not to file further papers in this Court, as did the order of the British court of March 2, is anything other than a 
direct interference with the proceedings in this Court.  The orders secured by the defendant airlines on January 21, 1983, have a 
like effect."
323,15," Mr. Justice Parker said with regard to the Midland case (see note 10 supra) that ""the declaration [is], on its face, in very wide 
terms and appears to involve an English court deciding on American law, and in particular on American Anti-Trust law."" 
Transcript of judgment, February 4, 1983, p. 11."
323,16," By order of the British court, all the papers filed there, including the transcripts of the hearings and the court's decisions, are to 
be kept confidential, and this Court was advised of this confidentiality order by those who at various times forwarded the papers 
to it.  This Court did not seek or request these documents which came to it on an entirely unsolicited and haphazard basis.  In 
any event, HN2[
] it is the law in the United States that, except in unusual situations such as those involving well-defined 
national security matters or particular trade secrets, the public is entitled to access to what is happening in the courts, for the 
courts' business is the public's business.  See Richmond Newspapers v. Commonwealth, 448 U.S. 555, 65 L. Ed. 2d 973, 100 S. 
Ct. 2814 (1980). For that reason and in fairness to the British court, this Court wants to make it clear that, if additional materials regarding these 
proceedings may be forwarded to this Court, it will not regard itself as bound by confidentiality requirements to the extent that the 
British documents bear on the proceedings here.  Such requirements would be at odds with the public's right to know what is 
occurring in United States courts, especially in an extraordinary case such as this. It is obviously difficult for all concerned -- including the British Court and this Court -- to conduct proceedings such as these 
where the information imparted to one tribunal does not always precisely correspond to that which is made known to the other.  
If, therefore, reference needs to be made here to the proceedings in Great Britain, this Court would prefer that it be done on the 
basis of a precise record available to all, just as this Court believes that Mr. Justice Parker should be furnished with, and be 
allowed to use in every way, a transcript of all that transpires in this Court that has any relationship to the proceedings in the 
United Kingdom.  Certainly, the suggestion by the British court (Transcript of proceedings, January 27, 1983, p. 2) that an 
affidavit that was used there should not have been disclosed to this Court, if followed by both courts with respect to all 
proceedings and documents, could only aggravate an already difficult situation, fraught as it is with possible misunderstandings. This Court has given instructions that copies of all transcripts of proceedings here, all orders and decisions, and all documents 
filed with the Court which bear on the proceedings in Great Britain shall be transmitted to Mr. Justice Parker.  Of course the 
British court may make any use that it wishes of these papers, including their publication as part of an official record."
323,17," Since the British court, in accordance with custom in the United Kingdom, did not issue a written opinion, its reasoning must 
partly be discerned from its colloquies with counsel and the transcripts of its judgments, delivered orally."
323,18, The four airlines before the British court are not affected by the present injunction proceedings. 
324,19," As in many cases, HN3[
] the preliminary injunction in large part decides the merits.  Nevertheless, the parties may, if they 
wish, have their claims considered again on the basis of additional evidence."
324,20," Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Commission v. Holiday Tours, Inc., 182 U.S. App. D.C. 220, 559 F.2d 841 (D.C. Cir. 
1977); Virginia Petroleum Jobbers Assn. v. Federal Power Commission, 104 U.S. App. D.C. 106, 259 F.2d 921 (D.C. Cir. 1958)."
324,21," See, e.g., the memorandum of KLM in opposition to the motion for preliminary injunction which contends (at p. 11) that ""there 
is grave doubt"" that the American antitrust laws can be given extraterritorial effect so as to encompass ""the injury to Laker, a 
U.K. company."""
324,22," Until its insolvency, Laker was, of course, daily engaging in business in the United States, and so were and are all of the 
defendants in this action.  Defendants' business activities, including any alleged antitrust violations, had an intended effect upon 
American commerce, and hence defendants are subject to United States antitrust law. See, e.g., In re Uranium Antitrust 
Litigation, 617 F.2d 1248 (7th Cir. 1980)."
324,23, The Court's order allowed the foreign suits to proceed by their normal course in all other respects. 
325,24," Moreover, the injunction was upheld because the lawsuit involved ""the validity of a contract signed in Florida by Florida 
residents,"" 441 F.2d at 498, and which was based on fraud."
325,25," There is obviously a large difference between enforcement of a judgment and interference with an ongoing action so severe 
that a judgment could never be obtained.  American courts occasionally stay proceedings before them that are duplicative of 
proceedings pending elsewhere, but this occurs when the foreign proceeding was filed first, see Darr v. Burford, 339 U.S. 200, 
204, 94 L. Ed. 761, 70 S. Ct. 587 (1950), and when ""the expected foreign judgment would be entitled to enforcement in the 
forum."" Ehrenzweig, Conflict of Laws § 36, at 129.  Clearly Laker filed his lawsuit first in this Court, and it is entirely inappropriate 
to suggest that a court of the United States should stay or otherwise abandon a proceeding brought under the Sherman Act to 
wait to see how another nation's courts would handle the same allegations.  Ehrenzweig states that the British courts generally 
do not stay their proceedings pendente lite, because of their ""preference for their own courts."" Id., § 36, at 127.  In this case, the 
British court is being asked not simply to disregard the first-filed suit, but to ensure that its later-filed proceedings are the only 
proceedings between the parties."
325,26," Defendants also cite Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S. 654, 69 L. Ed. 2d 918, 101 S. Ct. 2972 (1981), the case upholding 
the actions of President Carter in extinguishing claims against Iran pending in United States courts and referring them to an 
international tribunal. These actions were taken as part of an executive agreement negotiated with Iran to free Americans who 
had been taken hostage there.  At issue was the power of the Executive Department, not that of a court, to decide where 
American nationals might bring suit.  The President's actions were taken, moreover, after the declaration of a national 
emergency implicating the foreign policy of the United States.  As the Supreme Court noted, its holding was a narrow one; it did 
not ""attempt to lay down . . . general 'guidelines covering other situations not involved here."" 453 U.S. at 661. It held that ""where, 
as here, the settlement of claims has been determined to be a necessary incident to the resolution of a major foreign policy 
dispute between our country and another, and where, as here, we can conclude that Congress acquiesced in the President's 
action, we are not prepared to say that the President lacks the power to settle such claims."" 453 U.S. at 688. The holding has no 
bearing on the question of when a court, acting on its own, should exercise its injunctive powers to direct a national where to 
sue, or, more accurately, where not to sue."
325,27," To be sure, a British court is governed by British law, and the defendants cite a recent British case in which injunctive 
procedures were used.  See Smith, Kline & French Laboratories Ltd. v. Bloch, 1980 S. No. 6514 (C.A. May 13, 1982).  It may be 
noted that Bloch enjoined American proceedings having to do with actions that took place in Britain, not between Britain and the 
United States or in the United States.  Moreover, the action was clearly based on a contract.  When plaintiff's American counsel "
326,," discovered that his client had previously assigned his rights under the contract, a second complaint sounding in antitrust was 
filed in the hope that an antitrust claim would survive the assignment.  In contrast, in these cases Laker alleges antitrust 
violations of a primary and significant form, and the actions would therefore not be governed by Bloch with its peculiar facts.  For 
these reasons, among others, it appears that with respect to the instant cases there may be no significant difference between 
British and American law, and it is not necessary therefore at this juncture to contemplate the outcome in the event of an 
ultimate irreconcilable conflict between the two legal systems with respect to these cases."
326,28," Mr. Justice Parker has expressed his own view that an injunction by what might be called the ""nationality"" court against 
litigation elsewhere would be a ""rare case."" Transcript of proceedings, January 27, 1983, p. 4."
326,29," This is also demonstrated by the fact that the Justice Department independently empanelled a grand jury to consider the 
questions that are raised in these lawsuits. See note 49 infra."
326,30," For that reason, there is somewhat of an Alice-in-Wonderland flavor to the arguments made by defendants both in the British 
court and in this Court.  In both places, some of the defendants proceed as if clearly and without question the British court has 
jurisdiction -- notwithstanding its own statement that interference with a suit pending elsewhere would be a rare, or exceptional 
case -- and as if this Court, somehow, were an interloper for continuing to proceed with an action that is regularly pending before 
it, without any challenge to its jurisdiction having been made and without anything out of the ordinary having occurred until some 
of the defendants suddenly secured an order from a foreign court.  See also note 41 infra."
326,31," It would be naive to expect that, were this kind of precedent to be set by the British court in these cases, other parties and 
other courts both in Great Britain and the United States would not follow suit."
326,32," Of course, companies chartered by other nations (e.g., Japan, Germany, France) do business on a similar scale in the United 
States and elsewhere."
326,33," The court has indicated its view that the Laker controversy may ""be one of the rare cases where a court in this country would 
restrain a defendant [Laker]."" Transcript of proceedings, January 27, 1983, p. 20. "
327,34," Another practical factor militating against use of the ""nationality"" rule proposed by the defendants comes readily to mind.  What 
about multinational corporations?  If such a corporation brought suit in the courts of nation X, and if its affiliates or subsidiaries 
were incorporated in counties A, B, and C, the courts of which nation would have control over the lawsuit? Under the customary 
rule, the courts of nation X decide on their own jurisdiction, both in the broadest and in the more narrower forum non conveniens 
sense.  Under the rule advocated by defendants, presumably any of the three, four, or more nations in which the corporation 
may be regarded as a national would have the authority to halt the lawsuit in nation X in its tracks.  The impracticability of the 
rule and its propensity for mischief are apparent."
327,35," Also referred to in various papers are the differences between the American and British rules respecting attorney's fees, the 
availability of jury trial, and the American treatment of antitrust defendants as jointly and severally liable."
327,36," A proposed amendment to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1) would allow a court, on its own initiative or pursuant to motion, to limit 
discovery if ""the discovery is unduly burdensome or expensive, given the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, the 
parties' available resources, and the values at stake in the litigation."" See also Dolgow v. Anderson, 53 F.R.D. 661, 664 
(E.D.N.Y. 1971) (Weinstein, J.) (""court has duty, of special significance in lengthy and complex cases . . ., to supervise and limit 
discovery to protect parties and witnesses from annoyance and excessive expense"")."
327,37," Lord Denning, Master of the Rolls, stated in Bloch, supra, that, ""As a moth is drawn to the light, so is a litigant drawn to the 
United States.  If he can only get his case into their courts, he stands to win a fortune."" Mr. Justice Parker, after noting that a 
particular exhibit ""savours of either fiction or journalism rather than legal exposition,"" added that the exhibit ""was apparently 
prepared by Laker's American attorneys."" Transcript of proceedings, February 4, 1983, p. 6."
327,38," The English solicitors were armed with lengthy affidavits from the American lawyers detailing the claimed inadequacies and 
injustices of the American system of laws. "
328,39, Britain is not involved in this service.
328,40," Additionally, defendants KLM and Sabena argue that the Court may not enter any injunction against them because they are 
owned by foreign governments.  There is, of course, a significant difference between a sovereign's public and its commercial 
activities.  In any event, this issue has not been developed either factually or legally, by adequate briefing or otherwise, and it is 
more appropriate for subsequent consideration."
328,41," That is not to say that all defendants make the identical arguments, approach the subject of the current motions with the same 
decree of sophistication, or claim for the British court the same decree of supremacy.  Some of them (e.g., Lufthansa) recognize 
the existence of several significant operative factors; others (e.g., Sabena) content themselves with ignoring the interests of 
plaintiffs under American law and the legitimate authority of the American courts, evidently in the belief that these interests and 
that authority can thereby be made to vanish."
328,42," See Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 404, 5 L. Ed. 257 (1821)."
328,43," This case contrasts with Cole v. Cunningham, 133 U.S. 107, 134, 33 L. Ed. 538, 10 S. Ct. 269 (1890), in which there was 
""[nothing] in the law or policy of [the state of the first-filed, enjoined action] opposed to the law or policy"" of the state of the 
second-filed case. "
329,44," See also, the treaty entered into between the United States and Great Britain during the tenure of President Madison which 
provides that ""generally, the merchants and traders of each nation respectively shall enjoy the most complete protection and 
security for their commerce but always subject to the laws and statutes of the two countries respectively."" 8 Stat. 228 (1815)."
329,45," E.g., the IATA meeting in Florida."
329,46," Although the defendants represent that all of them are either subject to process in Great Britain or would submit to British 
jurisdiction, this has not yet been demonstrated."
329,47," Transcript of hearing, March 4, 1983.  At the same hearing, plaintiff asserted that President Carter had hailed Laker's service 
as a breakthrough for the American consumer. Laker had 17,000 agents in this country selling tickets to American travellers."
329,48," It cannot seriously be questioned that British conspiracy laws, to the degree that they may be applicable at all, provide little, if 
any, protection from anticompetitive activities.  See slip op. at pp. 28-30 infra."
329,49," The allegations of wrongdoing by the defendant airlines are so significant that the Department of Justice has commenced a 
grand jury investigation of their activities vis-a-vis Laker.  See Aviation Daily at 311 (February 29, 1983), a citation submitted to 
the Court in the papers filed here. "
330,50," In addition to their efforts in the United Kingdom, the defendants, represented as they are by large and prestigious law firms, 
have sought to disqualify Laker's own counsel. The effect of that effort, if fully successful, would be to leave Laker 
unrepresented.  The disqualification motion, which raises serious and substantial claims, is pending and will be considered by 
the Court in due course.  Defendants have also refused to participate in any meaningful discovery, and they have requested that 
the Court excuse them from discovery until the disqualification motion is decided.  That request is being denied this date by a 
separate order.  And, as has been noted elsewhere, the defendants are seeking in various ways to defer the decisions of this 
Court while they are proceeding at a rapid pace before the court in Great Britain."
330,51," It would be a far different and less serious matter had the airlines limited their prayer for relief in the British court to a 
declaration of British antitrust law. Then the issue would become purely one of the res judicata effect to be accorded the 
judgment first obtained.  See Restatement (Second) of the Law of Judgments § 98. Similarly, were the lawsuits in this Court to result in a judgment in plaintiff's favor after trial, this Court would have no business 
interfering with the British courts' application of British law regarding treble damage awards.  See slip op. at p. 30 infra."
330,52," Obviously, if there are jurisdictional or other defects in Laker's lawsuit with respect to any, or all, defendants, this Court is 
obligated by law, and it will, enforce the defendants' rights in that and in all other respects.  Beyond that, appellate courts and 
appellate remedies are fully available to any dissatisfied party."
330,53," Some defendants focus on the American antitrust laws, others assert that the British laws provide comparable relief. "
331,54, American law would have to be proved by the roundabout method of testimony by expert witnesses.
331,55," See, e.g., United States v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 524 F. Supp. 1336, 1368 (D.D.C. 1981), citing 3 Areeda & 
Turner, Antitrust law, para. 771b, at p. 151 (1978)."
331,56," Counsel for the defendants make much of a statement made in the Midland case by Mr. Justice Parker that ""if the alleged 
conspiracy did exist and Midland was a party to it there would clearly be a cause of action in conspiracy here where Laker could 
recover full compensatory damages."" Transcript of Judgment, February 4, 1983, p. 13.  The British court makes no reference to 
any cases.  The phrasing, moreover, would seem to state a tautology: if Midland is found to have engaged in the sort of 
conspiracy that British law will penalize, then British law will penalize it.  The statement does nothing to allay the indication that 
British law, unlike American law, would not penalize the sort of conspiracy alleged by Laker."
331,57," Laker might well be entitled to an injunction to protect its American antitrust rights even in that situation, on the basis that it 
simply cannot be deprived of those rights by the kind of procedural maneuver resorted to by defendants."
331,58," It is obviously not certain that the British court will do so, particularly with respect to the American parties. However, given the 
fact that, once the British court issues an injunction of the type sought before it, it may very well be too late for Laker ever to find 
its way back to the American judicial system, less than absolute certainty concerning the British court's intentions suffices to 
support a finding of irreparable injury. "
332,59," HN8[
] The fact that another country's law may be less favorable to a plaintiff than is American law is not reason alone to 
refuse to dismiss a lawsuit on forum non conveniens grounds.  Piper Aircraft v. Reyno, 454 U.S. 235, 70 L. Ed. 2d 419, 102 S. 
Ct. 252 (1981). But when ""the remedy provided by the alternative forum is so clearly inadequate or unsatisfactory that it is no 
remedy at all, the unfavorable change in the law may be given substantial weight."" 454 U.S. at 254. See also, Industrial 
Investment Development Corp. v. Mitsui Co., 671 F.2d 876, 890-91 (5th Cir. 1982), vacated on other grounds, 460 U.S. 1007, 
103 S. Ct. 1244, 75 L. Ed. 2d 475 (1983)."
332,60," If this consequence be viewed as an undue burden on U.S. commerce, the remedy, if a remedy is needed, lies with the 
Congress."
332,61," Absent congressional action, surely a foreign corporation cannot expect that it may do business here but be entitled at the 
same time to retreat to the sanctuary of a foreign legal system as soon as its conduct of business in the United States involves 
what are claimed to be violations of United States laws.  Only diplomatic personnel have that privilege."
332,62," Defendants have argued that no weight should be given to the fact that Laker won the ""race to the courthouse."" There was no 
such race.  The Laker suit had been pending for three months before defendants brought any action in the United Kingdom. "
333,63," Several defendants have complained about the breadth of plaintiff's injunction request.  In response, plaintiff cogently argues 
that it is difficult to draft language which would relieve defendants' complaints yet would not provide them with the opportunity, 
on one basis or another, to proceed in the British court aggressively rather than defensively, as have several other airlines. See, 
for example, the request of the American defendants to ""participate"" in the British action without specifying what that 
participation would entail.  If the parties are able to agree on language, or if any party will submit language which will accomplish 
the objective of permitting the defendants to offer defenses in Great Britain without at the same time leaving them free to secure 
orders which would interfere with the litigation pending in the United States, the Court will consider modifying the terms of the 
preliminary injunction."
333,64," See Seattle Totems v. National Hockey League, 652 F.2d 852, 855 n.5 (9th Cir. 1981); 28 U.S.C. § 1651 (All Writs Act)."
333,65," It is necessary to deal separately with the British court's order to preclude plaintiff from filing motions or pleadings in this Court 
with respect to its pending action against British Airways.  Even if it be assumed arguendo, and contrary to what has been stated 
above, that a court in the United Kingdom has the power to enjoin a British subject from initiating and pursuing a legal action of 
this kind in the United States, such a court cannot, on any theory, be assumed to possess either the power to issue an order 
precluding a party to an action in this Court from routine participation in that action, or the capacity to enforce such an order 
against parties admittedly subject to this Court's in personam jurisdiction. Since Laker is not unwilling, but merely unable, to act, it may ultimately become appropriate to appoint a receiver or trustee to 
protect its interests and possibly those of American creditors pending final resolution of this controversy.  Cf. Rule 17(c), Fed. R. 
Civ. P.; 3A Moores Federal Practice para. 17.26; In re Air Crash Disaster Near Saigon, Etc., 476 F. Supp. 521 (D.D.C. 1979); 
Field v. American West African Line, Inc., 154 F.2d 652 (2d Cir. 1946). In the interim, to preserve the status quo, the Court 
expects plaintiff's counsel, as officers of this Court, with professional responsibilities, to continue to represent Laker's interests in 
the action pending here, notwithstanding the March 2 order against Laker, and to take such measures, including the filing of 
motions and oppositions, as may be necessary or appropriate to protect these interests. "
353,1," By consent of the parties, a claim for breach of contract and a counterclaim for abuse of process had been dismissed with 
prejudice prior to trial."
353,2," Michelin maintains that only one theory of § 1 liability, regarding Bostick's termination as a result of pressure on Michelin from 
complaints by competing distributors, was presented in the pleadings and at trial, so that Bostick should now be foreclosed from 
arguing that the evidence also supports finding Michelin liable for a resale price maintenance arrangement.  Although there may 
have been some imprecision below as to whether Bostick presented two separate theories or merely two types of evidence in 
support of a single theory, it is apparent from the district court's memorandum opinion that the resale price maintenance theory 
was argued by Bostick as a distinct basis for liability.  Where the evidence ""as developed provides a basis for recovery not 
covered strictly by the pleadings"", the pleadings are treated as conforming to the evidence.  Keeffe Bros. v. Teamsters Local 
Union No. 592, 562 F.2d 298, 306 and n. 11 (4 Cir. 1977); Rule 15(b), Fed. R. Civ. P. To dispel any doubt, Bostick formally 
moved to amend the pleadings at oral argument, as it is allowed to do.  See generally 6 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and 
Procedure: Civil § 1494.  We therefore consider both § 1 theories. "
354,3," A more detailed chronicle of the French tire manufacturer's expansion into the American market can be found in Donald B. Rice 
Tire Company v. Michelin Tire Corporation, 483 F. Supp. 750, 752-53 (D. Md. 1980), aff'd, 638 F.2d 15 (4 Cir.), cert. denied, 454 
U.S. 864, 70 L. Ed. 2d 164, 102 S. Ct. 324 (1981)."
354,4," These figures actually represent Bostick's purchases of Michelin tires through the end of 1974, but they are indicative of its 
sales.  By its method of operation, Bostick bought from Michelin those tires for which it had orders, rather than carrying a large 
stock.  Company president Joe Bostick estimated each figure in the $40,000 range when testifying from memory."
354,5," There was also the potential for a 5 percent calendar year bonus if sales reached a certain volume.  During the period until mid-
1977, Bostick apparently never reached the requisite volume; its allegation that a quantity bonus was earned but unpaid was in 
part the subject of one of the claims not at issue in this appeal."
354,6," Of course, for a comparable percentage markup based on the cost of the tire (i.e., approximately 7.8 percent), the other dealer 
would have charged roughly $84.00.  In addition, the discount price available to Bostick may have been better still; the evidence 
was unclear whether the additional discounts were taken from the assumed $78 net billing price, from the $100 list price, or from 
the net price to Bostick after each prior discount was figured.  The figures used here as examples reflect the most conservative 
manner of calculating the discount. "
355,7," In actual practice, much of the financial relationship between dealer and Michelin was accomplished through accounting for 
tires ""bought"" and ""sold"" on each company's books.  The record does not reflect clearly at what point cash actually flowed 
between the companies, but the practical effect on Bostick's credit with Michelin was as described here."
355,8," Michelin has argued before us that Joe Bostick's testimony was ""incredible"" given his business acumen.  While that may well 
be the case, we think, as we explain more fully below, that the issue remains one of many for resolution by the jury.  For the 
most part, moreover, Bostick's subjective feeling of intimidation is of little relevance, as there is sufficient objective evidence from 
which a jury could conclude that as a matter of fact dealership renewal was being held up until Bostick acquiesced in joining the 
National Accounts program. "
356,9," Roesch, however, holds in conflict with Battle v. Lubrizol Corp., 673 F.2d 984 (8 Cir. 1982), which was decided the same day.  
The Eighth Circuit granted rehearing in banc in both cases on May 21, 1982, and heard arguments in October 1982.  Decision is 
currently pending. "
357,10," There is no contention that a contract was entered into between Michelin and other dealers regarding Bostick in regard to this 
first theory."
357,11," When questioned about Bostick's lack of service facilities as a basis for termination when other dealers without service 
facilities were assertedly allowed to continue, Mr. Duleyrie stated that ""we took exactly the same type of action that was taken in 
the Bostick oil case"" in terminating Rice as a dealer. "
358,12," Michelin contends that to rule for Bostick we must necessarily embrace an expansive reading of Girardi v. Gates Rubber 
Company Sales Division, Inc., 325 F.2d 196 (9 Cir. 1963), and that Girardi has been sapped of precedential value by universal 
criticism.  Neither is true.  Girardi perhaps can be read quite broadly as in effect creating a presumption of combination or 
conspiracy whenever distributors' complaints are followed by a supplier's termination of the disfavored rival distributor. But we 
need not adopt such a presumption here to require submission of the case to the jury in the face of other evidence, beyond bald 
complaints, upon which a causal connection between the competitors' objections to price-cutting and the termination could be 
found.  Also, those cases cited as rejecting Girardi, see, e.g., Roesch v. Star Cooler, supra, 671 F.2d at 1172; E.J. Sweeney & 
Sons, Inc. v. Texaco, Inc., 478 F. Supp. 243, 256 (E.D. Pa. 1979), aff'd, 637 F.2d 105 (3 Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 911, 
68 L. Ed. 2d 300, 101 S. Ct. 1981 (1981), in actuality only criticize the expansive view of that case, while preserving the 
narrower point that such other evidence as we find here will be enough to raise an issue of fact regarding § 1 concerted activity.  
And the Seventh Circuit has refused to follow the stringent proof requirements set out in Sweeney, see Spray-Rite, supra, 684 
F.2d at 1238-39, while the authority of Roesch is in doubt pending the Eighth Circuit's resolution of its in banc hearing.  See 
supra note 9; Spray-Rite, supra, 684 F.2d at 1239 n.7."
358,13," Or, for that matter, for a third reason as yet undisclosed by Michelin."
358,14," Bostick does not challenge on appeal the service clause in his Dealer Sales Agreement as itself an unreasonable restraint of 
trade, as did the plaintiff in Rice.  The district court in Rice had found that defendant's evidence, in rebuttal to the plaintiff's 
evidence of a horizontal combination among rival dealers, showed that Rice had underspent on Michelin promotional activities, 
and, although maintaining ""adequate"" service facilities, had effectively shifted much of the tire service and repair work it could 
have been expected to perform on to other dealers. 483 F. Supp. at 757-59. These service and promotional deficiencies 
therefore were found to create a ""free-rider"" problem, see, e.g., GTE Sylvania, supra, 433 U.S. at 55, justifying enforcement of 
Michelin's contractual requirements, and hence the termination of Rice.  But the reasonableness of the clause did not come into 
question until a prima facie case of a horizontal combination as the impetus to the termination had first been shown. "
359,15," In Rice, the district court considered whether Michelin's actions fell within any of the three rationales discussed in GTE 
Sylvania, supra, 433 U.S. at 55-56, as justifying restrictions or policies enhancing competition among different product 
manufacturers (""interbrand"") at the expense of lessened competition among dealers of the same brand (""intrabrand""). These 
rationales were (1) inducing aggressive retailers to become dealers to enhance the manufacturer's likelihood of successful entry 
into a new market, (2) stemming the ""free rider"" effect, see supra note 13, and (3) assuming direct manufacturer oversight of 
quality and safety to lessen product liability exposure.  In affirming Rice, we noted carefully that such actual positive benefits 
must be shown before a restraint imposed by a manufacturer is accorded the deference of a ""rule of reason"" analysis.  638 F.2d 
at 16."
359,16," In addition, the program appears to be the kind of arrangement in which no single dealer can be sufficiently assured of not 
losing a competitive advantage in joining unless competing dealers also join. To this extent there is an additional element of 
""combination"" involved, see Albrecht, supra, 390 U.S. 145, one which goes ""beyond mere announcement of [the manufacturer's] 
policy and the simple refusal to deal"" allowed under the doctrine announced in Colgate, supra, 250 U.S. 300. Parke, Davis, 
supra, 362 U.S. at 44."
359,17," Because of the posture of this case we are not called upon to determine whether the potential for resale price maintenance of 
a central pricing and billing system is justified as in effect creating a new ""product"", see, e.g., B.M.I. v. C.B.S., supra, 441 U.S. 1, 
or as promoting interbrand competition through economies of scale in a manner that cannot be achieved through less restrictive 
alternatives, see e.g., GTE Sylvania, supra, 433 U.S. 36. "
360,18, See supra note 8.
360,19," Indeed, the apparent justification for Michelin acting as billing clearinghouse for its dealers is that joint efforts in this area 
benefit dealers as a whole. "
361,20," Michelin suggested at oral argument that Bostick's various ""Dr. Tire"" retail outlets provided sufficient service facilities to satisfy 
the Dealer Sales Agreement.  This may be established on remand; evidence currently in the record is at best minimal on this 
point, and certainly inconclusive."
361,21," Further supporting this conclusion is the Supreme Court's observation in GTE Sylvania, supra, 433 U.S. at 56, that many 
economists ""have argued that manufacturers have an economic interest in maintaining as much intrabrand competition as is 
consistent with the efficient distribution of their products."" Because the National Accounts program dampens intrabrand price 
competition, which is only then reinvigorated by rebating, it could follow that it was contrary to Michelin's interests standing alone 
to terminate an effective intrabrand competitor like Bostick.  The jury could thus infer that Michelin was instead responding to the 
pressures from Bostick's competitors, who had more reason to oppose strong intrabrand competition than Michelin, especially if 
it doubted Michelin's service-related justification in this case."
361,22," Bostick advanced two other Unfair Trade Practices Act-based theories which are no longer tenable in this cases.  One was 
that Michelin fraudulently induced Bostick to enter the National Accounts program, a claim identical to that dismissed with 
prejudice below by agreement of the parties.  We think that Bostick is foreclosed from reopening its fraud claim under a different 
heading here on appeal.  The other was that Michelin restricted the territory of its dealers or to whom the product could be 
transferred.  Bostick, however, failed to offer any proof of this, aside from perhaps a strained view of the potential of the National 
Accounts program as a means of overseeing dealer-customer contact.  These theories were properly dismissed. "
362,23," Dealing with a pendent state law claim, we look to state law for guidance on whether the defense is affirmative in nature.  
Freeman v. Chevron Oil Company, 517 F.2d 201, 204 (5 Cir. 1975). As Professor Day of the University of South Carolina School 
of Law has summarized the procedural status of § 39-5-40, ""Proof of an exemption is clearly an affirmative defense."" Day, The 
South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act: Sleeping Giant or Illusive Panacea?, 33 S.C.L. Rev. 479, 501 n.147 (1982)."
362,24," Strictly speaking, Rhoades addressed only the exemption provided for in § 39-5-40(a) regarding ""actions or transactions 
permitted under laws administered by any regulatory body"" of the state or the United States, and not 40(d) claimed by Michelin.  
As 40(d) apparently has not been interpreted by the South Carolina Supreme Court, the treatment of the broader exemption of 
40(a) discussed in the text gives guidance on the scope of the entire section.  It follows that if the cause of action against 
Michelin is not exempted under the broader view of actions ""permitted"" by other law, it also fails to meet the stricter demands of 
alleging acts subject to and complying with criteria set forth by the FTC, itself a regulatory body administering federal law. "
363,25," Indeed, read this way the Act truly would be redundant and, in some cases, possibly in conflict with federal law. Instead, ""the 
statutory mandate to follow federal interpretations of the FTC Act indicates that state courts 'are now free to find methods, acts 
or practices not heretofore specifically declared unlawful by the FTC or the federal courts prohibited by the [UTPA] . . . . '"" Day, 
The South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act, supra note 23, 33 S.C.L. Rev. at 482, quoting Murphy v. McNamara, 36 Conn. 
Supp. 183, 187 n.4, 416 A.2d 170, 174 n.4 (1979) (interpreting identical language in Connecticut's Unfair Trade Practices Act)."
363,26," The two paragraphs ruled inadmissible allegedly related solely to the sale of passenger tires and were ruled irrelevant 
because the alleged antitrust violations all related to the sale of truck tires. "
378,1, Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 1181 (Vernon 1963) and the Charter of the city of Houston provided for this procedure.
378,2," Gulf Coast is a limited partnership which operates solely in the cable television business.  After its unsuccessful bid for a 
franchise in the city of Houston in 1972, Gulf Coast remained in business and obtained franchises for a number of the small 
cities that lie within the Houston metropolitan area. "
379,3," Doctor Sadowski never evaluated the application submitted by Affiliated for this report.  It was submitted after the termination of 
his employment."
379,4," Shortly before the franchise ordinances were considered by City Council, the Public Service Director submitted a letter to the 
City Attorney to the effect that he lacked the information necessary to judge the merits of each application.  In relevant part, the 
letter concluded that ""while these issues may have been considered by the drafting principals, and may have been addressed 
satisfactorily by them, I have no way of knowing this."" Record on Appeal, vol. 14, at 616.  The ""drafting principals"" were later 
identified as the attorneys for certain franchise applicants. "
380,5," Defendant also argued that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine mandated judgment notwithstanding the verdict.  This contention is 
discussed in a later portion of this opinion. "
381,6," In response to defendant's motion, plaintiff cited a wealth of evidence to demonstrate a second theory of conspiracy. In its 
memorandum opinion the court set out all the evidence which it agreed would support a second theory of conspiracy to limit 
competition: By late August 1978, Clive Runnells, on behalf of Gulf Coast, had agreed with Meca that they would be friendly competitors.  
Testimony of Clive Runnells.  Al Levin, Affiliated Capital's lawyer during the franchising process, testified that by September 20, 
1978, he contacted Bill Chamberlain, an agent of Gulf Coast.  Chamberlain told him that Gulf Coast's attorney Bill Olson ""was a 
pushing force of the cable TV situation at that point."" Levin further testified that he then contacted Olson and Olson told him, ""as 
far as I am concerned, Al, it's too late; the pie has already been cut."" Olson added: ""Al, tell Billy [Goldberg] he is too late on this 
one."" ""[Olson's] words were, 'the City is locked up by five franchises. '"" On the day before this telephone conversation between 
Levin and Olson, Olson had told Jonathan Day, an attorney for Houston Cable, that Olson was ""trying to put map together"" and 
that ""most of areas are defined on eastern side."" Plaintiff's Exhibit 63. On September 28, 1978 a lawyer for Houston Cable wrote to the lawyer for Gulf Coast regarding the franchise ordinance: Enclosed is a copy of the proposed cable television ordinance marked to show deletions and additions, including some 
recommended by our FCC counsel.  Also enclosed is an unmarked copy for your convenience. The enclosed form of the proposed ordinance has been placed in our word processing equipment.  Consequently, any 
changes or additions you wish to make can be easily accommodated.  As we discussed, the enclosed form should be 
considered as an internal working draft so that we can reach an agreed proposal to present to the city. Plaintiff's Exhibit 14.  A week later he wrote another letter recounting that they had met on this franchise ordinance, and noting 
their discussions of various provisions of this proposed ordinance, including the provision with respect to the percentage of the 
City's interest in the gross revenues from the ordinances: Enclosed is a revised form of CATV ordinance with the changes we discussed at our last meeting in Section 8.G; Section 
10.B; Section 11.D; Section 12.H, J, and M; and Section 23.A. Also enclosed is a suggested revision to Section 20.A regarding the three percent of gross revenue issue in the event we 
are unsuccessful in limiting the franchise fee to regular subscriber service. If you have further comments or suggestions regarding this proposed form of ordinance, please let me know. Plaintiff's Exhibit 15.  None of the referenced sections of the proposed ordinance relates to boundaries. In October 1978, Runnells and others met with Mayor McConn.  At that meeting, Runnells was informed that McConn wanted 
Westland to have a franchise. Westland had applied for a portion of the area sought by Gulf Coast, and the Mayor indicated to 
Gulf Coast that a general area, Westbury-Meyerland, was what he wanted Westland to have.  Testimony of Clive Runnells; 
Testimony of James McConn. On November 22, 1978, notice of the November 29th City Council agenda indicated that six (6) ordinances, five of which 
ultimately were approved, would be considered. On November 27, 1978, the attorney for Houston Cable, one of the applicants 
scheduled on the upcoming agenda, sent a final proposed cable television ordinance to the City Attorney: Enclosed is a revised form of the proposed cable t.v. ordinance which includes the modifications made this week-end. In order to meet the proposed time schedule, any further revisions must be agreed by 12 noon on Tuesday, November 28.  
Final proofing of the enclosure will be completed by that time. Plaintiff's Exhibit 29.  He also sent a copy of the ordinance to Gulf Coast's attorney, who had discussed it with the lead counsel 
for Houston Cable earlier that morning: Enclosed is the proposed cable t.v. ordinance which Jonathan Day discussed with you this morning.  Also enclosed is a 
copy of the transmittal letter to the City attorney. I have marked significant changes in red in order to facilitate your review.  If you have any questions or comments, please 
let me know. Plaintiff's Exhibit 30.  The next day Houston Cable's attorney sent copies of the ordinances to the ultimately successful 
applicants.  The proposed ordinances were complete except for the names of the applicants and their proposed service area.  
Plaintiff's Exhibits 32 & 189.  The successful applicants then filled in the blanks with their names and service areas, and 
forwarded the ordinances to the City Attorney. Some applicants sent their proposed ordinances back to the Houston Cable 
Attorney who then forwarded them to the City.  Plaintiff's Exhibit 35. "
382,," The agenda for the City Council meeting of November 29, 1978 contained six (6) cable television franchises, not including 
plaintiff's, Plaintiff's Exhibit 33; those ordinances had been placed on the agenda on or before November 22, 1978, Plaintiff's 
Exhibit 174. When Affiliated attorney Levin heard of this, he contacted Assistant City Attorney Adrian Baer.  Baer relayed the 
following information to Levin: The Mayor and City Council had made their decision, and [Baer] said, ""I learned this directly from the Mayor, the franchises 
are non-exclusive, he does not know about the areas, it's still being worked out by Williams and Baer . . . . so the net result 
will be a de facto exclusive."" He [,Baer,] explained to me that there were--the decisions as to who was going to get what areas, specifically in terms of 
the actual boundaries, were still under negotiations, but the decision as to who was fait accompli. Testimony of Al Levin; Plaintiff's Exhibit 106. After an on-site inspection of Gulf Coast's Bellaire facilities, Sadowski, the consultant hired by the City of Houston, told Earle, 
Director of Public Service, and Baer, Assistant City Attorney, that he would reject Gulf Coast's application.  The next morning, 
Sadowski was fired.  One day later a messenger from Earle retrieved the notes Sadowski had made concerning the applications.  
In his notes, Sadowski had not recommended that Gulf Coast's application be rejected, in spite of his oral suggestion to that 
effect to Earle and Baer, and he testified that he would have made no substantive changes in his report after the visit to Gulf 
Coast's facilities.  He had recommended in his report, however, that Gulf Coast be given a smaller franchise area than that for 
which it had applied.  When Sadowski's notes were typed by someone in the City, that recommendation was deleted.  Moreover, 
other significant changes were reflected in the typed version of the notes Sadowski had turned over to Earle's messenger: his 
recommendations that Houston Community Cable, Houston Cable, and Columbia (Westland) be rejected were changed to 
recommendations that they should continue to be considered; and his statement that Cablecom had presented the only 
satisfactory application was omitted.  Testimony of Robert Sadowski. Prior to the plaintiff's hearing before City Council on December 12, 1978, McConn suggested to Goldberg that Affiliated seek a 
franchise in another area of the City rather than in the area sought by Gulf Coast.  McConn testified as to his motivation for the 
suggestion: ""I thought that, in trying to really help Mr. Goldberg, it was pretty obvious to me that Gulf Coast had the muscle and 
that Mr. Goldberg did not."" At the City Council hearing on plaintiff's application which was conducted on December 12, 1978, the following comments were 
made by Councilman Goyen: Mr. Goldberg, let me address Council's wisdom.  As these applications came in, they were sent to the Legal Department.  
Obviously, a number of lawyers got together and did whatever they did.  I was not privy to it nor did I want to sit in on any 
meeting. Apparently, they came up with the formula that those applicants agreed upon.  I was hoping that your situation might end 
up in the same pot as the others, whereby there would be some kind of recommendation coming before this Council, and 
this Council would not have to carve from one to give to another, which we have not had to do in the past and which I do 
not want to do now nor do I intend to. I do not want to taketh away and giveth to somebody else, because I haven't had to do that in the past.  You have a very 
competent attorney, and the other people have very competent attorneys.  What I would like to see done, and it might take 
a motion to get this done, is to send this to the Legal Department and try to work something out. Plaintiff's Exhibit 150 at 27-28.  Subsequently, the Council discussed how to proceed with plaintiff's application, and Councilman 
Mann made the following suggestions: I want to make a substitute motion that the [plaintiff's] application be referred to the Legal Department, and they in turn can 
contact these other applicants who have come forward and see if they can work out something. . . . . If you take this, fine, then see how much Gulf Coast is going to knock off this other group on farther down and then around 
and around. . . . . "
383,," Substitute motion that this application be referred to the Legal Department and Public Service, and they are to contact the 
other people that have ordinances and guarantee that these boundaries are being adjusted between them, and they report 
back to Council. Plaintiff's Exhibit 150 at 37, 39, 40. Also at that hearing, Mann indicated his knowledge of a house-count survey that had been conducted by Gulf Coast.  Plaintiff's 
Exhibit 150 at 25.  The survey resulted in a comparison between the area plaintiff was applying for and an area that was within 
Houston Cable's application, Plaintiff's Exhibit 84, and was conducted in conjunction with a proposal by Gulf Coast that if 
Houston Cable would give the identified area to Gulf Coast, then Gulf Coast would be willing to give plaintiff its area.  Testimony 
of Al Levin.  A document, prepared sometime between November 28, 1978, and December 20, 1978, by Assistant City Attorney 
Baer bears an alternative boundary description for the Gulf Coast franchise including the Houston Cable area, with Baer's 
notation: ""I-10 line shifted to Hwy. 290 without Goldberg's tract--contingency."" Plaintiff's Exhibit 56. City Council favored Gulf Coast's franchise, which subsumed the area plaintiff had applied for, and at trial several councilmen 
and Mayor McConn testified as to their reasons therefor.  McConn's concern was to keep politically influential groups content: Q You didn't want to step on anybody's political toes, did you? A Not if I could avoid it. Q You didn't want to make any type of political decision where some powerful person like Walter Mischer would be unhappy, did 
you? A Not if I could avoid it. Q And if all of the parties could work things out, then you wouldn't have to make any type of decision, other than approving their 
agreements, isn't that correct? A Yes, generally that is correct, yes, sir Q And isn't that what you wanted to happen? A That would have been beautiful, if it could have happened that way. Q But when it didn't happen and you had to make the choice between Southwest Houston and Gulf Coast, you stated that the 
other--you thought the other people were more politically powerful than Southwest, isn't that correct? A Yes, sir.  I don't know if I said that, but I'll say it now. Testimony of James McConn. Councilman Goyen testified by deposition that he would have voted for Affiliated Capital's application if ""on the 20th, Mr. 
Goldberg had come in and Mr. Runnells had come in, Mr. Mischer had come in, and all the principals had come in, and a piece 
of Houston had been carved out for Mr. Goldberg with no objection by anybody."" Councilman Robinson testified that he would 
have supported Affiliated Capital's application if plaintiff had been able to work something out with Gulf Coast to give him what 
he wanted. Councilman Westmoreland testified that he did not disagree with his prior deposition testimony that Affiliated had 
been unable to work out any type of arrangement with Gulf Coast, and for that reason Westmoreland voted in favor of Gulf 
Coast. Finally, plaintiff's expert witness, Martin Malarkey, testified at length about the detrimental results of the noncompetitive 
franchising process in Houston, and about the benefits to residents of other cities where the process has involved competition on 
the merits of the applications.  According to his testimony, the benefits include lower rates, provisions for sanctions in the event 
of noncompliance by the franchisee, provisions for performance bonds, and provisions requiring city approval prior to changes in 
ownership or control of the franchises. Further, he testified that normally the city itself prepares the franchise ordinance, rather 
than allowing applicants to do so."

] The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby 
promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition.  To determine that question the 
court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and 
after the restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable.  The history of the restraint, the 
evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all "

390,1," As an aside, and because the majority's holding required that it address the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, I would briefly point out 
that the district court's analysis of this issue (the only analysis on which the majority relies) necessarily depends on a fact 
determination that the city and mayor participated in a conspiracy to unreasonably restrain trade by requiring defendants to 
agree on territorial boundaries. In adopting this reasoning, the majority overlooks the same basic premise missed by the district 
court.  This judicial fact-finding is antithetical to the district court's determination that adequate proof supported the jury's finding 
to the contrary.  That the decision-makers may have been members of a later conspiracy to refuse to change boundary lines 
does not affect their administrative position vis-a-vis the initial agreement. "
394,1," Unless otherwise indicated, references to ""attorneys general"" will include the Corporation Counsel of the District of Columbia, 
who for all relevant purposes is classified under the statutory scheme as a state attorney general.  See 15 U.S.C. § 15 (g).  
Similarly, references to ""states"" will include the District of Columbia."
394,2," In addition, each state seeks injunctive relief under 15 U.S.C. § 26, Pennsylvania alleges a tie-in violation under 15 U.S.C. §§ 1 
& 14, and Maryland and Delaware assert pendent claims under their state antitrust statutes."
394,3," On appeal, defendants challenge the authority of only four of the six attorneys general involved in this consolidated litigation.  
No challenge was made to the authority of the West Virginia Attorney General to bring a parens patriae action, apparently 
because the West Virginia legislature has vested the attorney general with explicit power to sue under the federal antitrust laws, 
see W. Va. Code § 47-18-17(a) (1980).  Furthermore, no challenge is raised here to the parens patriae authority of the Virginia 
Attorney General; the Virginia case was not transferred to the District of Maryland until after the district court issued an 
appropriate certification under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b)."
394,4," HN2[
] ""The term 'State attorney general' means the chief legal officer of a State, or any other person authorized by State law to bring actions under section 15c. . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 15g(1). "
395,5," Though the new procedural right does involve a remedial expansion in the form of a ""civil penalty"" recoverable by the state 
itself.  See 15 U.S.C. § 15e(2)."
395,6," The state attorney general thus might be viewed as suing on the state's cause of action ex relatione, in a ""legal proceeding . . . 
instituted by the attorney general . . . in the name and behalf of the state, but on the information and at the instigation of an 
individual."" Black's Law Dictionary 522-23 (5th ed. 1979).  Although obviously not dispositive, we note that each of the 
consolidated actions at issue here has been styled as ""State"" ex rel. ""Attorney General."""
395,7," The plaintiff-attorneys general here involved, like those in a vast majority of jurisdictions, possess common law powers and 
duties in addition to those defined expressly by statutory or constitutional provision.  See Commonwealth v. Schab, 477 Pa. 55, 
383 A.2d 819 (1978) (Pennsylvania); Murphy v. Yates, 276 Md. 475, 348 A.2d 837 (1975) (Maryland); Darling Apartment Co. v. 
Springer, 25 Del. Ch. 420, 22 A.2d 397 (Del. Ch. 1941) (Delaware); cf.  Mead v. Phillips, 77 U.S. App. D.C. 365, 135 F.2d 819, "
396,824," (D.C. Cir. 1943) (common law an important and substantial part of the law of the District of Columbia).  See generally 
Shepperd, Common Law Powers and Duties of the Attorney General, 7 Baylor L. Rev. 1, 1-3 (1955). None of the four 
jurisdictions involved in this appeal explicitly forbids its attorney general to maintain these actions, and ""in the absence of 
express statutory or constitutional restrictions, the common law duties and powers attach themselves to the office as far as they 
are applicable and in harmony with our system of government."" State ex rel. Derryberry v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 516 P.2d 813, 
818-19 (Okl. 1974) (citing cases); see also D'Amico v. Board of Medical Examiners, 11 Cal. 3d 1, 112 Cal. Rptr. 786, 520 P.2d 
10, 20 (1974); Lund ex rel. Wilbur v. Pratt, 308 A.2d 554, 558 (Me. 1973)."
396,8," We agree that the statutory right of action is more expansive.  In strict contemplation, common law parens patriae actions only 
involved the state in two capacities: as ""the general guardian of all infants, idiots, and lunatics"" and supervisor of ""all charitable 
uses in the kingdom,"" 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *47; and as the watchdog of its ""quasi-sovereign"" interests.  See Hawaii 
v. Standard Oil Co., 405 U.S. 251, 257-58, 31 L. Ed. 2d 184, 92 S. Ct. 885 (1972); West Virginia v. Chas. Pfizer & Co., 440 F.2d 
1079, 1089 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 871, 92 S. Ct. 81, 30 L. Ed. 2d 115 (1971). See generally Curtis, The Checkered 
Career of Parens Patriae: The State as Parent or Tyrant, 25 DePaul L. Rev. 895 (1976). Neither capacity embraces actions such 
as those here in issue where the state sues on behalf of injured natural residents. The putatively injured consumers do not suffer 
from any legal disability; indeed, the statute presumes in them existing individual rights of action, see Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 
431 U.S. 720, 734 n.14, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707, 97 S. Ct. 2061 (1977). Furthermore, ""no state has a legitimate quasi-sovereign 
interest in seeing that consumers or any other group of persons receive a given sum of money."" Malina & Blechman, Parens 
Patriae Suits for Treble Damages Under the Antitrust Laws, 65 Nw. L. Rev. 193, 214 (1970). In Justice Holmes' classic 
formulation, there cannot be a state quasi-sovereign interest ""independent of and behind the titles of its citizens,"" Georgia v. 
Tennessee Copper Co., 206 U.S. 230, 237, 51 L. Ed. 1038, 27 S. Ct. 618 (1907), when by definition the statute empowers the 
state to enforce the rights of injured citizens.  See Pfizer, Inc. v. Lord, 522 F.2d 612, 616-18 (8th Cir. 1975), cert. denied sub 
nom.  Imperial Government of Iran v. Pfizer, Inc., 424 U.S. 950, 96 S. Ct. 1422, 47 L. Ed. 2d 356 (1976); California v. Frito-
Lay, Inc., 474 F.2d 774, 775-77 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 908, 36 L. Ed. 2d 974, 93 S. Ct. 2291 (1973); Philadelphia 
Housing Authority v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Corp., 309 F. Supp. 1057, 1062-63 (E.D. Pa. 1969); Land O'Lakes 
Creameries, Inc. v. Louisiana State Board of Health, 160 F. Supp. 387, 388-89 (E.D. La. 1958). But, as our discussion in text indicates, the fact that the statutory ""parens patriae"" action is broader in scope than the common 
law action is not dispositive of the issue raised by defendants."
396,9," It is important to distinguish Congress' assumed lack of power (or intention) to expand the authority of state attorneys general 
from its obvious power to create a right of action which would be available to a state attorney general acting fully within the 
scope of predefined powers.  On oral argument, counsel for defendants blurred this distinction by urging that Congress had 
necessarily expanded the powers of state attorneys general because a ""parens patriae"" action seeking damages on behalf of 
individual consumers could not have been maintained prior to passage of the Antitrust Improvements Act. See California v. Frito-
Lay, Inc., 474 F.2d 774 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 908, 36 L. Ed. 2d 974, 93 S. Ct. 2291 (1973). But it is entirely possible 
that a state attorney general could be acting within the limits of state-defined power while prosecuting a new federal right of 
action. "
397,10," HN8[
] The Maryland Constitution requires as well that either the General Assembly or the Governor authorize the Attorney General to prosecute an action on the part of the State.  See Md. Const. art. V, § 3(a)(2).  As the parties concede, the Maryland 
Attorney General has received authorization from the Governor to maintain this cause of action."
397,11," Our resolution avoids a substantial separation-of-powers question that would be presented by a judicial determination that a 
state attorney general has exceeded the broad scope of legislatively and constitutionally delegated authority.  Cf.  Nader v. 
Kleindienst, 375 F. Supp. 1138, 1141-42 (D.D.C. 1973) (discussing separation-of-powers issue presented by judicial review of 
prosecutor's discretion to refuse to prosecute); Secretary of Administration v. Attorney General, 367 Mass. 154, 326 N.E.2d 334, 
339 (1975) (suggesting that recourse to the political arena must serve as the ultimate check on the powers of a state attorney 
general)."
397,12," We do not mean to suggest, as the district court seemingly did, that any action brought by the attorney general and captioned 
in the name of the state ipso facto falls within the scope of an attorney general's functions.  Here, however, we do not rely on the 
styling of the complaint, but look rather to whether there exists an underlying federal right of action in the name of the state. "
398,13," A state may well have a ""public interest"" in maintaining an action without having a ""quasi-sovereign"" interest sufficient to 
support original jurisdiction in the Supreme Court or to overcome an eleventh amendment bar to the recovery of damages.  Cf.  
Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 102 S. Ct. 3260, 3271, 73 L. Ed. 2d 995 (1982) 
(Brennan, J., concurring) (""the question whether a State can bring a parens patriae action within the original jurisdiction of this 
Court may well turn on considerations quite different from those implicated where the State seeks to press a parens patriae 
claim in the district courts"").  HN10[
] The question of whether a state possesses a ""quasi-sovereign"" interest in an action, 
vitally important in challenges to a state's standing to sue under the antitrust laws, see, e.g., Alfred L. Snapp & Son, or suits 
seeking to invoke the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, see, e.g., Georgia v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 324 U.S. 439, 
89 L. Ed. 1051, 65 S. Ct. 716 (1945); Oklahoma v. Atchison, Topeka, & Santa Fe Railway Co., 220 U.S. 277, 55 L. Ed. 465, 31 
S. Ct. 434 (1911); New Hampshire v. Louisiana, 108 U.S. 76, 27 L. Ed. 656, 2 S. Ct. 176 (1883), does not bear on the separate 
question whether a state has an interest in ""present[ing] and enforc[ing] individual claims of its citizens as their trustee."" North 
Dakota v. Minnesota, 263 U.S. 365, 376, 68 L. Ed. 342, 44 S. Ct. 138 (1923). This distinction was recognized in Oklahoma ex rel. Johnson v. Cook, 304 U.S. 387, 82 L. Ed. 1416, 58 S. Ct. 954 (1938), where 
the Supreme Court held that Oklahoma could not invoke the Court's original jurisdiction in an action brought by the state seeking 
to liquidate the assets of an insolvent bank and repay depositors and creditors.  At the same time, however, the Court observed 
that ""the protection of depositors of insolvent state banks is a distinct economic policy of the state"" and that ""in so far as the 
object of th[e] action is to further the established economic policy of the state, the state may be said to have a real interest 
created by its governmental policy, as distinguished from a mere nominal interest, even though the pecuniary benefits of the 
litigation, if ultimately successful, go to the depositors and creditors of the insolvent bank."" Id. at 391, 58 S. Ct. at 956 (quoting 
State ex rel. Murray v. Pure Oil Co., 169 Okla. 507, 510, 37 P.2d 608, 610 (1934))."
398,14," In this circumstance, where the state seeks recovery of damages on behalf of specific individuals injured by antitrust 
violations, it is concededly not acting in its ""quasi-sovereign"" capacity.  See supra note 8.  But see Massachusetts ex rel. Bellotti 
v. Russell Stover Candies, Inc., 541 F. Supp. 143, 145 (D. Mass. 1982)."
398,15," Furthermore, many cases have recognized vast discretion in state attorneys general to determine the scope of the public 
interest, to be disturbed only where the action is ""clearly inimical to the people's interest."" Michigan State Chiropractic 
Association v. Kelley, 79 Mich. App. 789, 262 N.W.2d 676, 677 (Mich. Ct. App. 1978). See, e.g., Florida ex rel. Shevin v. Exxon 
Corp., 526 F.2d 266, 268-69 (5th Cir.) (citing cases), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 829, 97 S. Ct. 88, 50 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1976); Hyland v.

403,1," Smith v. Northern Michigan Hospitals, Inc., 518 F. Supp. 644 (W.D. Mich. 1981)."
403,2," The five plaintiff physicians will be referred to, for convenience, interchangeably as either ""plaintiffs"" or ""appellants."""
403,3," All claims against defendant Northern Michigan Hospitals must be dismissed under our disposition of this case.  See text, infra, 
at p. 26."
403,4," One major impetus for this merger was the desire of Little Traverse to expand its facilities.  To do so required the approval of 
the regional Health Systems Agency and the Michigan Department of Public Health. Lockwood-MacDonald at the same time had 
excess capacity.  The Michigan Department of Public Health approved a scaled down version of Little Traverse expansion 
conditioned on the merger taking place."
403,5," Three of the five plaintiff physicians left the Petoskey area subsequent to the merger of the two former hospitals.  Dr. DePuydt 
left Petoskey on June 1, 1979, and Dr. Foster moved to Indiana in August of that same year.  Dr. Taylor moved his practice to 
Cheboygan, Michigan on October 17, 1977, prior to any of the allegedly anti-competitive acts now complained of had occurred.  
His claims must be dismissed on this basis alone. "
404,6," The appellants' theories for recovery have shifted as the case has developed through almost two years of discovery.  Initially, 
the appellants challenged both the merger and the consolidation of emergency rooms.  These claims were dropped prior to the 
District Court's grant of summary judgment."
404,7," Prior to the merger the emergency room at Lockwood-MacDonald was staffed by various independent physicians including 
appellants on a rotating part-time basis.  The emergency room at Little Traverse was staffed by Burns Clinic under an exclusive 
contract."
404,8," The cost differential between the only two competitors, Burns and the Williams Group, was apparently minimal.  NMH awarded 
the contract to the Burns Clinic on the basis of prior favorable experience with the Burns emergency room physicians and a 
strong NMH staff preference for ""in house"" staffing. ."
404,9," Although the rule does not require treatment by a Burns Clinic pediatrician, that is, in fact, its practical effect.  The record 
reveals that an independent pediatrician has investigated setting up practice in Petoskey but has not done so.  He was offered 
staff privileges but Burns Clinic pediatricians were unwilling to cover for him on weekends or emergencies."
404,10," The hospital also requires mandatory consultations with a pediatrician for all patients who are admitted with certain medical 
problems, e.g., Cesarean section and neonatal care infants require an attending physician.  The appellants vaguely complain of 
these rules but fail to specify how such manifestly reasonable medical practice requirements imposed by the hospital are in any 
way violative of the antitrust laws. Such rules, therefore, play no part in our disposition of the appellants' claims. "
406,11," The Seventh Circuit in Weit v. Continental Ill. National Bank & Trust Co., 641 F.2d 457, 464 (7th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 455 
U.S. 988, 71 L. Ed. 2d 847, 102 S. Ct. 1610 (1982) suggests that the distinction between summary judgment in antitrust litigation 
versus other civil matters is no longer viable.  However, this Circuit, as well as others, has reaffirmed the distinction as 
recognized in Poller and clarified in First National Bank.  E.g., David-Watkins Co. v. Service Merchandise, 686 F.2d 1190, 1197 
(6th Cir. 1982); Taylor Drug Stores v. Assoc. Dry Goods, 560 F.2d 211, 213 (6th Cir. 1977); National Electrical Contractors

510 F.2d 52, 55 (9th Cir. 1975) (expressing reluctance to grant summary judgment in antitrust litigation but nonetheless requiring 
that the plaintiff come forward with specific factual support upon which the requisite inference of conspiracy may be drawn once 
the defendant rebuts plaintiff's allegations with probative evidence).  Proctor v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., 218 U.S. App. 
D.C. 289, 675 F.2d 308, 335 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (the amount of discovery taken weighs against traditional reluctance to grant 
summary disposition). "
407,12," The medical profession is, of course, not exempt from application of the antitrust laws. E.g., Arizona v. Maricopa County 
Medical Society, 457 U.S. 332, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48, 102 S. Ct. 2466, 2475-76 (1982). See also National Society of Professional 
Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1978); Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 
44 L. Ed. 2d 572, 95 S. Ct. 2004 (1977). Nevertheless, some professional practices might survive antitrust scrutiny under the 
rule of reason even though illegal in other contexts.  Maricopa County, 457 U.S. at 349, 102 S. Ct. at 2475, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48; 
National Society of Professional Engineers, 435 U.S. at 686, 696; Goldfarb, 421 U.S. at 788-89 n.17. The Supreme Court has not delineated exactly when or how the special circumstances relevant to learned professions should 
properly affect application of the antitrust laws. In National Society of Professional Engineers, the Court reasserted the basic 
principle that the focus of inquiry in any antitrust analysis is confined to consideration of ""the challenged restraint's impact on 
competitive conditions."" 435 U.S. at 688. In response to the defendant engineer's professional ethics and public safety 
justifications for their restraint on competitive bidding the Court emphasized that ""the purpose of the analysis is to form a 
judgment about the competitive significance of the restraint; it is not to decide whether a policy favoring competition is in the 
public interest, or in the interest of the members of an industry.  Subject to exceptions defined by statute, that policy decision has 
been made by Congress."" Id. at 692. See National Gerimedical Hospital v. Blue Cross, 452 U.S. 378, 393 n.19, 69 L. Ed. 2d 89, 
101 S. Ct. 2415 (1981); Academy of Clinical Psychologists v. Blue Shield of Va., 624 F.2d 476, 485-86 (4th Cir. 1980), cert. 
denied 450 U.S. 916, 67 L. Ed. 2d 342, 101 S. Ct. 1360 (1981). The Court thereby ""intimated"" that the professions may adopt 
ethical rules which regulate and promote competition in a manner appropriate to the profession but may not create rules which 
have an ""overall anti-competitive effect."" Id. at 686, 696 n. 22. See id. at 699 (Blackmun, J. concurring).  Despite this language 
the Court has apparently not entirely foreclosed consideration of benefits other than enhanced competition -- such as quality of 
service, or protection from malpractice claims -- when applying the rule of reason to the professions. See Maricopa County, 457 
U.S. at 349, 102 S.Ct at 2475. In the present case, since there is no evidence to support an inference of the required concerted action, it is not necessary to 
consider what effect, if any, the defendants' potential medical justifications would have on a rule of reason analysis."
407,13, The results of these audits found that only a small number of errors had actually been made. 
408,14," Although often referred to as the ""intra-enterprise"" theory of conspiracy, the exception at issue in this case is distinct from 
those cases in which conspiracy is alleged to exist among the vertically related corporate subsidiaries of a defendant parent 
corporation.  See, e.g., Perma Life Mufflers v. International Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 141-42, 20 L. Ed. 2d 982, 88 S. Ct. 1981 
(1968); Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, 340 U.S. 211, 215, 95 L. Ed. 219, 71 S. Ct. 259 (1951). Here the 
conspiracy is supposed to exist between a single, professional corporation and its member physicians."
408,15," There are rather substantial policy reasons for not adopting such an exception.  See Note, ""Conspiring Entities"" Under Section 
1 of the Sherman Act, 95 Harv. L.Rev. 661 (1981-82) (summarizing the policy aspects of the intra-enterprise doctrine of 
corporation conspiracies)."
408,16," The present case should be distinguished from the Nurse Midwifery and Delta Dental Plan cases cited by the appellants.  In 
those cases the corporations involved were incorporated associations of independent physician members created to provide 
health care insurance programs.  These corporate entities served purposes other than the actual physical delivery of health care 
services by member physicians.  Each participating physician in the incorporated association maintained the actual practice of 
their profession independent of that corporate body.  Under these circumstances, the independent personal stake of either 
member is readily apparent.  Compare Virginia Academy, 624 F.2d at 479 (finding that ""Blue Shield"" of Virginia was an agent 
under the direction and control of its member physicians and not a single entity for antitrust purposes). In contrast, the Burns 
Clinic in the present case was organized by member physicians to facilitate delivery of specialized medical services in a group 
practice.  The interest of each clinic physician is one and the same as the enterprise they form a part of. "
409,17," The present case is in this sense clearly distinguishable from the Greenfield Publishing cases.  There, the individual employee 
held capable of conspiring with his corporation had both an independent personal stake in achieving the conspiracy's object and 
the power to himself institute the anti-competitive policy for his corporation.  However, even were this distinguishing feature 
absent, it is doubtful that we would follow the analysis in that case.  Compare with America's Best Cinema Corp. v. Fort Wayne 
Newspapers, Inc., 347 F. Supp. 328 (N.D. Ind. 1972)."
409,18, See Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 450.226 (West 1967).
409,19," That such corporations are often organized primarily for tax and pension purposes does not warrant disregarding their 
corporate structure under Michigan state law.  See Kline v. Kline, 104 Mich. App. 700, 305 N.W.2d 297 (1981)."
409,20," E. Kintner, Federal Antitrust Law, Vol. II, § 9.8, pp. 22-23 (1980), discusses and agrees with this proposition."
409,21," The Little Traverse Hospital rule originally required that both medical and trauma cases be referred to a pediatrician and set a 
higher age limit of 16.  With changes in patient load and staffing, however, the rule was modified to its present form sometime 
prior to the merger of Little Traverse and Lockwood-MacDonald hospitals.  Apparently a further informal modification has 
recently changed the rule so that medical problems are also treated by the emergency room physician if the patient is admitted 
after midnight.  In that circumstance the pediatrician is called for consultation. "
410,22," We say ""in theory"" because the appellants have not actually presented any evidence as to the number of uncommitted 
children that are actually admitted to NMH with medical problems within the appellants' range of qualifications.  However, finding 
no evidence to support an inference of conspiracy this deficiency is superfluous to disposition of appellants' section 1 claims."
410,23," Exclusive dealing contracts are analytically similar to cases involving unilateral refusals to deal in that the defendant has, in an 
exclusive contract, unilaterally determined to deal only with a single entity.  Compare, United States v. Colgate & Company, 250 
U.S. 300, 63 L. Ed. 992, 39 S. Ct. 465 (1919); Byars v. Bluff City News Co., Inc., 609 F.2d 843, 863 (6th Cir. 1979), with Tampa 
Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320, 327-29, 5 L. Ed. 2d 580, 81 S. Ct. 623 (1961); Brown v. Hansen Publications, 
Inc., 556 F.2d 969, 970 (9th Cir. 1977). However, this category of cases is more helpful in analyzing whether a monopolist's 
refusal to deal with a potential competitor violates section 2 of the Sherman Act."
410,24," Unlike Hyde, 686 F.2d at 289, 293, there is no discernible ""tying"" arrangement in the present case, nor has one been alleged. "
411,25," 15 U.S.C. § 2 provides: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other 
person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be 
deemed guilty of a felony. . . ."
411,26," The District Court may, of course, still dispose of these claims by summary judgment if after development of the necessary 
facts it determines that no genuine issues of material fact remain for trial. "
412,27," NMH provided the District Court with an affidavit disclaiming that any point of competition existed between it and the 
appellants -- all of whom were members of the NMH medical staff. The appellants have provided no contrary evidence."
412,28," The appellants have admittedly not cogently defined a relevant product market.  In their initial complaint appellants alleged a 
conspiracy designed to eliminate them from the practice of ""medicine."" In oral arguments before the District Court appellants 
narrowed their concept of the market to that of ""primary care."" On appeal the appellants have focused their arguments on ""acute 
medical care."" Acute medical care, if a market, must include referrals from the emergency room for follow-up treatment in order 
to support the appellants' claims.  We assume the appellants intended this version of acute care.  Appellants have offered no 
evidence supporting their shifting definitions of the product market. Such a failure is typically fatal to a plaintiff's section 2 claims.  
See, e.g., Morton Bldgs. of Neb. v. Morton Bldgs., Inc., 531 F.2d 910, 918 (8th Cir. 1976). The defendants however, have not 
presented any probative evidence to contradict the appellants' various asserted markets.  For this reason in reviewing the grant 
of summary judgment we will assume that product market alleged which would prove most supportive of the appellants' 
respective claims."
412,29," This area of overlap, if it exists, might conceivably be as narrow as ""acute care referrals"" or ""acute care referrals for follow-up 
primary care."" See, e.g., E.I. duPont de Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. at 395-96; Byars v. Bluff City News, 609 F.2d at 852-53. See 
also Borden, Inc. v. FTC, 674 F.2d 498, 508-09 (6th Cir. 1982) (cert. granted, 461 U.S. 940, 103 S. Ct. 2115, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1298 
(1983) (discussing submarket analysis).  We intimate no view on whether such a market in fact exists as distinct from the 
broader classification of primary care and specialized secondary care.  It is an issue which must be considered first by the "
413,," District Court, however, prior to final disposition of the appellants' section 2 claims.  Similarly, the District Court must consider the 
relevant geographic dimensions of this market in evaluating these claims."
413,30," The record again does not reveal whether Petoskey is the relevant geographic market for acute care medicine assuming that 
acute care is a discernible product market.  The Burns Clinic may, of course, present contrary evidence to the District Court."
413,31," The clinic's monopoly is one created by a contract held lawful in this opinion.  See supra, at 954-956.  It is not, of course, a 
necessarily permanent one in that NMH controls its existence through competitive bidding."
413,32," The Burns Clinic apparently maintains, contrary to the District Court's assertions, primary care services in direct competition 
with the appellants.  This fact must also be evaluated by the District Court on remand."
413,33," Since NMH's pediatrician role was presumably endorsed and adopted by the hospital and there is no evidence of actual Burns 
Clinic input much less responsibility in its adoption, it should play no part in the decision on remand."
413,34," This is equally true in the context of section 2 monopolization and attempted monopolization claims.  See, e.g., Times-
Picayune, 345 U.S. at 627. In the present case, however, it is difficult to perceive what justification there could be for totally 
excluding the appellants -- all qualified by hospital rules -- from receiving their fair share of emergency room referrals. This 
matter is, of course, left for development by the District Court. "

be made a part of the multi-district litigation.  In March 1978 the Judicial Panel on Multi-district Litigation centralized in that 
district six cases pending in five districts charging major car rental companies with violation of the antitrust laws. In re Airport Car 
Rental Antitrust Litigation, 448 F. Supp. 273 (J. Pan. M.L. 1978). Currently the cases are awaiting the outcome of a petition for 
certiorari following the Ninth Circuit's affirmance of Judge Schwarzer's granting of a motion for summary judgment for 
defendants against one plaintiff.  In re Airport Car Rental Antitrust Litigation, 521 F. Supp. 568 (N.D. Cal. 1981) aff'd, 693 F.2d 
84 (9th Cir. 1982). These rulings involved the Noerr-Pennington exemption from antitrust law rather than state action immunity. 
This applies to lobbying and other attempts to influence official government action.  See United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 
381 U.S. 657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585 (1965); Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365

442,7," Defendants in this case have not asserted, and are unlikely to assert, the defense of in pari delicto against Charley's on the 
basis of this inter-island contract.  The doctrine was severely limited, if not dealt a fatal blow, by the Supreme Court in Perma 
Life Mufflers Inc. v. International Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 20 L. Ed. 2d 982, 88 S. Ct. 1981 (1968). The Ninth Circuit has, on several occasions, asserted the doctrine's demise, see, e.g., Royal Printing Co. v. Kimberly-Clark 
Corp., 621 F.2d 323, 326 n. 5 (9th Cir. 1980); Calnetics Corp. v. Volkswagen of America, Inc., 532 F.2d 674, 688-90 (9th Cir. 
1976), and has held that for public policy reasons the illegal conduct of an antitrust plaintiff does not completely and 
automatically bar his claim.  First Beverages, Inc. of Las Vegas v. Royal Crown Cola Co., 612 F.2d 1164, 1174-75 (9th Cir. 
1980); Memorex Corp. v. International Business Machines Corp., 555 F.2d 1379, 1380-82 (9th Cir. 1977). In Thi-Hawaii v. First Commerce Financial Corp., 627 F.2d 991 (9th Cir. 1980), its latest statement on the status of the in pari 
delicto defense, the Ninth Circuit recognized that the defense still exists to the extent of barring recovery by a plaintiff who is 
""truly complete[ly] involve[d] and participat[ing]"" in the illegal activity.  Perma Life, 392 U.S. at 140. The Ninth Circuit has adopted 
the ""but for"" test in determining whether a plaintiff's participation in the monopoly is so complete as to give the defendant an in 
pari delicto defense.  By this test a ""plaintiff's recovery is not barred unless the illegal conspiracy would not have been formed 
but for its participation.  See Javelin Corp. v. Uniroyal, Inc., 546 F.2d 276, 279 (9th Cir. 1976)."" Thi-Hawaii 627 F.2d at 995. In this circuit, therefore, a defense of in pari delicto can apparently only be successfully asserted against an antitrust plaintiff who 
was an original and meaningful participant in the monopolistic or conspiratorial conduct.  A late-comer like Charley's is likely to 
be safe from such a defense. "

443,9," Although most cases and commentators refer to Parker as the source of the state action doctrine, Judge Pence in Deak-Perera 
points out that this is actually a misconception; the doctrine always existed as part of the theory of federalism in which it is 
grounded.  Deak-Perera slip op. at 5."
443,10," My deference to Judge Pence's ruling is all the greater because I am a visiting judge designated only temporarily to Judge 
Pence's district.  By tradition and comity a judge in a multiple-judge district follows the prior decision of a brother judge upon the 
same question.  Buna v. Pacific Far East Line, Inc., 441 F. Supp. 1360 (N.D. Cal. 1977); In re Carmona, 224 F. Supp. 497 
(S.D. Cal. 1963); Rojas-Gutierrez v. Hoy, 161 F. Supp. 448 (S.D. Cal. 1958). Even without my ruling in this case, however, there 
was not complete unanimity in the District of Hawaii on the state action exemption issue; Judge Weigel in Leia, ruled as I have, 
that Midcal applies to the state defendants and that they have not demonstrated sufficient articulation and supervision, whereas 
Judge Pence found that Midcal did not apply to the same state defendants. Comity and tradition do not bind when a judge has a cogent reason or reasons for diverging from the ruling of his brother or 
brethren.  Id. In this case I believe I have such a cogent reason.  My reading of controlling Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit 
cases requires me to differ from the prior ruling of Judge Pence.  I note that the state action question will not be the first break 
with judicial comity in this complex series of airport antitrust cases.  In granting defendant's motions for summary judgment on 
the Noerr-Pennington question, Judge Schwarzer reconsidered and reversed the earlier ruling by Judge Renfrew on the same 
question in the same consolidated cases, albeit the motions were directed against a different plaintiff.  In Re Airport Car Rental 
Antitrust Litigation, 521 F. Supp. 568 (N.D. Cal. 1981); 474 F. Supp. 1072 (N.D. Cal. 1979). Further, there is one important difference between Deak-Perera and Charley's in terms of the statutory authorization upon which 
state defendants rely.  The currency concession in Deak-Perera is covered by chapter 102 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes which "
444,," mandates competitive bidding.  This bespeaks greater articulation of a state policy to displace competition than does the 
indeterminate grant of authority embodied in chapter 261, which applies to the taxi issue."
444,11," As the Court developed this test it also came to refer to the non-applicability of federal antitrust law to the states as an 
""immunity"" for the states.  This may well be a misnomer.  Parker applied standard state sovereignty federal preemption analysis 
in the context of antitrust law; it did not create an exception or immunity for states.  See Community Communications Co. v. 
City of Boulder, 455 U.S. 40, 60, 70 L. Ed. 2d 810, 102 S. Ct. 835 (1982) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting); M. Handler, Reforming the 
Antitrust Laws, 82 Colum. L. Rev. 1287, 1330 (1982). Perhaps the present confusion in this area stems from the readiness with 
which we attach labels to concepts, which subsequently give rise to legal consequences, frequently not intended or 
contemplated by the labeler."
444,12," In its most recent antitrust decision, Jefferson County Pharmaceutical Association, Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories et al., 460 U.S. 
150, 103 S. Ct. 1011, 74 L. Ed. 2d 882, 51 U.S.L.W. 4195 (1983), the Court adheres to its policy of applying the federal antitrust 
laws to state and local governmental bodies.  City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power and Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 55 L. Ed. 2d 
364, 98 S. Ct. 1123 (1978) is cited in the opinion for the proposition that cities and states are persons within the ambit of the 
Sherman Act. Jefferson continues the trend of nonexemption for the states, at least in their proprietary capacities. "
445,13," Application of the arcane analysis required by the Parker doctrine is surely not assisted merely because the Attorney General 
of Hawaii believes his legal shoulders are sufficiently broad for a bucket of water on both (or) on each one."
445,14," Because the state defendants base their case on the nonapplicability of the Midcal test to them, they do not specifically assert 
that the facts of this case pass muster under the test.  It is defendant SIDA who applies the test to the facts here.  However, I will 
refer only to defendants, without specifying, as I will presume that the state defendants would assert that their challenged 
conduct did in fact pass the Midcal test were they to be aware that I now hold that the test applies to them."

airports and air navigation facilities, including the construction, installation, equipment, maintenance, and operation at airports of 
buildings and other facilities for the servicing of aircraft or for the comfort, accommodation, and convenience of air travelers, and

though it does not have the exclusive control and operation of such airports. No officer, board or department of the State, or 
municipality, shall perform any function which is within the jurisdiction of the department without its approval, except for military 
purposes. (b) Acquisition of real property.  In the acquisition of real property and interests therein, the department of accounting and 
general services shall assist the department of transportation at its request, and assign thereto state officers and employees 
under its supervision for the making of surveys, abstracts, and otherwise as may be of assistance, for which services the 
department of transportation shall pay out of the appropriations available to it, unless the department of accounting and general 
services has a general fund appropriation for such services. (c) Structures and improvements.  All structures and improvements to land shall be initiated by the department of transportation 
and shall be constructed or made by or under the comptroller, in conformity with plans and specifications approved by the 
department of transportation, for which purpose the department of transportation shall make allotments of the funds under its 
control for expenditure by the comptroller and for services of the department of accounting and general services for which the 
department has no general fund appropriation. (d) Use of state and municipal facilities and services.  In carrying out this chapter, the department of transportation may use the 
facilities and services of other agencies of the State and of the municipalities of the State to the utmost extent possible, and the 
agencies and municipalities shall make available their facilities and services.  This subsection shall apply to the department of

arrangements with any person: (1) Granting the privilege of using or improving the airport or air navigation facility or any portion or facility thereof or space 
therein for commercial purposes; (2) Conferring the privilege of supplying goods, commodities, things, services, or facilities at the airport or air navigation 
facility; (3) Making available services, facilities, goods, commodities, or other things to be furnished by the department or its agents 
at the airport or air navigation facility; or (4) Granting the use and occupancy on a temporary basis by license or otherwise any portion of the land under its

thereby derive revenue therefrom. All the arrangements shall contain a clause that the land may be repossessed by the department when needed for aeronautics 
purposes upon giving the tenant temporarily occupying the same not less than thirty days' notice in writing of intention to 
repossess. Except as otherwise provided in this section, in each case mentioned in paragraphs (1), (2), (3) and (4), the department may 
establish the terms and conditions of the contract, lease, license, or other arrangement, and may fix the charges, rentals or fees 
for the privileges, services, or things granted, conferred, or made available, for the purpose of meeting the expenditures of the 
statewide system of airports set forth in section 261-5(a), which includes expenditures for capital improvement projects approved 
by the legislature.  Such charges shall be reasonable and uniform for the same class of privilege, service, or thing. The department shall enter into separate contracts with no more than two persons (""contractors"") for the sale and delivery of in-
bond merchandise at Honolulu International Airport, in the manner provided by law.  Each such contract shall confer the right to 
operate and maintain commercial facilities within the airport for the sale of in-bond merchandise and the right to deliver to the 
airport in-bond merchandise for sale to departing foreign-bound passengers. The department shall grant such contracts pursuant to the laws of this State and may take into consideration: (1) The payments to be made on in-bond merchandise sold at Honolulu International Airport and on in-bond merchandise 
displayed or sold elsewhere in the State and delivered to the airport; (2) The ability of the applicant to comply with all federal and state rules and regulations concerning the sale and delivery of 
in-bond merchandise; and (3) The reputation, experience, and financial capability of the applicant. The department shall actively supervise the operation of the contractors to insure its effectiveness.  The department shall 
develop and implement such guidelines as it may find necessary and proper to actively supervise the operations of such 
contractors, and shall include guidelines relating to the department's review of the reasonableness of contractors' price

that certain defendants have filed formal motions while others have only submitted supportive or reply memoranda ""joining in"" 
other defendants' formal motions.  To avoid confusion and needless balkanization, the Court will treat all defendants as having 
appropriately moved in all actions for summary judgment upon the general factual grounds which the states have had an 
opportunity to respond to in their two memoranda. "
461,5," In determining the existence of a genuine issue of material fact, a court views the record in the light most favorable to the non-
moving party.  Poller, 368 U.S. at 473; Neel, 639 F.2d at 1082; 2 P. Areeda & D. Turner, supra, at 58.  Exhuming legitimate 
disputes which might not otherwise be noticed, this principle particularly applies when conflicting inferences may be drawn ""from

654, 655, 8 L. Ed. 2d 176, 82 S. Ct. 993 (1962). Consequently, the following discussion primarily focuses upon the evidence in 
the record supporting the plaintiffs' allegations.  The Court recognizes that the record contains significant contrary evidence and 
obviously does not attempt to sit as the trier of fact at this early stage of the litigation.  However, for purposes of economy in a 
regrettably lengthy opinion, the Court will not dwell upon the defendants' contrary factual allegations."
461,6," Some indication exists that on occasion not all of the five accessories were actually applied to a given car.  However, as the 
parties appear to be in accord that all five components usually came together, the Court will follow the parties practice and 
assume for the sake of convenience that all five accessories were consistently applied."
461,7, The Court recognizes that the wholesale cost to the dealer as well as other relevant price figures varied over time. The Court will ignore all such minor monetary fluctuations. 
462,8," The Frederick Weisman Holding Company later changed its name to the Frederick Weisman Company.  Weisman apparently 
did not own stock in the holding company directly but instead controlled it through the ""Weisman Group,"" which in turn consisted 
of the Frederick R. Weisman Family Trust, Richard L. Weisman (Weisman's son), and Lerand, Inc. (an investment firm in which 
Frederick R. Weisman held a 5% equity interest and in which he and Richard L. Weisman each held 50% of the voting shares).  
The parties have simplified matters by stipulating that ""during all relevant times, Frederick R. Weisman directly, through 
members of his immediate family, or through corporate interests was a majority shareholder of relevant corporate entities."""

462,12," In accordance with the admonition that a court entertaining a summary judgment motion must view the record in the light most 
favorable to the non-moving party, the Court treats the Weisman defendants as a single economic unit for the purposes of this 
motion.  It is true that the Supreme Court has frequently invoked an ""intra enterprise conspiracy doctrine"" and declared 
commonly owned corporate entities to be legally distinct actors capable of conspiring together in violation of § 1.  United States "

(farmer's combination itself permissible under Capper-Volstead Act not distinct from its subsidiaries).  However, the Supreme 
Court has never fully elaborated on the parameters of this doctrine, and the Circuit Courts, no doubt prompted by criticism of the 
doctrine by learned commentators, see, e.g., P. Areeda, Antitrust Analysis para. 334 (3rd ed. 1981), have developed numerous 
exceptions to the general rule.  See generally authorities collected in Harvey v. Fearless Farris Wholesale, Inc., 589 F.2d 451, 
455-56 n. 8 (9th Cir. 1979). In particular, a ""one man show"" exception has recently evolved in the Ninth Circuit: corporate entities 
controlled by a single individual are treated as a single business unit when that individual made the relevant decisions.  
Thomsen v. Western Electric Co., Inc., 680 F.2d 1263, 1266 (9th Cir. 1982); Las Vegas Sun, Inc. v. Summa Corp., 610 F.2d 614 
(9th Cir. 1979); Harvey, 589 F.2d at 457; Knutson v. Daily Review, Inc., 548 F.2d 795 (9th Cir. 1976) (alternative holding).  The 
Court finds these authorities to be well reasoned and rules that as a matter of law a ""one man show"" exception exists to the 
general rule of intra-enterprise conspiracy. However, as the parties have not had an opportunity to marshall the facts in light of 
these principles, the Court will not definitively apply them to the particulars of this case at the present time.  The Court also 
reserves ruling on the disputed issue of whether the applicability of the intra-corporate conspiracy rule or its exception is itself a 
question of fact or law.  See generally discussion of authorities in Ogilvie v. Fotomat Corp., 641 F.2d 581, 588 (8th Cir. 1981)."
463,13," The defendants allege that the price of the protective package was lower than the sum of the retail prices of its constituent 
components. "
464,14," As a dealer joining the Double Value Days program was by the terms of the individual agreement relinquishing the possibility 
of additional per car profit, the only rational motivation which could be inferred from his participation in the program would be a 
desire to increase sales volume by ""giving away"" the protective package. Similarly, the Weisman defendants could have only 
sought to stimulate Toyota sales by establishing the Double Value Days program, since they were contractually relinquishing the 
profit they had garnered on the sale of the protective packages to the dealers."
464,15," While the parties disagree and the record is not clear on exactly how many Toyotas were equipped with Polyglycoat products 
before September, 1979, it appears beyond dispute that markedly fewer cars were equipped with the sealant before the program 
than were equipped during the program. "
465,16," For example, one dealer claims that he did not order the Polyglycoat because Crown Atlantic did a very sloppy job of applying 
the sealants at the port, necessitating a significant cleaning effort on the dealer's part."
465,17," MAT did not convene the meetings solely to promote the Total Concept Program.  Defendants allege that the Program was 
only one among many promotional efforts pushed at the meetings."
465,18," The parties dispute the extent to which the Harbridge House representatives stressed the need for ""joint"" action by the dealers 
to break out of the ""viscious cycle."""
465,19," The Court notes some inconsistency between the Harbridge representative's stress on lower per car profits and Abbott's 
claims of the potential for increased profits per car. This inconsistency might be resolved if one assumes that the price 
discrimination available with the protective package would equal a flat automatic discount in economic results."
465,20," Some deposition testimony also indicate that the dealers desired uniform adherence to the Program in order to (1) increase 
the efficiency of the port operation and hence speed the delivery of the cars to the dealers and (2) improve the possibility of 
interdealer exchanges of inventory to assist a dealer who had closed an unexpectedly large number of sales. "
467,21," A dealer might have attempted to contend that the contract was a ""tie"" in violation of § 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 14 
(1976). However, the dealer would have had to establish that MAT coerced him into taking the tied product along with the tying 
product.  Ogden Food Service Corp. v. Mitchell, 614 F.2d 1001, 1002 (5th Cir. 1980); Capital Temporaries, Inc. of Hartford v. 
Olsten Corp., 506 F.2d 658, 661-63 (2nd Cir. 1974). In the present case, the dealers plainly had the option of purchasing their 
1980 models without the protective package. While the individual Total Concept Program contracts posed no antitrust concerns, each individual Double Value Days contract 
did in fact create a vertical price fixing agreement, as discussed at page 783, infra. Plaintiffs do not appear to allege that the 
Double Value Days contracts taken collectively constituted an additional restraint of trade, and the Court will not consider that 
issue. "
469,22," The plaintiffs have alleged a conspiracy to raise the suggested retail price. However, the coexistence of the Monroney and 
Sherman Acts require that § 1 liability can attach only for a tacit agreement to increase the starting point in dealer/customer 
negotiations by the amount of the suggested retail price of the accessories. In other words, the dealers had to have impliedly 
agreed that each would not unilaterally discount the price of the Toyota before commencing negotiations with the customer. 
Such a unilateral reduction is what the Weisman defendants requested in the Double Value Days Program but is precisely the 
opposite of what Abbott urged each dealer to do in the initial Total Concept Program.  Abbott allegedly told the dealers that they 
could charge the full $533.00 and keep the resulting $420.00 unless the customer balked.  A tacit agreement among the dealers 
that each would do exactly what Abbott was suggesting would, as will be explained infra, create problems under the antitrust 
laws. The Court also notes that defendants assume that plaintiffs have alleged (1) an agreement among the dealers to order all of 
their Toyotas with the protective package with (2) the [agreed] purpose of raising the suggested price.  Defendants base many of 
their arguments about the proper definition of price fixing upon this characterization of plaintiffs' position.  The Court has carefully 
examined plaintiffs' submissions and believes that plaintiffs' position could also be characterized as: (1) an agreement among "
470,," the defendants to raise the suggested price (2) via the facilitating mechanism of uniform application of the protective package. 
Defendants do not squarely address this alternative position of plaintiffs and, when combined with their certainly justifiable failure 
to anticipate the Court's current ruling on the suggested/starting price distinction, appear understandably to assume as the 
premise of their price fixing argument that plaintiffs have not marshalled sufficient circumstantial evidence to raise a genuine 
issue about a tacit interdealer agreement to raise the starting price (as opposed to an interdealer agreement to order all of their 
Toyotas with the protective package).  As will be intimated later, many of defendants' arguments on the per se issue may have 
some merit if one assumes that the agreement in question is an agreement for uniform ordering of the protective package. 
However, before one determines the standard that must be employed to ascertain whether a tacit agreement is in restraint of 
trade, one must first determine what that tacit agreement is.  As the Court finds sufficient circumstantial evidence to raise an 
issue about a tacit agreement to raise the starting price, the Court will approach the per se issue with that agreement in mind.  
Plaintiffs of course should amend their pleadings to allege concerted action by a tacit agreement to raise the starting price."
470,23," For a more detailed explanation of this point, see page 783 infra. "
471,24," As will be described infra, ""vertical restraints"" frequently occur among firms operating at different levels of the production and 
distribution chain of a given product."
471,25," Express contracts of minimum resale price maintenance violate § 1 under Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons, Co., 
220 U.S. 373, 55 L. Ed. 502, 31 S. Ct. 376 (1911). "
472,26," Professor Areeda shares this concern over the inclusion of ""pawns"" as § 1 conspirators and queries whether the telephone 
company could be held to be a co-conspirator if competitors reached agreements on a restraint of trade over the telephone.  
Areeda, supra, at P 528."
472,27," The extent of this inconsistency revolves around the effectiveness of the Total Concept Program's ""discount only if the 
customer balks"" approach in approximating the sales results obtained if the dealer unilaterally reduced the price before the 
commencement of the customer negotiations. "
473,28," An example of a non price vertical restraint is the ""location clause"" found in Sylvania: a term in a manufacturer-retailer 
franchise agreement prohibiting the retailer from selling franchised products from locations other than those specified in the 
agreement."
473,29," Implicit in much of the Supreme Court's reasoning in Sylvania is the eminently reasonable assumption that interbrand 
competition should be the true focus of the antitrust laws in a non-monopolistic market. "
474,30," Defendants urge the Court to disregard the dicta of the Fourth Circuit in Rice as poorly reasoned and inconsistent with 
Sylvania, 433 U.S. at 36. However, the Court will not ignore the explicit directions of its reviewing tribunal, even if the comments 
of that tribunal were not inevitably required by the decision.  Furthermore, the Court regards the ""functional analysis"" adopted in 
the present case as fully consistent with and logically implied by Sylvania."
474,31," For purposes of convenience, the Court employs the term ""supplier"" to designate the entity on which is higher on the 
distribution scale than its co-conspirators, whether that entity be a manufacturer or, as here, a distributor."
474,32," As the Third Circuit observed in construing Sylvania, ""When a manufacturer acts on its own, pursuing its own market strategy, 
it is seeking to compete with other manufacturers by imposing what may be defined as reasonable vertical restraints.  This would 
appear to be the rationale of the GTE Sylvania decision [emphasis added]."" Cernuto, Inc. v. United Cabinet Corp., 595 F.2d 164, 
168 (3rd Cir. 1979). The Court's definition would encompass any act related to a supplier ""pursuing its own market strategy"" in a 
product."
474,33," The definition also encompasses certain categories of cases which defendants argue would be in effect overruled by a 
variation from the source rule.  For example, defendants point to those cases where the manufacturer initiating a restraint also 
competes with his distributors at the distribution level.  See, e.g., H & B Equipment Co. v. International Harvester Co., 577 F.2d 
239 (5th Cir. 1978). Such decisions uniformly retain a ""vertical"" characterization of the restraint.  Id. However, these decisions 
are fully consistent with the Court's formulation: a manufacturer acting to maximize profits by a restriction of intrabrand 
competition in the distribution of his product is still attempting to maximize his profits from that product.  A manufacturer might 
believe that greater efficiencies could be obtained by distributing more of his product directly; hence a court may not condemn 
out of hand a manufacturer's attempts to ensure that he retains certain distributional advantages for himself. Similarly, defendants' concern that a variation from a rigid source rule would ""eliminate tying doctrine"" is also misplaced.  While 
the Court's definition if rigorously applied would characterize a manufacturer-dealer ""tie"" as ""horizontal"" (since the manufacturer's 
acts with regard to the ""tying"" product are motivated by a desire for profits in the ""tied"" product), such a characterization has 
relevance only on the level of abstract theory.  The ""horizontal""/""vertical"" distinction has traditionally been made only in the areas 
of mergers and ""restricted distribution"" arrangements; tying constitutes a completely separate category of antitrust law with its 
own specific rules."
474,34," Additional support of this formulation may be found in the reasoning of those courts upholding the traditional per se treatment 
of restraints originating among the dealers. See, e.g., Cernuto, 595 F.2d at 168. The Third Circuit observed there: "". . . both the 
purpose and effect of . . . [the particular dealer-instigated restraint] was to eliminate competition at the retail level and not as in 
GTE Sylvania, to promote competition at the manufacturing level.  Accordingly, the pro competitive virtues so critical in GTE 
Sylvania may not be presented here."" Id. The definition adopted here would carry this rationale to its logical conclusion and "
475,," exclude from ""vertical"" characterization all those practices not directed at ""promoting competition at the manufacturers level"" and 
hence lacking ""the pro competitive virtues so critical in GTE Sylvania."""
475,35," If plaintiffs proceed with an alternative theory that the defendants ""conspired to order collectively all of their cars with the 
protective package with the purpose and effect of raising the starting price,"" then the issue will have to be addressed.  At this 
stage, it appears that horizontal restraints with the purpose and effect of raising prices are per se illegal, see, e.g., Catalano, Inc. 
v. Target Sales, Inc., 446 U.S. 643, 647, 64 L. Ed. 2d 580, 100 S. Ct. 1925 (1980); United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 
U.S. 150, 223, 84 L. Ed. 1129, 60 S. Ct. 811 (1940), but also that blind application of the ""purpose and effect"" doctrine in the 
vertical context would eviscerate settled Supreme Court doctrine in such areas as restricted distribution, Sylvania, 433 U.S. 36, 
97 S. Ct. 2549, and tying, United States Steel Corp. v. Fortner Enterprises, 429 U.S. 610, 51 L. Ed. 2d 80, 97 S. Ct. 861 (1977). 
However, the Court avoids any definitive exposition unless the parties subsequently make an actual decision necessary. "
476,36," Defendants understandably rely on Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U.S. 1, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1, 
99 S. Ct. 1551 (1979), in arguing that a narrower scope is appropriate for price fixing doctrine.  Broadcast Music asserts that a 
particular practice may not be condemned as price fixing, even if it ""literally"" sets prices, unless prior experience has convinced a 
court that that particular practice is plainly anticompetitive and very likely without redeeming virtue.  Broadcast Music, 441 U.S. 
at 9-10. If the Supreme Court's pronouncement is itself taken ""literally,"" then Socony and its progeny are effectively eliminated.  
Almost any able antitrust defense attorney would be able to characterize the particular actions of his clients as ""unique"" or 
""unfamiliar,"" thereby plunging a court into the very detailed competitive analysis that per se rules were designed to avoid.  
Perhaps recognizing the severe practical effects of Broadcast Music, the Supreme Court has not seen fit to follow the literal 
implications of the opinion in its subsequent price fixing decisions.  Maricopa, 50 U.S.L.W. at 4687, Catalano, 446 U.S. at 643. In 
particular, the Maricopa court condemned as illegal per se a very complicated and innovative health care plan allegedly 
designed to reduce health care costs.  Justice Powell in dissent strongly argued that this innovative arrangement presented just 
the sort of ""novel"" practice to which ""the per se label should not be assigned without carefully considering substantial benefits 
and pro competitive justifications."" Maricopa, 50 U.S.L.W. at 4695 (Powell, J., dissenting). Justice Powell later concluded that 
""the court's effort to distinguish Broadcast Music thus is unconvincing."" Id. Given this apparent retreat from Broadcast Music, the 
Court has no alternative but to follow the traditional Socony-Maricopa line of cases until the Supreme Court clearly indicates the 
contrary."
476,37," A copiously annotated opinion by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York provides further 
indication as to why an agreement to raise the starting price is properly within the reach of Socony.  Checker Motors Corp. v. 
Chrysler Corp., 283 F. Supp. 876 (S.D. N.Y. 1968) (Mansfield, J.).  In Checker, the plaintiff taxicab manufacturing company 
alleged that its manufacturing competitor Chrysler had conspired with Chrysler dealers to fix the retail price of Chrysler taxis.  
The sole basis for this allegation was Chrysler's policy of providing direct rebates from Chrysler itself to purchasers of Chrysler's 
taxis.  Denying plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, Judge Mansfield distinguished Plymouth Dealers and stated: Regardless of the absence of agreement as to a specific or uniform price, a wide variety of horizontal and vertical 
arrangements have been classified as price-fixing agreements and therefore condemned as unlawful per se, e.g. . . ., 
Plymouth Dealers Assn. of Northern Cal. v. United States, 279 F.2d 128 (9th Cir. 1960) (agreements on starting price for 
bargaining and trade-in allowances).  However, an essential element is the competitor's surrender, express or implied, of 
some measure of pricing discretion.  The evil of price-fixing agreements is that they "
477,," ""cripple the freedom of traders and thereby restrain their ability to sell in accordance with their own judgment."" ( Kiefer-
Stewart Co. v. Joseph Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U.S. 211, 213, 71 S. Ct. 259, 260, 95 L. Ed. 219 (1951)). Conduct or agreements not restricting a competitor's price independence, on the other hand, falls [sic] short of illegal price 
fixing . . . Thus, there is a failure to show any provision of the plan, or any facts, indicating that the plan would tend to affect 
the exercise of competitive pricing discretion, or to affect or tamper with the range, level, scale, or amount of the price paid 
for Chrysler taxicabs, such as appears in price-fixing or distribution agreements that have been struck down as 
unreasonable without more.  In the absence of proof that the Rebate Plan has a tendency to restrict the dealer's pricing 
independence, or has some pricing effect, it amounts to nothing more than a promotional device which cannot be labelled 
illegal per se. Id. at 882-83.  A starting price conspiracy, on the other hand, does contain a ""surrender, express or implied, of some measure of 
pricing discretion,"" and properly qualifies for per se treatment."
477,38," Albrecht has fared particularly poorly in the eyes of learned commentators.  See, e.g., Areeda, supra, at P 506. "
478,39," In another case involving the application of the same protective package to 1980 (and 1979) Toyotas, the United States 
District Court for the Northern District of Alabama has ruled that the legality of alleged restraints initiated by the Toyota distributor 
for the southeastern United States would be tried under a Rule of Reason standard. Moore v. Southeast Toyota Distributors, 
Inc., Civil 81-P-0491-S (N.D. Ala. June 22, 1982).  As the Moore court provided no memorandum along with its order, one 
cannot ascertain what authorities Judge Pointer relied upon in reaching his decision.  In addition, the precise restraint Judge 
Pointer was reviewing and its potential similarity to the present facts remain unclear.  In a previous order denying class 
certification, Judge Pointer indicated that the Toyota distributor for a significant period of time had actually discounted the entire 
price of the protective package on the Monroney sticker.  Moore v. Southeast Toyota Distributors, 1982-2 Trade Cas. para. 
64,743 (N.D. Ala. 1982). Besides causing no harm to the consumer, see infra, such an act without more appears to support an 
inference of unilateral distributor behavior beyond the scope of § 1.  Given such significant factual variances, the Court does not 
believe that Moore permits it to part company with the authorities reviewed above. "
480,40," Defendants argue that plaintiffs must show that each consumer was ""coerced"" into buying the protective package in order to 
establish injury.  However, the consumers' injury arises not from an ""unwanted"" purchase of the Toyota with the protective 
package but in paying more for the Toyota with the protective package than they would have paid for the Toyota with the 
protective package in the absence of the conspiracy. Defendants contend that the fact that the purchaser received something of 
at least some value as part of the transaction is being ignored, but the Court explicitly incorporates this inherent ""off-set"" into the 
damage formula."
480,41," Plaintiffs claim that they do not know for certain that the dealers actually adhered to their end of the deal and unilaterally 
discounted the suggested price.  However, to the extent this occurred, it would indicate that the consumer was ""injured"" not as a 
result of any concerted action but because the dealer/distributor contract was breached. "
490,*," The Honorable Walter Hoffman, Senior District Judge of the Eastern District of Virginia, is sitting by designation. "
492,1," The other defendants, directors and officers of Reserve and ARC, do not challenge in their brief on appeal the Director's right to 
proceed against them on any basis other than RICO."
492,2," Some defendants have also characterized this procedural bar as a substantive one, arguing that the complaint must fail 
because its facts demonstrate that the Director will be unable to demonstrate causation of fraud, given the corporation's imputed 
knowledge.  Because both characterizations raise the same issue, both will be dealt with under the ""estoppel"" heading. "
493,3," Although we need not reach the question for the purpose of this appeal, we note our agreement with the proposition that the 
Director may pursue no action which could not have been asserted directly by Reserve before liquidation. This conclusion is 
supported first by the plain text of the statute which provides that HN2[
] the Director as Liquidator ""shall be vested by 
operation of law with the title to all property, contracts and rights of action of the company as of the date of the order . . . directing 
liquidation."" Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 73, § 803 (emphasis added). Second, a century of interpretation of this and its predecessor provisions has established the basic rule that HN3[
] ""where a 
receiver is appointed for the purpose of taking charge of the property and assets of a corporation, he is, for the purpose of 
determining the nature and extent of his title, regarded as representing only the corporate body itself, and not its creditors or 
shareholders . . . .  He takes only the rights of the corporation such as could be asserted in its own name, and that upon that 
basis, only, can he litigate for the benefit of other shareholders or creditors."" Republic Life Insurance Co. v. Swigert, 135 Ill. 150, 
167, 25 N.E. 680 (1890); People ex rel. Barret v. Bank of Peoria, 295 Ill. App. 543, 549, 15 N.E.2d 333, 335-36 (1938); 
Sangamon Loan & Trust Co. v. People's Savings Bank & Trust Co., 204 Ill.App. 7, 14 (1917); Golden v. Cervenka, 278 Ill. 409, 
437, 116 N.E. 273, 284 (1917) see also 19 Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, § 10682 at 122, 123 (1982); 2 Couch on 
Insurance 2d, § 22:48 (1959).  A narrow exception to this rule has been permitted where, unlike here, the receiver sues to 
recover on behalf of a plaintiff's creditors a specific asset from a defendant who has, with the knowledge of the plaintiff's 
corporate officials, misrepresented its existence.  Sangamon, 204 Ill.App. at 14; Golden, 278 Ill. at 427; see also Wheeler v. 
American National Bank, 347 S.W. 2d 918, 925, 165 Tex. 502 (Tex. 1961); Magnusson v. American Allied Insurance Co., 290 
Minn. 465, 189 N.W.2d 28, 33 (1971). Bonhiver v. Graff, 311 Minn. 111, 248 N.W.2d 291 (1976) and McTamany v. Day, 23 
Idaho 95, 128 P.563 (1912), cited by the Director, are distinguishable.  The statute involved in Bonhiver, Minn.Stat.Ann. § 60 B. 
25 (13), authorized the liquidator to assert claims of creditors and policyholders, while in McTamany, the court held only that the 
receiver could proceed on behalf of creditors and policyholders against the insolvent company's directors, not extracorporate 
parties.  McTamany, 128 P. at 565. In any event, to the extent that either of these cases can be read to authorize an insurance 
liquidator to pursue claims more extensive than those accruing to the corporation itself, they conflict with the clear rule fashioned 
by the Illinois courts and the leading authorities.  It is therefore incumbent upon this court not to effect innovation in what appears 
to be settled state law.  Murphy v. White Hen Pantry Co., 691 F.2d 350, 355 (7th Cir. 1982). "
494,4," These defendants argue that, since Reserve was a wholly-owned subsidiary of ARC, the owners of Reserve, i.e. ARC 
shareholders, automatically benefited from the direct draining of Reserve and the fraudulent prolongation of Reserve's life.  This 
argument founders on both logic and fact.  First, it defies common sense to suggest that a parent corporation's shareholders are 
not injured when their directors fraudulently prop up, drain, and thereby deepen the insolvency of a subsidiary for whose 
liabilities the shareholders will eventually be liable.  The damage resulting to the parent corporation's shareholders is as real as if 
the management had impaired a valuable working asset or sold it for a meager sum far less than its present value.  Second, as 
a factual matter, the complaint alleges that not all of the proceeds resulting from the crippling of Reserve redounded to the 
benefit of ARC and ARC's shareholders. According to the allegations, as a result of the SCOR agreements, ARC was secretly 
exposed to increased liability for GRC's performance; also as part of these agreements, SCOR allegedly received additional 
payments from ARC in excess of $ 2,500,000 for its assistance in furthering the scheme. "
495,5," The defendants have argued that, due to the statutory authorization of treble damages in RICO civil actions, Reserve's 
shareholders will experience an enormous windfall recovery to the extent of the full damage increment exceeding single 
damages.  This is not necessarily the case, however, for under the controlling statute, the shareholders will receive only the last 
residual of Reserve's estate, not a share of each recovery before it is added to that estate.  As noted, there are other prior claims 
on that estate which must be satisfied first, including wages, administration costs, and the claims of policyholders and creditors 
which may well exceed the amount, or even triple the amount, asserted to have arisen from the damages to the corporation 
claimed in the present action. Without knowledge of the size of each of these prior claims, evidence of which has not been 
presented at this stage, we decline to speculate on the existence or relative size of any recovery to Reserve's shareholders. Moreover, since the deterrence policy of Cenco is a forward-looking one, we should apply it with the normal case in mind and 
not be overly swayed by the fortuity of a treble damage provision which may in some cases result in a large recovery to a 
plaintiff's shareholders. This is especially so where to hold otherwise, as here, would do immense damage to the policy 
underlying the statutory liquidation process: the protection of the interests of policyholders, shareholders and creditors jointly by 
the Director. "
496,6," In Kinter v. Connolly, 233 Pa. 5, 81 A. 905 (1911), for example, the lower court noted specifically that in ""the bill before us . . . 
there is no averment that any act or omission of the defendants . . . caused loss or injury to the company."" 81 A. at 905. "
497,7," The defendants argue that there is no place in the instant appeal for application of the liberal pleading policy embodied in 
Murphy v. White Hen Pantry Co. and Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80, 78 S. Ct. 99 (1955), because the basic 
question to be decided here concerns the alleged absence of federal jurisdiction, and not a 12(b)(6) -- related challenge to the 
sufficiency of the complaint.  However, the liberal construction policy of Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(f) is not limited to the context of 
12(b)(6) motions.  Moreover, although this case is not formally an appeal of denial of a 12(b)(6) motion, the defendants' assault 
on the technical adequacy of the complaint raises the identical issue involved in such an appeal; we therefore find it appropriate 
to seek guidance from precedents addressing that procedure. The defendants argue that liberal construction and amendment of the Director's complaint is especially inappropriate here 
because the latter was admonished in proceedings below to make sure that its pleadings were sufficient before the appeal was 
certified.  The Director declined to do so, but only in the face of statements by some of the defendants that they would object to 
such an attempt to amend the complaint, and that, in any case, their primary challenge to the Director's complaint was that no 
set of facts describing the alleged events, however arranged, could support the invocation of RICO.  We also take note of the 
extraordinary conceptual disarray and schism even among district courts in this circuit, discussed infra, as to the proper 
elements of a RICO pleading.  Under these circumstances, we decline to penalize the Director for failing to state the summary 
portions of his RICO allegation with technical precision, especially where his preceding factual allegations amply support on their 
face a proper RICO claim. "
498,8," Not only did the existence of these numerous paragraphs detailing the defendants' participation in ARC's affairs give notice to 
the defendants of the Director's § 1962 theory, but also any arguable prejudice resulting from an amendment would be minimal 
in view of the preliminary status of the case at present.  Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, § 1487 (1971). "
499,9," As Representative Mikva noted in House debate, My objection to the bill in toto is that whatever its motives to begin with, we will end up with cases involving all kinds of 
things not intended to be covered, and a potpourri of language by which you can parade all kinds of horribles of overreach .

continuing for a period of two days, then [they] have been running an organized gambling business and [they] can get 20

at this stage, adequate to suggest that SCOR could have been aware of the misleading impact of the secret guarantee. "

513,1," For further elaboration of the facts regarding the role of the rate bureaus, their relationship with the state regulatory 
commissions, and the general pattern of regulatory procedures in the five subject states, see the district court's carefully written 
opinion.  United States v. Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc., 467 F. Supp. 471, 476-78 (N.D.Ga.1979)."
513,2," In the district court, the state attorneys general of the states of Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Tennessee 
participated as amici curiae.  The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) also was allowed to 
participate as an intervenor. "
514,3," Appellants seek to characterize Parker as a case in which individual growers were not compelled to act anticompetitively, citing 
a provision of the program which permitted growers to set aside up to 30% of their crops for sale on the free market. The 30% 
set-aside provision, however, did not affect the ability of a grower to elect not to participate as to the remaining 70% of his crops.  
In this sense, the state mandated the participation of every grower and compelled the challenged anticompetitive behavior."
514,4," [**7] Significantly, this reference to federalism concerns was directed not to any limitation on Congress' power to act; instead, it 
was stated merely as a rule of statutory interpretation -- that is, whether and to what extent Congress had chosen to override 
existing state regulation."
514,5," The State Bar was, for ""some limited purposes,"" a state agency.  421 U.S. at 791, 95 S. Ct. at 2015. But because the fee 
schedule itself was published by the county bar association, we agree with those who characterize Goldfarb as an action against 
a private party. Cf.  Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433 U.S. 350, 97 S. Ct. 2691, 53 L. Ed. 2d 810 (1977) (antitrust claims raised 
only against state bar, which was a state defendant). "
515,6," HN4[
] In determining whether compulsion is present, we do not believe that private parties may have no role in proposing 
mandatory state action. In Parker and New Motor Vehicle Bd. v. Orrin W. Fox Co., 439 U.S. 96, 99 S. Ct. 403, 58 L. Ed. 2d 361 
(1979), the Supreme Court made it clear that an action still may be compelled by the state even though private parties petitioned 
the state to consider requiring such action.  See also California Motor Transp. Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 92 S. Ct. 
609, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1972); United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965); 
Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961). In Cantor, 
formal compulsion was present despite the fact that Detroit Edison could with little difficulty have petitioned the state commission 
for discontinuance of the program which the company itself had proposed.  Thus, by compulsion we mean something less than 
that envisioned by some commentators.  See e.g., 1 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law para. 215 (1978).  Still, once a state 
has adopted some policy, whether or not after a petition by a private party, private parties will be exempt from the antitrust laws 
only if the state requires some action pursuant to that policy."
515,7," [**12] In a prior part of the opinion (Part II) Justice Stevens, joined only by three other members of the Court, concluded that 
Parker should be limited to suits against state officials."
515,8," The disagreement in the Court centered on what in addition to compulsion was required for state action immunity for private 
parties. In fact, Justice Stewart, joined by Justices Powell and Rehnquist, argued that Michigan's decision to adopt Detroit 
Edison's proposal and then compel compliance with it should have been by itself sufficient for state action immunity. "
516,9," Another rationale for the compulsion requirement is that HN7[
] if a private party is permitted by the state to make the choice 
whether or not to compete, there is no necessary conflict between state and federal law because the private party may comply 
with both federal and state law at the same time."
516,10," We acknowledge that Bates and Parker, which involved state defendants, discussed the presence of compulsion, but we view 
those cases -- as appellants would have us do -- as instances in which the presence of compulsion provides the best evidence 
of clear articulation and affirmative expression of state policy to displace competition."
516,11," The district court found that ""regardless of the virtual romance between the states and the ratemaking conferences, no state 
requires that rates be published collectively."" 467 F. Supp. at 483 (emphasis in original).  An analysis of each state's policies 
reveals the correctness of the district court's finding.  HN9[
] North Carolina General Statute § 62-152.1(b) states that in order to realize and effectuate the policy of uniform rates among carriers, any party to an agreement with other carriers regarding 
uniform rates may apply to a state commission for approval of the agreement; Section 62-152.1(h) relieves parties to an 
agreement so approved from the operation of the antitrust laws. The statute does no more than authorize or permit collective 
ratemaking. There is no compulsion. HN10[
] Tennessee Public Service Commission Rule 1220-2-1.40 adopts Section 5a of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S. C.A. § 10706(b), which permits carriers to file joint rates and exempts those who do file 
such rates from the antitrust laws. In addition, Tenn.  Code Ann. § 65-1506 permits the Public Service Commission to establish 
joint ratemaking procedures.  Again, there is no state compulsion. HN11[
] Georgia Code Ann. § 68-613, which requires a 
state commission to ""establish ratemaking procedures for all motor common carriers, which procedure shall include, but not be 
limited to, collective ratemaking procedures,"" explicitly indicates that Georgia intends to give carriers the option of filing rates "
517,," jointly or individually.  The State of Georgia, participating as amicus in the district court, presented a 1942 order issued by its 
public service commission stating that ""all for hire motor common carriers operating under Class A certificates be, and they are 
hereby, directed and required to publish and file with this Commission . . . a tariff containing all local and joint class and/or 
commodity rates applicable between points within Georgia."" Pointing to the italicized language, the state argued that the 
commission ""clearly directed all Class 'A' carriers to file a single joint tariff with the Commission,"" thus indicating its policy in favor 
of collective action.  Id. We are not persuaded that the language of the 1942 order is susceptible of only this interpretation.  At 
best it is ambiguous.  Given the statute, only recently amended to insert the provisions outlined above, it would not, in any event, 
be controlling.  A 1942 order of the Alabama Public Service Commission requires carriers to ""prepare, publish and file with the 
Commission an individual tariff or . . . participate in an agency issue."" As with Georgia, Alabama explicitly permits individual rate 
applications.  Finally, HN12[
] Mississippi in Miss.Code Ann. §§ 77-7-1 to -341 merely contemplates cooperation among carriers to the limited extent of establishing ""joint rates."" This falls short of compelling joint applications for proposed rates."
517,12," The government points out that the district court conducted no fact-finding as to this issue.  The record, however, reveals that 
the state commissions conduct hearings to review the reasonableness of proposed carrier tariffs and routinely suspend their 
effectiveness. "
518,13," In the Supreme Court, petitioner California Retail Liquor Dealers Association had appealed the case as an intervenor."
518,14," In any event, compulsion was in fact present in Midcal.  See 445 U.S. at 100, 100 S. Ct. at 940."
518,15," [**23] Appellants cite several lower court cases in support of their position, but only two of them actually found that private 
parties were immune without compulsion by the state.  The first, Caribe Trailer Systems, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Maritime Shipping 
Authority, 475 F. Supp. 711 (D.D.C.1979), aff'd per curiam, No. 79-1658 (D.C.Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 914, 101 S. Ct. 
1355, 67 L. Ed. 2d 339 (1981), a district court opinion, is of only limited relevance because in that case the court reviewed a 
governmental restraint involving a private party (and a state defendant) rather than, as here, a private restraint approved by the 
government.  In the second case, Turf Paradise, Inc. v. Arizona Downs, 670 F.2d 813 (9th Cir.1982), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 
1011, 102 S. Ct. 2308, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1308 (1982), in which the Ninth Circuit reviewed an antitrust challenge to a private 
agreement allocating horse racing dates between two race track operators, the state had by statute specifically reserved the 
right to perform the allocation in the event that the private parties could not agree.  Id. at 816. Thus, although the state did not 
compel the private parties to enter into the racing date agreement, it had effectively ensured that the anticompetitive conduct 
would occur one way or another."
518,16," Appellants reason that the Court eliminated the compulsion requirement because the basis for state compulsion is the concern 
that the economic self interest of private parties might affect the rate setting process and, according to appellants, the second 
standard in Midcal -- the requirement of state supervision -- assuages that concern.  They assert that a supervision requirement 
adequately ensures that the state has determined that the challenged activity is in furtherance of the state's policy and that the 
state does not abdicate its responsibility to private parties. We disagree with this analysis.  If the second Midcal standard 
accomplished as much as appellants claimed, there would have been no need for the first standard.  Further, if compulsion and 
supervision served the same purpose, the Supreme Court would have upheld, rather than denied, state action immunity in "
519,," Midcal because compulsion was present in that case.  See 445 U.S. at 99-100, 100 S. Ct. at 940-941. That the Court did not 
reach this result is evidence that supervision and compulsion serve different purposes.  In our view, HN15[
] both supervision 
and compulsion are necessary for a finding of state action. A state cannot deprive competitors of their ability to subvert 
competition merely by compelling them to formulate collective rates.  Conversely, active supervision of anticompetitive conduct 
undertaken at the voluntary election of a private party also is not by itself adequate.  For example, a state may by regulation 
supervise the reasonableness of rates, but the reasonableness of any particular rate may have little to do with whether it was 
arrived at anticompetitively.  A state regulatory system does not even necessarily have the regulatory power to supervise 
anticompetitive behavior if the resulting rate falls somewhere within the zone of reasonableness.  As we stated earlier, 
compulsion serves an entirely different purpose from supervision: as Goldfarb and Parker established, the compulsion inquiry is 
to determine whether the specific anticompetitive activity at issue was actually that of the state acting as sovereign."
519,17,"  HN17[
] The mere fact that anticompetitive conduct by a private party effectuates a clearly articulated state regulatory 
policy is not in itself sufficient to justify a state action defense against injunctive relief.  The defense is only available if the 
state has elected to effectuate its policy by requiring the private conduct under attack. Note, Parker v. Brown Revisited: The State Action Doctrine After Goldfarb, Cantor and Bates, 77 Colum.L.Rev. 898, 916 (1977) 
(emphasis in original).  The Note, at the end of the relevant section, was even more definite: ""To summarize, a state action 
defense against injunctive relief should be available for private conduct only if the state has specifically required the conduct in 
question without abdicating final decisionmaking authority to private parties."" Id. at 918. The same footnote in the Midcal opinion also cited Norman's on the Waterfront, Inc. v. Wheatley, 444 F.2d 1011, 1018 (3d 
Cir.1971), and Asheville Tobacco Bd. v. FTC, 263 F.2d 502, 509-10 (4th Cir. 1959), in which state action defenses were refused.  
Although both cases are ambiguous as to the requirements for state action, neither one implies that compulsion is not necessary 
for private parties. "
520,18," Thus, a state may exempt a specific subclass of carriers from regulation or, as in Parker, it may predetermine a set amount or 
type of activity that may remain in the free market. In both of these cases, the state controls and sets the terms of the individual 
decision as to whether to compete. But where the option to compete or join a system of state regulation at all is up to the private 
party, state action does not exist."
520,19," We note that the government did not seek to enjoin the rate bureaus from performing joint rate studies or from undertaking 
joint publication of individual rates and agreements involving two or more parties who provide joint service."
520,20," We also agree with the panel's determination that HN20[
] there is no implied immunity from the antitrust laws resulting from the antitrust exemption granted motor carriers under 49 U.S.C.A. § 10706, or from the existence of pervasive state regulation 
permitted by 49 U.S.C.A. § 10521(b).  See 672 F.2d at 475 n. 9. "
521,1," There may be substantive limits on what conduct the state may immunize by making the challenged restraint a state policy. 
Indeed, there is some suggestion in Supreme Court precedent that federal antitrust laws do place substantive limits on the 
content of state economic regulation. See, e.g., Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert Distillers Corp., 341 U.S. 384, 71 S. Ct. 745, 95 L. 
Ed. 1035 (1951) (invalidating a Louisiana fair trade statute containing a ""non-signer"" provision under which a retailer could be 
enjoined from knowingly underselling another retailer whose prices were set under a resale price maintenance contract, exempt 
from antitrust laws under the Miller-Tydings Act, with a supplier).  But see P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law para. 212 at 70 
(1978) (interpreting this decision as an inadequate supervision case).  See generally Posner, The Proper Relationship Between "
522,," State Regulation and the Federal Antitrust Laws, 49 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 693 (1974). These limits may be reached in areas that have 
not been traditionally regulated by states. Here, however, the states are involved in a type of private utility regulation. The ability to regulate motor carriers involved in 
intrastate activities not only is a traditional state regulatory function, but also is an authority conferred on the states by the 
Congress.  49 U.S.C.A. § 10521(b) (West Supp.1982)."
522,2," In Parker the Court concluded that ""The Sherman Act makes no mention of the state as such, and gives no hint that it was 
intended to restrain state action or official action directed by a state."" 317 U.S. at 351, 63 S. Ct. at 313. The state action doctrine 
therefore was enacted to effectuate Congressional intent that state restraints on competition would not be prohibited.  However, 
""there is nothing to indicate that the Congress of 1890 intended to leave state-compelled restraints intact but to subject state-
authorized restraints to antitrust."" M. Handler, Reforming Antitrust Laws 64-65 (1982)."
522,3," At least one commentator has suggested that ""the compulsion requirement was an overreaction to the facts presented in 
Goldfarb, where the conduct challenged was actually contrary to the pronouncements of the state, and in Cantor, where the 
state agency never addressed the practice involved in any meaningful manner."" M. Handler, supra at 64.  Professor Areeda also 
agrees with this assessment: Indeed, Goldfarb and Cantor may be readily explained as decisions resting not on the absence of compulsion, but rather on 
the absence of any sort of meaningful state participation in the challenged conduct.  In Goldfarb, the defendants were 
private groups enforcing fee schedules without adequate state authority or supervision. The essence of Cantor was the "
523,," state's presumed indifference to the utility's ""free"" light bulb program; state approval, even if deliberate, was not intended to 
displace the antitrust laws.  Areeda, Antitrust Immunity for ""State Action"" After LaFayette, 95 Harv.L.Rev. 435, 439 n. 19 (1981)."
523,4," Prior to Midcal, Professors Areeda and Turner observed that the precise meaning of the compulsion test and its role in 
determining immunity was left unclear by Goldfarb and Cantor. 1 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law para. 215 at 93 (1978); 
accord Caribe Trailer Systems, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Maritime Shipping Authority, 475 F. Supp. 711, 724-25 (D.D.C.1979). Thus, 
they proposed that two requirements were essential to sustain a defense of state action immunity: ""(1) adequate public 
supervision and (2) a clear state purpose to displace antitrust law."" Areeda & Turner, supra, para. 212 at 71.  The similarity 
between this proposal and the test eventually adopted in Midcal suggests that the Court perceived the reasonableness of 
dropping its earlier compulsion language and adopting a simple and clear rule of general applicability. "
524,5,"  While we treat these as separate requirements, we nevertheless want to stress their interrelationship.  The existence of 
state supervision over anticompetitive behavior may, for example, indicate the requisite state intent as well.  Similarly, 
inaction on the part of the state may both represent a failure of supervision and reflect an ambiguous state purpose."
524,1," P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law P212 at 71 (1978)."
524,6,"  The existence of a state action immunity enables states, like the federal government itself, to define areas inappropriate for 
market control.  Moreover, the adequate supervision criterion ensures that state-federal conflict will be avoided in those 
areas in which the state has demonstrated its commitment to a program through its exercise of regulatory oversight.  At the 
same time, it guarantees that when the Sherman Act is set aside, private firms are not left to their own devices.  Rather, "
525,," immunity will be granted only when the state has substituted its own supervision for the economic constraints of the 
competitive market."
525,1," P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law para. 213 at 73 (1978) (footnotes omitted)."
525,7," Professor Areeda has even suggested that Midcal's active supervision requirement may be inapplicable to governmental 
defendants.  Areeda, Antitrust Immunity for ""State Action"" After Lafayette, 95 Harv.L.Rev. 435, 445 n. 50 (1981) (""A few courts 
erroneously appear to use the Midcal formula (clearly articulated state policy plus active supervision of private parties) to require 
state supervision of governmental defendants."") In Community Communications Co. v. City of Boulder, however, the Supreme 
Court expressly declined to decide whether the active supervision criterion must be met by a municipality with respect to the 
challenged ordinance.  455 U.S. 40, 102 S. Ct. 835, 841 n. 14, 70 L. Ed. 2d 810 (1982)."
525,1," Described in the majority opinion, at 534. "
528,*," The Honorable Edward Dumbauld, Senior District Judge, United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, 
sitting by designation. "
529,1," Missouri Valley also contends (1) that the district court failed to comply with Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e)(4) by not affording it an 
opportunity to withdraw its plea, and (2) that the district court abused its discretion in assessing the maximum fine under the 
Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1 (1976)."
529,2, Appellant's contention with respect to the district court's alleged violation of Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e)(4) is thus rejected.
529,3," Nor is there any constitutional requirement that a district court permit a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea when that court 
decides after the hearing not to accept a recommendation for sentencing. Cf.  Lindner v. Wyrick, 644 F.2d 724, 728 (8th Cir.) 
(when defendant is aware that plea is not in exchange for particular sentence but hopes state trial court will follow sentence 
recommendation, defendant not misled so as to undermine voluntariness of plea if court rejects sentence recommendation), 
cert. denied, 454 U.S. 872, 70 L. Ed. 2d 178, 102 S. Ct. 345 (1981)."
529,4," The full text of amended rule 11(e)(2) provides as follows: (2) HN1[
] Notice of Such Agreement. If a plea agreement has been reached by the parties, the court shall, on the record, 
require the disclosure of the agreement in open court or, on a showing of good cause, in camera, at the time the plea is 
offered.  If the agreement is of the type specified in subdivision (e)(1)(A) or (C), the court may accept or reject the 
agreement, or may defer its decision as to the acceptance or rejection until there has been an opportunity to consider the 
presentence report.  If the agreement is of the type specified in subdivision (e)(1)(B), the court shall advise the defendant "
530,," that if the court does not accept the recommendation or request the defendant nevertheless has no right to withdraw his 
plea. Prior to the 1979 amendment, rule 11(e)(2) read as follows: (2) Notice of Such Agreement. If a plea agreement has been reached by the parties, the court shall, on the record, require 
the disclosure of the agreement in open court or, on a showing of good cause, in camera, at the time the plea is offered.  
Thereupon the court may accept or reject the agreement, or may defer its decision as to the acceptance or rejection until 
there has been an opportunity to consider the presentence report."
530,5," We need not reach appellant's alternative argument that the district court abused its discretion in assessing the maximum fine 
under the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1 (1976). We observe, however, that HN3[
] a sentence imposed by a district judge, if 
within statutory limits, is generally not subject to review.  United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443, 447, 30 L. Ed. 2d 592, 92 S. Ct. 
589 (1972); United States v. Ross, 666 F.2d 1163, 1165 (8th Cir. 1981). We further observe that the district court gave careful 
consideration not only to the severity of the offense but also to arguments urged by appellant in mitigation.  Finally, we note that 
the district court allowed the appellant to pay the fine over a five-year period so as not to bring appellant ""to its knees,"" and that 
other Kiewit corporations were protected from antitrust prosecution for bid rigging. "

exercise in futility.  The plea of guilty is a solemn act not to be disregarded because of belated misgivings about the wisdom of 
the same."""
532,5," Ibid., at 25-26. "
533,6," To ensure the voluntary nature of the plea and to manifest that nature indisputably on the record are the two main objectives of

forms the second objective of Rule 11.  See note 6, supra."
533,8," This refers to the company of which defendant is a subsidiary, and all other subsidiaries in Kansas and Oklahoma, in addition

533,9," In other States than Kansas, Oklahoma, and Nebraska the government reserved the right to prosecute Kiewit companies or

534,10," This classification of pleas reminds one of the categories of reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 368, 
of which practitioners discourse blithely as ""B reorganizations"" and the like.  See Rabkin and Johnson, Federal Income, Gift and 
Estate Taxation, Vol. III, chapter 32, § 32.01 et seq."
534,11," Under the remedy fashioned by the Supreme Court under its supervisory power (394 U.S. at 464), withdrawl of the plea is the 
appropriate remedy for any deviation from the procedures prescribed by Rule 11.  In the case at bar, however, such a 
consequence clearly conflicts with the policy which characterizes a (B) plea as one which cannot be withdrawn because of 
rejection by the Court of the sentencing recommendation contained in the type (B) plea."

584,2," The Court specifically does not address the question whether a suit brought under these terms would violate any antitrust laws.  
The suit was not brought under these terms, and any questions relative to them are therefore moot."
584,3," The telex of February 23 reads in pertinent part: ""Before we start litigation against Roj we must have a binding confirmation that 
you will fulfill the conditions of your exclusive license for at least a certain period of time."""
584,4," And cf. Kinkeldey testimony, Tr. 638 (Iro did not consult with Wesco concerning its acquisition of the Tannert patent); Geiger 
testimony, Tr. 679 (Q [by counsel for Wesco]: Did Wesco play any part in the acquisition of the Tannert patent by Iro?  A: No, 
none.  In fact, we didn't even learn of it until well after it was finalized, apparently.) Even assuming arguendo that Wesco knew that Iro was acquiring the Tannert patent in February, 1977, knowledge without 
more does not make Wesco a conspirator in the acquisition of this patent. Peck v. United States, 470 F. Supp. 1003 (S.D.N.Y. 
1979); Byrd v. Local Union No. 24, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, 375 F. Supp. 545 (D. Md. 1974). Certainly 
where there is no participation by Wesco in Iro's acquisition, there can be no basis for finding that Wesco joined a conspiracy to 
acquire the patent. "
585,5," In their brief, defendants suggest that this offer to license came so belatedly that it was not an action taken in good faith.  
(Defendants' Reply Brief, at 6).  I find this contention without merit.  Roj's failure to respond to Dr. Kinkeldey's initial message 
indicated its election to contest Iro's position on the Tannert patent. Under these circumstances, I find nothing to suggest that Mr. 
Uddenburg's offer was anything less than a good faith offer to settle the controversy without litigation. Defendants also suggest, though citing no authority, that to resolve this dispute by taking a license would have required that they 
join an illegal conspiracy in violation of the antitrust laws.  (Defendants' Reply Brief, at 6.) I regard this suggestion as specious."
585,6," In view of this finding, I do not address the question, whether, as patent holders the plaintiffs or either of them could refuse to 
grant Roj or Otex licenses under these patents. Cf.  E. Bement & Sons v. National Harrow Co., 186 U.S. 70, 46 L. Ed. 1058, 22 
S. Ct. 747 (1902) (agreement between patent holder and exclusive licensee that any other requests for licenses will be refused 
does not violate antitrust law); United States v. Huck Manufacturing Company, 227 F. Supp. 791, 804 (E.D. Mich. 1964) (patent

F. Supp. 41 (D. Del. 1953); Hercules Powder Co. v. Rohm & Haas Co., 66 F. Supp. 899 (D. Del. 1946). "
588,7," The first substantive paragraph of the amendment states: Wesco agrees that it shall not exercise its right under paragraphs 5.(a) and 5.(b) of the agreement of July 5, 1974, as first 
amended, to convert its exclusive license to a non-exclusive license on the third anniversary (July 5, 1977) and on November 1, 
1977, whereby Wesco shall be obligated to pay minimum royalties for the calendar years 1977 and 1978 in the manner defined 
in paragraphs 4.(a) and 4.(b), respectively, of the agreement of July 5, 1974, as first amended. "

Wesco licensed Roj). "

592,10," Defendants rely primarily on United States v. Singer Manufacturing Company, 374 U.S. 174, 10 L. Ed. 2d 823, 83 S. Ct. 1773 
(1963), as the controlling authority.  I find Singer distinguishable from the instant situation.  In Singer, the actors who joined in a 
conspiracy, were competitors.  As discussed in Part D, supra, Iro and Wesco are not competitors.  In Singer, the Court found 
that there was a conspiracy among the parties.  As I conclude infra, defendants have failed to prove the existence of a 
conspiracy. HN21[
] Conspiratorial cross-licensing and patent pooling by one group of competitors attempting to exclude others go far 
beyond the limited monopoly that a valid patent affords.  See A. Neale & D. Godyer, The Antitrust Laws of the U.S.A.: A Study of 
Competition Enforced By Law 300-02 (3d ed. 1980).  The Supreme Court unequivocally condemned an attempt to abuse patent 
rights in this way in Singer. The Court made clear, however, that its ruling did not preclude a patent holder from the legitimate 
enforcement of his rights under a patent: There is no claim . . . that it is illegal for one merely to acquire a patent in order to 
exclude his competitors; or that the owner of a lawfully acquired patent cannot use the patent laws to exclude all infringers of the 
patent, or that a licensee cannot lawfully acquire the covering patent in order better to enforce it or his own account, even when 
the patent dominates an industry in which the licensee is a dominant firm."
592,374," U.S. at 189. This language is dicta in Singer in the sense that it did not address the actual facts therein.  The language is however pertinent 
to the situation herein, whereas the specific holding of Singer resting on distinguishable facts, is inapposite to this case. "

acquire a license on terms favorable to Mineral Products Corporation and Armstrong.  By contrast, defendants herein refused to 
discuss any licensing agreement under which they would have to pay royalties."
593,13," I note that a comparable standard prevails in conspiracy cases outside the antitrust field.  To show conspiracy, a party must 
produce evidence which is not only consistent with a theory of conspiracy, but evidence which is inconsistent with a theory of 
innocent behavior.  Rutledge v. Electric Hose and Rubber Company, 327 F. Supp. 1267 (C.D. Cal. 1971); Fink v. Sheridan Bank

monopolize, or conspiracy in restraint of trade, and in the course of adjudication analytical focus is placed elsewhere, and in part 
because of conflicting attitudes about policy and the uses of economic concepts in antitrust adjudication."" The most comprehensive discussion of attempts to monopolize is Cooper, Attempts and Monopolization: A Mildly Expansionary 
Answer to the Prophylactic Riddle of Section Two, 72 Mich. L. Rev. 373 (1974). "

stating: Although proof of the defendants' market power may be an alternative to direct evidence of intent to monopolize, it is not 
necessarily an element of an attempt to monopolize.  A showing of anti-competitive acts accompanied by a specific intent to 
monopolize should be sufficient to make out a case of attempt.  See P. Areeda, Antitrust Analysis, 241-49, 258 (2d Ed. 
1974).  430 F. Supp. at 1358 (emphasis in original). In view of the Court of Appeals apparent adherence to the more traditional view that dangerous probability is a necessary 
element of attempt to monopolize, I am not certain that this could be described as the rule of this circuit.  See White Bag Co. v. 
International Paper Co., 579 F.2d 1384, 1387 (4th Cir. 1974). I accept this more liberal standard here for purposes of discussion to make clear that even under this standard, the defendants 
have not made the showing necessary to establish an attempt to monopolize."

] The Newspaper Preservation Act provides: § 1801.  Congressional declaration of policy In the public interest of maintaining a newspaper press editorially and reportorially independent and competitive in all parts 
of the United States, it is hereby declared to be the public policy of the United States to preserve the publication of 
newspapers in any city, community, or metropolitan area where a joint operating arrangement has been heretofore entered 
into because of economic distress or is hereafter effected in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. § 1802.  Definitions As used in this chapter -- (1) The term ""antitrust law"" means the Federal Trade Commission Act and each statute defined by section 4 thereof as 
""Antitrust Acts"" and all amendments to such Act and such statutes and any other Acts in pari materia. (2) The term ""joint newspaper operating arrangement"" means any contract, agreement, joint venture (whether or not 
incorporated), or other arrangement entered into by two or more newspaper owners for the publication of two or more 
newspaper publications, pursuant to which joint or common production facilities are established or operated and joint or 
unified action is taken or agreed to be taken with respect to any one or more of the following: printing; time, method, and 
field of publication; allocation of production facilities; distribution; advertising solicitation; circulation solicitation; business 
department; establishment of advertising rates; establishment of circulation rates and revenue distribution: Provided, That "
602,," there is no merger, combination, or amalgamation of editorial or reportorial staffs, and that editorial policies be 
independently determined. (3) The term ""newspaper owner"" mean[s] any person who owns or controls directly, or indirectly through separate or 
subsidiary corporations, one or more newspaper publications. (4) The term ""newspaper publication"" means a publication produced on newsprint paper which is published in one or more 
issues weekly (including as one publication any daily newspaper and any Sunday newspaper published by the same owner 
in the same city, community, or metropolitan area), and in which a substantial portion of the content is devoted to the 
dissemination of news and editorial opinion. (5) The term ""failing newspaper"" means a newspaper publication which, regardless of its ownership or affiliations, is in 
probable danger of financial failure. (6) The term ""person"" means any individual, and any partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity existing 
under or authorized by the law of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any 
foreign country. § 1803.  Antitrust exemptions (a) It shall not be unlawful under any antitrust law for any person to perform, enforce, renew, or amend any joint 
newspaper operating arrangement entered into prior to July 24, 1970, if at the time at which such arrangement was first 
entered into, regardless of ownership or affiliations, not more than one of the newspaper publications involved in the 
performance of such arrangement was likely to remain or become a financially sound publication: Provided, That the terms 
of a renewal or amendment to a joint operating arrangement must be filed with the Department of Justice and that the 
amendment does not add a newspaper publication or newspaper publications to such arrangement. (b) It shall be unlawful for any person to enter into, perform, or enforce a joint operating arrangement, not already in effect, 
except with the prior written consent of the Attorney General of the United States.  Prior to granting such approval, the 
Attorney General shall determine that not more than one of the newspaper publications involved in the arrangement is a 
publication other than a failing newspaper, and that approval of such arrangement would effectuate the policy and purpose 
of this chapter. (c) Nothing contained in the chapter shall be construed to exempt from any antitrust law any predatory pricing, any 
predatory practice, or any other conduct in the otherwise lawful operations of a joint newspaper operating arrangement 
which would be unlawful under any antitrust law if engaged in by a single entity.  Except as provided in this chapter, no 
joint newspaper operating arrangement or any party thereto shall be exempt from any antitrust law. § 1804.  Reinstatement of joint operating arrangements previously adjudged unlawful under antitrust laws (a) Notwithstanding any final judgment rendered in any action brought by the United States under which a joint operating 
arrangement has been held to be unlawful under any antitrust law, any party to such final judgment may reinstitute said 
joint newspaper operating arrangement to the extent permissible under section 1803(a) of this title. (b) The provisions of section 1803 of this title shall apply to the determination of any civil or criminal action pending in any 
district court of the United State[s] on July 24, 1970, in which it is alleged that any such joint operating agreement is 
unlawful under any antitrust law. HN2[
] "
604,2," The Committee also argues that we should not defer to the Attorney General's interpretation of the Newspaper Preservation 
Act when there has been a prior interpretation inconsistent with his present view of the Act.  See United States v. Leslie Salt Co., 
350 U.S. 383, 396, 100 L. Ed. 441, 451, 76 S. Ct. 416 (1956); Power Brake Company v. United States, 427 F.2d 163, 164 (9th 
Cir. 1970). We agree with that proposition but, as will be discussed below, we do not believe the prior interpretation is 
substantially different from what Attorney General Smith presently believes to be a proper interpretation of the Act. "
606,3," Finding of Fact 158 provides: Considering that the Post-Intelligencer is not, and has not been for sale, and that all inquiries regarding possible purchase 
have been rebuffed by The Hearst Corporation with statements to that effect, and that responsible prospective purchasers 
nevertheless continue to appear and express an interest in buying the Post-Intelligencer, it must be concluded that the 
Post-Intelligencer could in all probability be sold at fair market value to a person or firm who could, and would, continue it in 
operation as an independent metropolitan daily."
606,4," We must emphasize that in this situation our review is of the Attorney General's decision, not the ALJ's.  HN8[
] When the 
agency disagrees with the ALJ, deference still runs in favor of the agency; the ALJ's contrary findings will simply be weighed 
along with the other evidence opposing the agency's decision.  See, e.g., NLRB v. Brooks Cameras, Inc., 691 F.2d 912, 915 (9th 
Cir. 1982). "
607,5," There was evidence of seven purchase inquiries.  Apparently, all the inquiries were by individuals or groups who had the 
potential means to back up any offers they might have made.  Briefly, the nature of these inquiries and Hearst's response were 
as follows: (1) In 1975, a Mr. Bailey asked the P-I's Seattle attorney what the asking price of the P-I was.  The P-I privately advised Mr. 
Bailey that the paper was not for sale. (2) In 1976, Mr. Eller made a similar inquiry and received a similar response. (3) Mr. Cunningham made an inquiry in 1977.  He was also told the paper was not for sale. (4) In 1978, Mr. Guzzo, on behalf of another party, asked Hearst whether the paper was for sale.  Hearst replied it was not. (5) In May of 1981, after the proposed JOA was announced, Mr. Cunningham made another inquiry. While Hearst replied it 
had no present intention of selling, it did state it would carefully consider any responsible bona fide offer.  No offer was ever 
submitted. (6) In October of 1981, Rupert Murdoch stated that if the JOA failed to go through, he would like to be considered as a 
buyer. (7) On November 24, 1981, a Mr. Snellman made it known that he was interested in buying the P-I at a price to be set by 
an appraiser.  This inquiry was made on the last day testimony was to be taken at the hearing and after the close of the 
intervenor's case.  The closing date for the hearing was set for November 28.  The ALJ allowed the letter indicating Mr. 
Snellman's interest into evidence but, due to the last minute nature of the offer and time constraints, did not allow Mr. 
Snellman to testify.  Apparently, Hearst never responded to this late inquiry. Findings of Fact 156 and 157."
607,6," Our review on this point is narrow: Was it proper to reject Finding of Fact 158?  We will discuss in more detail below the 
ramifications of Hearst's failure to hold the paper up for sale and its rebuff of potential buyers. For now, we should note that the 
requirement of attempting to sell the financially distressed company was one of the Citizen Publishing requirements rejected by 
the Newspaper Preservation Act. "
608,7," In reference to the amendment which disjunctively added the danger of probable failure standard to the unlikely to remain 
financially sound definition of a failing paper, the report states: ""This phrase is taken from the Bank Merger Act and has been the 
subject of a Supreme Court opinion in U.S. v. Third National Bank."" Rep. Kastenmeier, in response to the objection that the probable danger standard was loosely drawn, stated: ""The term . . . is 
one that has a legislative history. It comes out of the Bank Merger Act. It is understood by the courts in the field, and happens to 
be a term that is well known."" "
609,8," There are few, if any, things that affect a business's success which can truly be characterized as noneconomic.  A good 
example is the political viewpoint of a publisher.  That viewpoint certainly shows up in the editorial policies of a newspaper. 
Those policies in turn may either attract or reduce readership.  We do not wish to imply that a newspaper must explore the 
alternative of changing its editorial policies prior to entering a JOA.  The Attorney General and Hearst tend to argue that any 
factors extrinsic to the newspaper operation are ""noneconomic."" That, however, is a shortsighted view, and we reject it so far as 
it leads to the conclusion that proof of interested purchasers is ""noneconomic"" and therefore irrelevant under the Act. "
610,9," We note that the Antitrust Division will always be a party when a hearing is held.  Other interested parties may intervene.  28 
C.F.R. § 48.10(b). Also important is the requirement that the applicants for a JOA must provide substantial financial 
documentation concerning their newspapers to the Attorney General.  28 C.F.R. § 48.4.  This information is generally open to 
public view and could be used to rebut an applicant's evidence.  In fact, the intervenors did rely on that information in attacking 
the proposed JOA.  Also, interested buyers could have used this information to come up with a reasonable plan to return the 
paper to profitability."
610,10," The Committee argues that because parties are interested in purchasing the P-I, it cannot actually be failing.  Various bits of 
legislative history are cited in support of this contention.  We disagree, however, with this argument which, in effect, states that a 
newspaper that meets the definition of failing under the Act cannot be sold.  The statements of various congressmen more 
closely relate to the belief that once a newspaper reaches the point of financial difficulty required by Citizen Publishing, the paper 
may very well have little value as an acquisition or as a party in a proposed JOA; it may very well be more advantageous for the 
dominant paper to let the ailing paper die and enjoy the benefits of a natural monopoly rather than entering a joint agreement.  
See, e.g., House of Representatives Hearings before the Antitrust Subcommittee on H.R. 279, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 12 (1969); 
S. Rep. No. 535, supra, at 4; Remarks of Sen. Inouye, 116 Cong. Rec. 1786, Remarks of Rep. Annunzio, Id. at 23,168; cf. 
Remarks of Rep. Feighan, Id. at 23,156 (objects to the Act for the reason it will allow a paper to be considered failing even 
though it could be sold). Also, on December 15, 1982, the Committee requested this court to take judicial notice of the sale of a Hearst newspaper, the 
Boston Herald-American, allegedly in ""probable danger of failure,"" to the News America Publishing Company.  We deny this 
request.  Based on our interpretation of the Act, this sale is not relevant to the determination that the Post-Intelligencer is in 
probable danger of financial failure. "
612,11," The Committee's only support for its position is a statement by Senator Dirksen during the Senate hearings.  Senator 
Dirksen's amendment added the requirement of Attorney General approval for prospective JOA's.  He explained: ""In this way, 
the interest of the suburban papers and the unions will be considered by the Justice Department before any new arrangements 
are authorized."" Senate Hearings before the Antitrust and Monopoly Subcommittee on S. 1520, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 5 (1969).  
Senator Dirksen later explained his intent in proposing this amendment: ""Before authorizing such arrangements in the future, the 
Department could hear from other interested parties -- competing papers, unions, etc. -- as well as make its own investigation, in 
order to be certain the new arrangement is essential and justified."" Id. at 9.  Although Senator Dirksen's statements do not refer 
to the requirement that the JOA ""effectuate the policy and purpose of the Act,"" it is evident he intended primarily to allow 
interested parties a chance to voice their views.  The regulations adopted by the Attorney General permit this and that is what in 
fact happened in the proceedings below. "
613,12," The Committee's primary objection is that the agreement is too long (50 years) and that it will not cease to exist even if the P-I 
becomes profitable in the future. "
621,1, See discussion of trade show monopoly infra. 
630,1," The minutes of the July 24-25, 1980 meeting of the Independent Norelco Distributors Association, Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 1 to 
Watkins deposition, state in relevant part: Presented herein are the highlites (sic) of this meeting by subject category. NEW CONTRACT: The present distributors contract expires on June 30, 1981.  Before the end of the year Paul [Dentone] will deliver a rough draft 
of the proposed new contract which will bear the ""Evergreen"" concept.  That is, it will be based on performance and will have no 
pre-determined expiration date.  It continues idefinitely as long as the sales performance for the designated territory remains at 
quota. The profit margins will be as good or better under the new contract. A recent survey report verified the fact that the distributor/dealer method for marketing dictating machines is the only way (sic) to 
go and therefore, the present Norelco distributors are vital to the success of PBSI.  Paul reinterated (Sic) several times that he is 
personally committed to the success of this business and that the continued relationship with all distributors is essential. The model 585 will be included under the new contract. But no mention of 196 or 640. The rough draft of the contract will be in our hands by January 1, 1981, so that we may review it on an association level, with 
legal council (sic) if necessary, and mutually, make recommendations for change. "
632,2," Wright also stated in his deposition: ""I was kind of in shock because of the way the Mr. Hanrahan and Mr. Fiorie were acting, 
and I think that any game plan that we went in that room with was set aside by their actions"" in response to the question: ""Were 
you interested in questions like [what marketing ideas Hanrahan had to remain profitable]""?  Wright admitted that he already 
intended to buy Audio when he first came into the meeting.  PBSI argues that this statement constitutes a clear admission that 
he changed his mind about buying the company.  However, the meaning of ""game plan"" is ambiguous.  Wright could have been 
referring to his plans for the meeting.  Thus, even ignoring Wright's subsequent declaration purporting to explain what he meant, 
which is not competent evidence, Mesirow at 352, Wright's statement is not dispositive. "

664,1," In addition to Kansas City and MAST, the plaintiffs named as defendants Ambulance Service, Inc. (ASI), the current holder of 
the city's exclusive ambulance license; four individual shareholders of ASI who had consolidated their previously private 
companies; Jack Stout, a consultant who helped develop the city's ambulance system; and Stout's company, Fourth Party, Inc."
664,2," The plaintiffs originally filed their action in state court, alleging only Missouri antitrust law violations and constitutional claims 
under the fourteenth amendment and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Defendant MAST removed the case to federal court, and filed a 
counterclaim alleging that the plaintiffs violated the federal antitrust laws. The plaintiffs then amended their complaint to include 
their Sherman Act claims."
664,3," The appeal is properly before this Court because the district court directed entry of final judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.

666,5," Shortly thereafter, Gold Cross and Transfer filed their action in state court.  After the plaintiffs commenced their lawsuit, no 
further action apparently was taken on the license applications they had pending with MAST."
666,6," Ordinance 53539, of course, requires MAST to contract with a single operator to provide all of Kansas City's ambulance 
service.  In addition, it establishes an Emergency Physicians Advisory Board which appoints an ambulance service Medical 
Director and makes recommendations for the improvement of ambulance service.  The ordinance also gives the city's Director of 
Health authority to promulgate rules, regulations and standards necessary to implement the public utility system.  The Director of 
Health is empowered to establish standards for clinical performance, patient care, response time and medical protocols, and to 
develop procedures for medical control over the delivery of advanced life support by ambulance personnel.  Finally, the 
ordinance requires all ambulance drivers, attendants, and dispatchers to obtain permits from the Director of Health."
666,7," The district court held that because the state action doctrine exempted these four defendants from liability under the federal 
antitrust laws, it also exempted them under Missouri's antitrust statutes.  538 F. Supp. 956, 970 (W.D. Mo. 1982). It held that 
Stout and Fourth Party, Inc., shared the state action exemption of Kansas City and MAST because they did nothing beyond what 
they were authorized to do by the city and MAST.  Id.  at 969-970. The plaintiffs do not challenge either of these conclusions by 
the court below; rather, they contend that it erred in holding that the state action doctrine is applicable here. "
667,8," The Court stated: [The view of the Lafayette plurality that municipal conduct is not exempt unless it is ""pursuant to a state policy to displace 
competition""] was simply a recognition that a State may frequently choose to effect its policies through the instrumentality of 
its cities and towns.  It was stressed, however, that the ""state policy"" relied upon would have to be ""clearly articulated and 
affirmatively expressed."" [435 U.S.] at 410. * * * This standard has since been adopted by a majority of the Court.  New

668,9, Section 67.300 of Missouri Revised Statutes provides:
668,1," .  Any county, city, town or village may provide a general ambulance service for the purpose of transporting sick or injured

with such materials and facilities as are necessary for emergency treatment, and may operate, maintain, repair and replace 
such vehicles, supplies and equipment; (2) Contract with one or more individuals, municipalities, counties, associations or other organizations for the operation,

668,10," Section 190.105.1 requires all ambulance operators to be licensed by the State of Missouri, and Section 190.125 requires an 
annual showing of need for each state ambulance license issued.  Sections 190.115 and 190.120 set out the equipment and the 
kind of insurance coverage which each licensed ambulance must have.  Section 190.145 lists the qualifications which 
ambulance service personnel must meet, and Section 190.175 details the records which each ambulance license holder must 
maintain. "
669,11," The plaintiffs contend that state authorization or contemplation of municipal action is insufficient to satisfy the state action 
doctrine; rather, they apparently suggest that the state must compel or command the city's action.  We disagree.  Accord Town 
of Hallie v. City of Eau Claire, 1983-1 Trade Cases para. 65,227, at 69,337 (7th Cir. Feb. 17, 1983). In Community Communications, Inc. v. City of Boulder, 455 U.S. 40, 54-57, 70 L. Ed. 2d 810, 102 S. Ct. 835 (1982), the 
Supreme Court did not require state compulsion of the city's conduct as a prerequisite to state action immunity.  In fact, the 
Community Communications Court, id. at 55-56, repeated with approval the language regarding state authorization or 
contemplation of the challenged restraint used by the plurality in City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 
55 L. Ed. 2d 364, 98 S. Ct. 1123 (1978). See Areeda, Antitrust Law Para. 212.5, at 59-61 (1982 Supp.) (concluding that state 
need not compel the challenged restraint as a prerequisite to application of the Parker doctrine to municipal conduct). In fact, the Supreme Court has used language demanding state compulsion only in cases involving private defendants.  E.g., 
Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 579, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141, 96 S. Ct. 3110 (1976); Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 
773, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572, 95 S. Ct. 2004 (1975). In any event, in its most recent case involving private conduct, the Supreme Court 
required, as prerequisites for Parker immunity, a state policy to displace competition and active state supervision rather than 
state compulsion of the challenged practice.  California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 105, 
63 L. Ed. 2d 233, 100 S. Ct. 937 (1980). "
670,12," The Supreme Court stated: Nor can those actions [by the city] be truly described as ""comprehended within the powers granted,"" since the term, 
""granted,"" necessarily implies an affirmative addressing of the subject by the State.  The State did not do so here: The 
relationship of the State of Colorado to Boulder's moratorium ordinance is one of precise neutrality.  As the majority in the 
Court of Appeals below acknowledged: ""We are here concerned with City action in the absence of any regulation whatever 
by the State of Colorado.  Under these circumstances there is no interaction of state and local regulation. We have only the 
action or exercise of authority by the City."" Community Communications Co. v. City of Boulder, supra, 455 U.S. at 56 (citation omitted) (emphasis included)."
670,13," The provision of ambulance service by Kansas City is a traditional governmental function designed to protect public health and 
safety.  See Note, The Supreme Court, 1981 Term, 96 Harv. L. Rev. 268-278 (1982).  We need not address the question of 
whether municipal conduct which is outside the scope of such a traditional governmental function and which may pose a more 
significant threat to competition may require active state supervision to qualify for protection under the Parker doctrine.  Id. "
671,14," Because the majority in Community Communications, Inc. v. City of Boulder, supra, found that the challenged restraint was 
not in furtherance of a clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy, it explicitly declined to determine whether the 
""active state supervision"" requirement applied to municipal conduct.  455 U.S. at 51 n.14."
671,15," In any event, the district court's finding that adequate state supervision of Kansas City's ambulance system existed here was 
not clearly erroneous."
671,16," Because we hold that the state action doctrine shields these defendants from antitrust liability, we need not address the issue 
of whether the plaintiffs' Sherman Act claims against them are barred by the tenth amendment to the United States Constitution."
671,17," The plaintiffs do not appeal from the district court's finding that they were not denied equal protection under the fourteenth 
amendment. "
673,18," To the extent that the district court's opinion suggests that a legitimate claim of entitlement can never arise from the 
procedures established in the statutes or regulations adopted by a state or its subdivisions, we disagree.  See, e.g., Wilson v. 
Robinson, 668 F.2d 380, 382-383 (8th Cir. 1981) (county ordinance requiring two weeks notice prior to the termination of 
nonprobationary sheriff's deputies creates a property interest protectable under the fourteenth amendment).  We hold only that 
in this case, Gold Cross and Transfer have failed to demonstrate that there are any Missouri or Kansas City statutes or 
regulations, or alternatively any agreement between the various parties, which gave the plaintiffs a legitimate claim of entitlement 
to a municipal ambulance license. "
676,1, Plaintiff's cross-motion is limited to two of its causes of action.
676,2," In addition to this action, there is a parallel state court action alleging common law claims brought by the plaintiff against the 
same defendants."
676,3," N.V. Philips was named as a defendant in this action but was dismissed from the action in February 1982 due to plaintiff's 
failure to prosecute. "
677,4," At one point, a New Jersey corporation called MLC, Inc. was formed by Fitzsimmons's brother, Cornelius, apparently to 
distribute the cards. Its business and purpose is not known to this Court.  However, both the Fitzsimmons brothers are in 
litigation against the defendants in this Court and in the Eastern District of New York."
677,5," Mr. Fitzsimmons explains his giving of this exclusive distributorship to his friend in the following words: ""At that time our data 
system division was a young struggling accounting machine business and mlcs were a collateral business which I found was 
better handled by MLC Inc. and Thomas J. Donaghy."" Affidavit of John J. Fitzsimmons at 3."
677,6," One way of achieving this was by initiating a new service policy in April 1972, informing users of Philips machines (as well as 
its salesmen) that the manufacturer's warranty and customer service contracts would not be honored should the customer 
employ cards bought from anyone other than an ""authorized distributor."""
677,7," The mlc's were not usually sold directly to the customer, but rather to independent printers, who would print graphics, columnar 
headings, and other markings on the cards, pursuant to the orders of the users. "
678,8," These advantages, as outlined in a memorandum of December 23, 1974, were as follows: (1) Although Philips had a 
responsibility to its customers, it had no legal protection from MLC in its relationship with it, so that while MLC could make all of 
the profit, it had no obligations; (2) as the responsible party, Philips was entitled to the profits; and (3) there would be indirect 
benefits in customer contact which could result in future hardware sales."
678,9," One of the alleged tactics objected to by plaintiff was defendants' purported request that JK demand that MLC place a very 
large order (ten times its usual size), which created the need for the financial guarantees sought from PBSI."
678,10," This included an agreement for consulting services by Donaghy, which appear to be primarily a tax gimmick."
678,11," Nevertheless, the terms on which the acquisition was ultimately consummated were reasonably close to those which had been 
proposed by plaintiff's counsel at the beginning of its five-month negotiation with the defendants. "
679,12," These memoranda became available through inadvertence in a companion action, General Business Systems v. North 
American Philips Corp., 699 F. 2d 965 (9th Cir. 1983), which will be discussed hereafter."
679,13," Plaintiff contends that defendants' gross sales are the measure of damages, since, purportedly, it would have had no costs 
whatsoever in selling the cards. "
680,14," General Business Systems (""GBS"") had been a Philips distributor for Northern California since 1972.  It had agreed not to 
market competitive hardware.  (Its area of operations was extended to St. Louis, Missouri, in 1974.) In 1978, Philips exercised a 
buy-out option, terminating the agency relationship. In 1974, GBS contacted the German manufacturers and attempted to purchase the cards directly.  One of the companies 
refused to deal with GBS, believing that it (the card manufacturer) had an exclusive dealing relationship with Philips.  The other 
company, however, in 1976, began sales to GBS. The litigation also concerned a counterclaim by Philips against GBS for dealing with a competing computer manufacturer."
680,15, The original complaint in this action was modeled on the General Business Systems complaint. 
682,16," See supra note 2. As we noted earlier, plaintiff, as a sole vendor and distributor, would have been considered a monopolist were the magnetic 
ledger cards for Philips computers a relevant market. Consequently, in talking about unfair competition, plaintiff is not seeking to 
protect competition per se, but rather to protect its own position."
682,17," This is a much criticized opinion.  See, e.g., Handler, Reforming the Antitrust Laws, 82 Colum. L. Rev. 1287, 1299-1307 
(1982). "
683,18, This contention flies in the face of the fact that defendants were actually hurt by the cost of their cards rather than helped. 
684,19," Professor Handler argues that ""[i]n sum, the anticompetitive consequences that flow from exclusive representation 
agreements are not so pernicious as to require or justify the application of a per se rule of illegality either at common law or 
under federal antitrust law."" Handler & Lazaroff, Restraint of Trade and the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, 57 N.Y.U. L. 
Rev. 669, 712."
684,20," The court's actual statement was ""Oreck was required to show not only conspiratorial conduct by Sears and Whirlpool in order to recover under § 1 of the 
Sherman Act but also credible proof that the net result and effect of the allegedly conspiratorial conduct of the defendants was 
anticompetitve in the vacuum cleaner industry as a whole or that the conspiracy was designed to drive Oreck out of the vacuum 
cleaner business. "" Oreck Corp. v. Whirlpool Corp., supra, 563 F. 2d at 58 (emphasis added). "
685,21," The court did, however, indirectly recognize the possibility of pressure to prevent dealing within the United States market.  
General Business Systems, supra, 699 F. 2d at 979."
685,22," On the other hand, defendants have introduced evidence that their specifications for the manufacture of the cards had a 
legend in German which stated as follows: ""All rights expressly reserved.  Reproduction or disclosure to third parties in whatever 
form is forbidden without the written consent of the owner."" Affidavit of Thomas W. Dickson at 2.  Defendants have also offered 
evidence suggesting that the exclusive distributorship arrangement existed as early as 1969."
685,23," Under such a conclusion, plaintiff may still have some remedy against defendants, but it does not sound in antitrust."
685,24," The section 7 claim must fail because the relevant product market does not consist of mlc's, so that there could be no 
substantial lessening of competition in the relevant market by the acquisition of the card distributorship. Cf.  United States v. 
General Dynamics Corp., 415 U.S. 486 (1974) (coal producer found not to have violated section 7 of the Clayton Act because "
686,," Government's evidence did not support contention that acquisition of another coal producer substantially lessened competition in 
the production and sale of coal in either or both of two specified geographic markets). "
694,1," Pursuant to the Agreement, NOBS will first merge into NOBS Financial Corporation, all of the stock of which will be owned by 
BNO (the ""preliminary merger"").  As a result of this preliminary merger, shareholders of NOBS will become shareholders of BNO 
and NOBS will cease to exist.  At this point in the reorganization BNO stock will no longer be owned by NOBS or by any other 
bank holding company.  BNO, which after the preliminary merger will be a publicly held state banking association, will then 
merge into FNBC, a national banking association, and the separate existence of BNO will cease pursuant to 12 U.S.C.  § 
215a(e).  Thus, prior to the time of the merger challenged herein, BNO will be a separate and independent state bank, 
unaffiliated with any bank holding company. "
695,2," It should be noted by way of background that in early March 1983, Mr. Koerner, acting as counsel for Aiken, submitted a 
comment to the OCC opposing the approval of the application to merge on the grounds that the merger was violative of Section 
7 of the Clayton Act and Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. As recently as March 20, 1983, Mr. Koerner filed additional 
comments in opposition to the merger with the OCC urging alleged violation of federal antitrust law and state laws.  It is not 
clear whether Mr. Koerner was representing himself or either Aiken or Vial in connection with the submission to the OCC, since 
the most recent submission occurred inter-plaintiff, as it were. "
698,3," Plaintiff's actions reveal that while masquerading as a state antitrust claimant, he is in reality pursuing a federal remedy, 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C.  § 705. He was not content to rely solely upon his state court antitrust proceeding and his state action 
directed against Commissioner Wagner.  He also felt compelled to seek injunctive (and other) relief against the OCC, admittedly 
a proceeding involving a federal question. This tactic, in itself, results in a tacit admission of the involvement of a federal 
question, since it demonstrates that these actions are totally interrelated, raise identical issues, arise out of the same operative 
facts, and seek the same ultimate relief. "
699,4," Neither the Comptroller nor the Commissioner objects to this consolidation, though plaintiff does.  HN17[
]"
699,5," However, HN18[
] the fact ""that there are some questions not common to all the actions [does not bar consolidation] so long 
as there is at least one common question."" 9 Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, § 2384 at 267-69 (1971); 
Central Motor Co. v. United States, 583 F.2d 470 (10th Cir. 1978) Jordan v. Jones, 563 F.2d 148 (5th Cir. 1977); Botazzi v. 
Petroleum Helicopters, Inc., 664 F.2d 49 (5th Cir. 1981). "
708,1," An unspoken premise of this argument is that Crawford took some action to force both Capital and Read to cooperate in this 
scheme, since, as a practical matter, Gibbons did not compete with either Capital or Read.  We need not dwell on the validity of 
this premise, however, given our disposition on the lack of damage. "
710,2," In Malcolm, we held that the plaintiff in a refusal to deal case is not required to show a lack of alternative supply.  Thus, it may 
well be Crawford's burden to disprove the reasonableness of this cost."
710,3," From June 1978 to October 31, 1978, Gibbons placed $207,330.80 worth of orders with Potomac.  Pemberton's commission 
would have been $3,110. The total cost of these same products through Capital would have been $212,699.56.  Invoicing 
through Potomac was $2,253.76 cheaper overall.  From November 1, 1978 to February 28, 1979, Potomac invoiced 
$149,869.25 to Gibbons.  Pemberton's commission would have been $2,248.  The cost of the same goods from Capital was 
$152,617.99.  Purchasing through Potomac for this period therefore saved Gibbons approximately $500. We also note that for some periods, Pemberton's commission was only 1%.  Thus, the difference in cost between Capital and 
Potomac would be even greater."

712,5, We note that there is no evidence in the record of any anti-competitive activity's effect on Hydrasun's business. 
713,6," Indeed, it was clear from the facts of Greene that a ""meaningful event"" did occur when the distributor ceased to comply -- 
namely, General Foods terminated Greene's distributorship. Gibbons also advances United States v. Bausch & Lomb Optical Co., 321 U.S. 707, 64 S. Ct. 805, 88 L. Ed. 1024 (1944) as 
support for its contention. Yet the Court there noted specifically that material deviations from the manufacturer's resale price 
would result in termination of the wholesaler's franchise.  Id. at 719-20, 64 S. Ct. at 811-12. "
716,7," We note that the district court's description of the issue comported with defendant's contention on appeal.  There is no 
indication from reading the instruction that full disclosure equaled good faith.  For example, Judge Palmieri said: I also told you that you could find that there was full disclosure by the Keeneys if there was a conscientious attempt by them 
to tell their attorneys . . . whatever they knew about the case, whether the Keeneys acted in good faith for the purpose of 
seeking guidance from the attorneys, and whether they made a full and complete report to them are questions for you to 
determine."
716,8," Defendants rely upon the following section of Judge Palmieri's discussion: The problem as I see it is for you to determine whether in making this disclosure to the attorneys they were setting in 
motion a series of legal events which added up to a legal process that was all done for a collateral and ulterior purpose. If that was done for that purpose, if this was all set in motion for the purpose of coercing the defendants to make a 
distributorship arrangement, with Gibbons, then it would be a bad motive; it would not be good faith. If, on the other hand, the full disclosure was made to the attorneys, irrespective of any such motivation, and solely for the 
purpose of vindicating the rights which they had based upon that full disclosure, then there would not be any question of 
bad faith or the absence of good faith. . . .  (Emphasis ours)"
716,9," Judge Palmieri in discussing this issue with counsel said: if they [the Keeneys] put facts before the attorneys but really not intending to do anything except to force these defendants 
into giving them a distributorship, they were not seeking advice in good faith; they were seeking to abuse legal process for 
an ulterior purpose. This indicates that Judge Palmieri did not, at least at this point, equate good faith and full disclosure. "
717,10," Defendants also assert that, the district court should have granted judgment n.o.v. on this issue.  We think that, applying the 
Boeing standard, reasonable men could reach different conclusions regarding the motives of the Keeneys in bringing this 
lawsuit.  While there was much evidence that the Keeneys brought this suit to extort a distributorship, the Keeneys testified to 
the contrary.  Such credibility choices are traditionally the province of the jury.  Doucet v. Diamond M. Drilling Co., 683 F.2d 
886, 889, n.2 (5th Cir.1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1127, 103 S. Ct. 1234, 75 L. Ed. 2d 468 (1983)."
717,11," The district court made clear in no uncertain terms that Gibbons' counsel had overstepped the bounds of proper closing 
argument.  The court stated: At times, counsel for plaintiff presented arguments and made references to defendants based on facts wholly unsupported 
by the record and unduly inflammatory in nature . . . Plaintiff's counsel repeatedly characterized defendants . . . in a manner 
prejudicial to defendants.  Defendants were repeatedly referred to, explicitly and implicitly, in terms denoting unsavory and 
illegal characteristics . . . . "
728,1," See, e.g., Miree v. DeKalb County, 433 U.S. 25, 27, 53 L. Ed. 2d 557, 97 S. Ct. 2490 n.2 (1977); Rogin v. Bensalem Township, 
616 F.2d 680, 685 (3d Cir. 1980); Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp., 561 F.2d 434, 444 (3d Cir. 1977)."
728,2," Muir was a limited partnership which, according to the complaint, went into receivership in August of 1981.  Amended 
Complaint para. 5."
728,3," During the period involved, from the summer of 1978 until 1981, Peterson and his associate Nancy Rochford, regularly 
entertained Dr. and Mrs. Kimmel to further cement their relationship of trust. "
729,4, Defendants' had also convinced the Kimmels to make their children subordinated creditors of Muir as well. 
730,5," The Ninth Circuit eschewed an overly stringent reading of Rule 9(b) and expressed a similar concern over losing sight of the 
liberality of the pleading rules.  In Gottreich, 552 F.2d 866 (9th Cir. 1977) the court stated: Defendants say that an allegation that they knew that the representations were false is not the equivalent of an allegation 
that they were false.  How could defendants know that they were false if they were not false? We had thought that this kind 
of nit-picking had disappeared in 1938, when the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were first adopted."
730,552," F.2d at 867. Although I do not mean to suggest that defendants' contentions are along the same vein, the expressed 
concern over the Federal Rules is applicable to this case. "
731,6," Of the courts of appeal to address the issue, four have implied a private right of action, see Stephenson v. Calpine Conifers II, 
Ltd., 652 F.2d 808, 815 (9th Cir. 1981); Lincoln National Bank v. Herber, 604 F.2d 1038, 1040 n.2 (7th Cir. 1979); Kirshner v. 
United States, 603 F.2d 234, 241 (2d Cir. 1978); cert. denied, sub nom., Goldberg v. Kirshner, 444 U.S. 995, 62 L. Ed. 2d 
426, 100 S. Ct. 531 (1979); Newman v. Prior, 518 F.2d 97, 99 (4th Cir. 1975); two have refused to so do, see Landry v. All 
American Assurance Co., 688 F.2d 381, 391 (5th Cir. 1982); Shull v. Dain, Kalman & Quail, Inc., 561 F.2d 152, 159 (8th Cir. 
1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1086, 55 L. Ed. 2d 792, 98 S. Ct. 1281 (1978) and one appears undecided, leaning slightly toward 
joining the majority, see Gutter v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 644 F.2d 1194, 1196 (6th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 
455 U.S. 909, 71 L. Ed. 2d 447, 102 S. Ct. 1256 (1982). However, the implied right of action under § 17(a) has not fared as well 
on the district court level.  See, e.g., Hill v. Der, 521 F. Supp. 1370, 1378 (D. Del. 1981); Ingram Industries v. Nowicki, 502 F. 
Supp. 1060, 1069 (E.D. Ky. 1980); McFarland v. Memorex Corp., 493 F. Supp. 631, 652 (N.D. Cal. 1980); Martin v. Howard, 
Weil, Labouisse, Friedricks, Inc., 487 F. Supp. 503, 507 (E.D. La. 1980); Reid v. Mann, 381 F. Supp. 525, 528 (N.D. Ill. 1974); 
Dyer v. Eastern Trust & Banking Co., 336 F. Supp. 890, 903 (D. Me. 1971). But see, Campito v. McManus, Longe, Brockwehl, 
Inc., 470 F. Supp. 986, 993 (N.D.N.Y. 1979); DeMarco v. Security Planning Service, Inc., 462 F. Supp. 1066, 1069 (D. Ariz. 
1978); In re Gap Stores Securities Litigation, 457 F. Supp. 1135, 1142 (N.D. Cal. 1978). In this district a private right of action 
has been implied.  See, e.g., Engl v. Berg, 511 F. Supp. 1146, 1151-52 (E.D. Pa. 1981); Wulc v. Gulf & Western, Ind., 400 F. 
Supp. 99, 103 (E.D. Pa. 1975); B & B Investment Club v. Kleinert's, Inc., 391 F. Supp. 720, 726 (E.D. Pa. 1975). See also Mifflin 
Energy Sources Inc. v. Brooks, 501 F. Supp. 334, 336-37 (W.D. Pa. 1980)."
731,7," The trend away from implying private remedies can be witnessed outside the securities area.  See, e.g., Middlesex County 
Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Ass'n, 453 U.S. 1, 69 L. Ed. 2d 435, 101 S. Ct. 2615 (1981); California v. Sierra 
Club, 451 U.S. 287, 68 L. Ed. 2d 101, 101 S. Ct. 1775 (1981); Universities Research Ass'n, Inc. v. Coutu, 450 U.S. 754, 67 L. 
Ed. 2d 662, 101 S. Ct. 1451 (1981). "
732,8," For example, sections 11 and 12 of the 1933 Act are subject to the statute of limitations contained in section 13.  As an implied 
cause of action, there is no statutory statute of limitations for actions brought under section 10(b).  The most nearly analogous 
state statute applies, which is often longer than the period found in section 13."
732,9," HN8[
] By its very language, section 17(a) is broader than section 10(b), as it encompasses fraud in the ""offer"" or ""sale"" of 
securities, rather than just fraud in the purchase or sale."
732,10," In Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U.S. 375, 103 S. Ct. 683, 74 L. Ed. 2d 548, 51 U.S.L.W. 4099 (1983) the Supreme 
Court reiterated the logic employed in Ernst & Ernst. The coverage of section 10(b), because of its broad language, necessarily 
overlaps with some of the express remedies granted in the Securities Act of 1933, specifically section 11.  Section 11, which can 
be triggered by negligent conduct, has certain procedural safeguards, such as a set statute of limitations and a bond for costs 
provision.  Section 10(b) lacks these procedural obstacles.  Thus, were 10(b) to cover negligent actions, section 11 and its 
procedures would be rendered superfluous, ""thereby nullify[ing] the effectiveness of the carefully drawn procedural restrictions 
on these express actions."" Herman, 51 U.S.L.W. at 4102, (quoting Ernst and Ernst, 425 U.S. at 210). This statutory analysis is 
applicable to section 17(a) as well. "
733,11," Many lower courts have developed interesting solutions to this perceived procedural escapism.  See, e.g., Feldman v. Simkins 
Industries, Inc., 679 F.2d 1299, 1305 (9th Cir. 1982) (under section 17(a)) must prove scienter or a duty to disclose non-public 
information); Collins v. Signetics Corp., 443 F. Supp. 552, 555 (E.D. Pa. 1977) (implied right of action under section 17(a) 
subject to limitations found in section 12(2) of the 1933 Act). "
734,12," In Landry, the Fifth Circuit found the first prong of Cort wanting, as ""the statutory language does not suggest a private cause of 
action."" 688 F.2d at 389. The provision is only ""a general censure of fraudulent practices."" Id. This argument is specious.  A 
statute which lacks an express cause of action will rarely have language which ""suggests a private cause of action."" That the 
provision is a general proscription does not impact upon whether it was intended to protect a certain group of people.  The mere 
fact that someone can be enjoined or criminally punished under section 17(a) inures to the benefit of potential victims.  Finally, 
this conclusion ignores the Supreme Court's ruling to the contrary in Naftalin."
734,13," Section 13 is the statute of limitations section that applies to sections 11 and 12.  See note 8 supra. Professor Loss notes that 
to allow an implied cause of action 17(a) would be ""to attribute to Congress the rather elaborate intention that a purchaser may 
avoid the statute of limitations prescribed in § 13, as well as the possibility of having to post security for costs and perhaps the 
necessity of proving his own lack of knowledge of the falsity as in § 12(2) . . ."" 3 L. Loss, Securities Regulation at 1786 (2d ed. 
1961) [hereinafter cited as Loss]."
734,14," While discussing the propriety of implying a private remedy under section 10(b), Professor Loss explained the interrelationship 
of all of the statutory provisions: The question is simply whether there is the same justification for implying such liability under the 1933 act as there is under 
the 1934 act.  It is one thing to imply a private right of action under § 10(b) or the other provisions of the 1934 act, because 
the specific liabilities created by §§ 9(e), 16(b) and 18 do not cover all the variegated activities with which that act is 
concerned.  But it is quite another thing to add an implied remedy under § 17(a) of the 1933 act to the detailed remedies "
735,," specifically created by §§ 11 and 12.  The 1933 act is a much narrower statute.  It deals only with disclosure and fraud in 
the sale of securities. It has but two important substantive provisions, §§ 5 and 17(a).  Non-compliance with § 5 results in 
civil liability under § 12(1).  Faulty compliance results in liability under § 11 and § 17(a) has its counterpart in § 12(2).  It all 
makes a rather neat pattern.  Within the area of §§ 5 and 17(a), §§ 11 and 12 (unlike §§ 9(e), 16(b) and 18 of the 1934 act) 
are all embracing.  This is not to say that the remedies afforded by §§ 11 and 12 are complete.  But the very restrictions 
contained in those sections and the differences between them -- for example, the fact that § 11 but not § 12 imposes 
liability on certain persons connected with the issuer without regard to their participation in the offering and the fact that § 
12(2) does not go so far in relation to § 17(a) and § 12(1) goes in relation to § 5 -- make it seem the less justifiable to permit 
plaintiffs to circumvent the limitations of § 12 by resort to § 17(a).  Particularly is this so in view of the fact that § 11, 
together with the statute of limitations in § 13, was actually tightened in the 1934 amendments to the Securities Act. Loss at 1785."
735,15," Many of the same arguments could be made as regards the implication of a private right under section 10(b).  The arguments 
would not be as persuasive, however.  As Professor Loss pointed out, the express remedies in the 1934 Act are not as broad as 
in the 1933 Act.  See note 14 supra. Thus, there is arguably more need for a private action under section 10(b).  The fact that a 
private right of action has been implied thereunder is not a determining factor.  As noted earlier, the section 10(b) right of action 
was essentially thrust on the Supreme Court, which like many of the lower federal courts, accepted its existence without much 
analysis.  See Redington, 442 U.S. at 577-78 n. 19; Hill v. Der, 521 F. Supp. at 1378 n.4. "
736,16," The infiltration of organized crime into legitimate business was isolated by the Kefauver Committee as early as 1951.  The 
McClellan Committee documented the infiltration of labor unions and the existence of ""La Cosa Nostra."" The problem was also 
studied in 1967 by the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice.  See generally, Blakey & 
Gettings, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO): Basic Concepts -- Criminal and Civil Remedies, 53 Temp. 
L.Q. 1009, 1014-15 (1980). For an exhaustive legislative history of RICO, see Blakey, The RICO Civil Fraud Action in Context: 
Reflections on Burnett v. Berg, 58 Notre Dame L. Rev. 237, 249-80 (1982). [Hereinafter cited as Blakey]. "
738,17," Criminal decisions on this issue should have the same precedential import as civil rulings.  See Eaby, et al. v. Richmond, et 
al., 561 F. Supp. 131, slip op. at 4-5 (E.D. Pa. 1983).  If a court is amenable to extending criminal sanctions to those not linked 
with organized crime, no sound reason exists for not extending civil liability."
738,18," The Bar Association Report stated: On the one hand, the crimes listed as ""racketeering activity"" include several categories which are plainly beyond the 
intention of the Senate Committee, as expressed in the Report, and which should not, in our view, be subjected to the 
severe penalties of Title IX.  The Senate Report states: ""'Racketeering activity' is defined in terms of specific State and 
Federal criminal statutes now characteristically violated by members of organized crime."" Senate Report 34.  This 
statement is not supported, however, by the language of the statute, which includes as racketeering activity such things as 
theft from an interstate shipment regardless of the value of the property stolen (18 U.S.C. § 659), unlawful use of a stolen 
telephone credit card (18 U.S.C. § 1343), the ""mom and pop"" variety of illegal gambling business which, as we point out "
739,," above, would be covered by Title VIII (proposed 18 U.S.C. § 1955), any securities fraud case, and virtually any state felony 
or federal misdemeanor involving drugs -- which would clearly include marijuana violations."
739,19," Commenting on the New York Bar Association's objections, Professor Blakey noted that: Despite this testimony, Title IX was not only reported out, but the treble damage clause was added. Accordingly, those who 
seek to have the courts restrict the scope of the statute to curtail its application to fraud are refighting in the judicial forum a 
battle they lost in the legislative arena . . . . Blakey, supra note 16, at 273 n. 112.  (Emphasis in original)."
739,20," Senator McClellan, in explaining that RICO attempts to proscribe the type of crimes often committed by organized crime, 
praised their ingenuity: Members of La Cosa Nostra and smaller organized crime groups are sufficiently resourceful and enterprising that one 
constantly is surprised by the variety of offenses that they commit.  It is impossible to draw an effective statute which 
reaches most of the commercial activities of organized crime, yet does not include offenses commonly committed by 
persons outside organized crime as well. "
740,116," Cong. Rec. at 18,940 (June 9, 1970)."
740,21," The requirement of a commercial or competitive injury, like the necessity of proving a link to organized crime, may be reflective 
of judicial discomfort with the broad sweep of RICO.  Indeed, the statute federalizes many state offenses and provides 
supplemental remedies in areas where remedies already exist.  The Harper court expressed this sentiment by noting that ""it is 
simply incomprehensible that a plaintiff suing under the securities laws would receive one-third the damages of a plaintiff suing 
under RICO for the same injury."" 545 F. Supp. at 1007-08. Although a valid concern, it is one which is within the province of 
Congress.  It is not the place of the judiciary to narrow a purposely broad statute by judicial fiat.  As Professor Blakey 
commented, ""the blunt truth is that some lower courts have been more intent on redrafting than reading RICO."" Blakey, supra 
note 16, at 285. "
741,22," This similarity in language was a result of a suggestion made by the American Bar Association.  Hearings on S.30, 91st Cong., 
2d Sess. at 543-44 (1970) (testimony of Edward Wright, President Elect of the American Bar Association). "
742,23," Plaintiffs pose the following rhetorical question; ""who would have standing to sue a group of racketeers who are engaged in a 
pattern of arson fraud?  The gangster's competitors?"" Brief in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 26."
742,24," The court defined HN23[
] the enterprise as ""an entity, for present purposes a group of persons associated together for a 
common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct."" 452 U.S. at 583. The pattern of racketeering ""is, on the other hand, a 
series of criminal acts as defined by the statute."" Id."
742,25," HN24[
] Enterprise is defined as ""any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity."" 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4).  Thus an enterprise can either be a legal 
entity or an association of some form.  See Bennett v. Berg, 685 F.2d 1053, 1060 & 1060 n. 9 (8th Cir. 1982). "
743,26," The Bennett court noted that an entity is more likely to be deemed an ""enterprise"" distinct from acts of racketeering when it is a 
creation of the law.  685 F.2d at 1060-61 and 1060 n. 9."
743,27," The court in Lemm held that a RICO enterprise must meet three tests: (1) a shared purpose; (2) continuity of personnel and 
(3) a structure distinct from the pattern.  680 F.2d at 1198. The defendants, as affiliates of Muir had a shared purpose to defraud 
plaintiff.  The continuity of personnel and requisite structure are also present."
743,28," Plaintiffs' only rebuttal to this argument is the assertion that a claim was stated and the suggestion that the appropriate remedy 
is requiring a more specific pleading, rather than dismissal. "
745,29," In his motion to dismiss, defendant Mario Andretti also notes that Count XI should be dismissed, as his failure to correct Mr. 
Peterson as to his status as a limited, rather than general partner in Muir fails to state a cause of action for intentional infliction. 
For all of the reasons stated above, I agree.  Mr. Andretti's conduct is simply not ""outrageous,"" as that term has been defined 
under Pennsylvania law.  Count XI shall be dismissed against all defendants. "
746,30," Defendant argues that since Kimmel had to sign the partnership agreement before becoming a partner and since that 
agreement listed Andretti as a limited partner, Kimmel had notice and no fraud occurred.  Were I to rest my decision on the 
partnership agreement submitted by Andretti, I would probably agree.  This impacts upon the materiality of the 
misrepresentation. While it is dubious in the abstract, whether Andretti's misrepresentation would be material to Kimmel's 
decision to become a limited partner in Muir, knowledge would certainly defeat materiality.  I note that it is not clear that Andretti 
had a duty to correct Dirks' misstatement. "
750,1," In Hanover the Supreme Court held that plaintiffs, HN1[
] direct purchasers-retailers, of defendants' goods were entitled to 
their entire damages, even though all or part of those damages may have been passed on to the plaintiffs' customers.  The case 
established the rule that a defendant may not use a ""defensive pass-on theory."" In Illinois Brick the Court again confronted the 
question of whether the overcharged direct purchaser should be deemed to have suffered the full injury from the alleged 
wholesale overcharge; but the issue was presented in the context of a suit by an indirect purchaser seeking to show its injury by 
establishing pass on by the direct purchaser. The Court held that, in keeping with Hanover, HN2[
] a pass on theory may not 
be used offensively by an indirect purchaser. Indirect purchasers would be denied the right to recover for unlawful overcharges 
by manufacturers which were passed on to the plaintiff-indirect purchasers by retailers. "
757,*," Judge Sprecher was originally the third member of the panel, but his untimely death prevented his participation in the decision 
of this case. Judge Posner took his place and read the briefs and pertinent portions of the record and listened to the tape 
recording of the oral argument. "
766,1," The ""minimum aggregate compensation"" fee sets forth the total amount the networks must pay to the individual schools for the 
rights to particular games. If at the end of the season the minimum has not been paid, the balance is paid to the NCAA."
766,2," A minor deviation from this rule is the ""exception telecast."" Essentially, games that qualify as exception telecasts are those (1) 
that are sold out or are being played more than 400 miles from the area in which the game is to be telecast, and (2) that will not 
be telecast within a certain distance of other football games unless those games are sold out. These telecasts occur infrequently 
and do not affect our analysis of the television plan and network contracts."
766,3," Although the boycott claim presents a double contingency -- the plaintiffs must sell broadcast rights in violation of the television 
plan and the NCAA must boycott the plaintiffs -- the claim is ripe.  The plaintiffs have adequately evidenced their desire to be 
free of the restrictions; indeed, Oklahoma executed a contract for the broadcast of its games. Also, the NCAA has publicly 
threatened to sanction institutions that violate its television plan.  See 546 F. Supp. at 1286, 1302. "
767,4," Brunswick does not mandate the result sought by the NCAA for another reason.  In Brunswick a vertical merger prevented 
Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc. from reaping profits that would have accompanied an increase in market concentration.  Pueblo sued 
for those profits, alleging that the merger was unlawful.  The Court denied recovery, stating that the lost profits Pueblo would 
have derived from a decrease in competition were not injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent.  429 U.S. at 
489. Here, the plaintiffs seek the right to compete in a market free from artificial restrictions. "
768,5," Because the networks possess exclusive rights to negotiate with the schools, the establishment of the minimum fee ensures 
that the schools will receive a ""reasonable"" payment for the broadcast rights.  However, the fee also eliminates any incentive on 
the part of the networks to reward games of greater merit with higher payments.  This effect does not necessarily reflect 
anticompetitive price enhancement (price fixing/allocative inefficiency in the economic sense), but it does reflect a distortion of 
free market forces."
768,6," The United States' amicus brief suggests that because the trial court scrutinized the procompetitive justifications proffered by 
the NCAA, it employed a form of rule of reason analysis.  The brief argues that it is improper to characterize a case as ""per se"" 
after assessing and rejecting proffered justifications.  Broadcast Music holds otherwise.  Permitting facial consideration of 
attempts to justify restraints accompanying partial integrations does no violence to the concept of per se rules.  Essentially, per 
se rules were developed in the interest of litigation efficiency. ""Per se rules always contain a degree of arbitrariness.  They are justified on the assumption that the gains from imposition 
of the rule will far outweigh the losses and that significant administrative advantages will result.  In other words, the 
potential competitive harm plus the administrative costs of determining in what particular situations the practice may be 
harmful must far outweigh the benefits that may result.  If the potential benefits in the aggregate are outweighed to this 
degree, then they are simply not worth identifying in individual cases.""  United States v. Container Corp. of America, 393 U.S. 333, 341, 21 L. Ed. 2d 526, 89 S. Ct. 510 (1969) (Marshall, J., 
dissenting).  See also Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5, 78 S. Ct. 514, 518, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958); 
Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society, 457 U.S. 332, 344 & n. 14, 102 S. Ct. 2466, 2473 & n. 14, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48, 50 
U.S.L.W. 4687, 4690 & n. 14 (1982). In the context of restraints ancillary to integration, however, it cannot be said that in the 
aggregate ""the gains from imposition of the rule will far outweigh the losses."" The integration of productive activities may permit 
efficiencies of scale regarding research, advertising, and manufacturing; output may be enhanced; new entry into various 
markets may be facilitated.  See Brodley, Joint Ventures and Antitrust Policy, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 1523, 1527-29 (1982); R. Bork, 
The Antitrust Paradox 263-66 (1978); L. Sullivan, Handbook of the Law of Antitrust § 77, at 207 (1977).  Cases applying the per 
se rule to naked price restraints confirm that in some circumstances price restraints ancillary to an integration of functions will 
escape the per se rule. ""If a clinic offered complete medical coverage for a flat fee, the cooperating doctors would have the type 
of partnership arrangement in which a price fixing agreement among the doctors would be perfectly proper."" Maricopa County, 
50 U.S.L.W. at 4693. "
769,7," Another twist on this argument is that promoting spectator consumption ensures that gate receipts will be large enough to 
enable institutions to fund football and other athletic programs.  It is argued that in this manner the plan ensures an adequate 
number of teams to permit intercollegiate competition.  To a certain extent, this argument is not unlike the contention that 
something other than competition is needed in the industry.  Such an argument is not permitted under the Sherman Act. National 
Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 689, 696, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637, 98 S. Ct. 1355 (1978). If a market 
structure other than competition is necessary to engage in a line of commerce, Congress must be petitioned for an exemption 
from the antitrust laws."
769,8, The district court ultimately rejected the argument that the plan enhances live viewership. 546 F. Supp. at 1295-96. 
770,9," The trial court's findings suggest that it placed the burden of proving the effectiveness and necessity of these restraints upon 
the NCAA.  We believe that is the proper placement of the burden when considering whether to apply per se or rule of reason 
analysis to admitted price restraints that the defendant attempts to justify as properly ancillary to a legitimate integration."
770,10," The price-distorting restraints, articles 10 and 13 of the television plan, relate to fostering athletic balance and enhancing live 
viewership -- arguments rejected above."
770,11," The establishment of a minimum aggregate compensation is a necessary incident to the conferral of exclusive rights: it 
prevents the networks from abusing their position vis-a-vis the individual schools.  Therefore, in cases in which the granting of an 
exclusive right is appropriate, the setting of a price for that exclusive right may also be appropriate."
770,12," The evidence consists largely of the testimony of Paul Klein.  Klein testified that football would constitute viable network 
programming only if the network and advertising sponsors were granted exclusivity.  That is, the networks would be unable to 
attract advertising sponsors if football programming competed head-to-head with other football programming. According to Klein, 
the plan's effect of permitting schools to sell only to ABC, CBS, and Turner is essential to the joint marketing arrangement."
770,13," This argument assumes that NCAA football may be viewed as a single brand, a product of the joint venture rather than of the 
individual schools, and that football is in the same product market as other television programming. Upon the facial examination 
appropriate in the per se context these assumptions appear unlikely to be true. "
771,14," This conclusion, of course, obviates the necessity of examining whether the plan's restraints enhance the effectiveness of the 
marketing integration or are no broader than necessary for that purpose.  When an integration is itself impermissible, the 
restraints justified as accompanying it are likewise impermissible."
771,15," To the extent that the procompetitive justifications offered by the NCAA do not relate to an integration, but are offered to show 
the generally procompetitive nature of the television plan, they are foreclosed by Maricopa County. "
772,," ""The respondents' principal argument is that the per se rule is inapplicable because their agreements are alleged to have 
procompetitive justifications.  The argument indicates a misunderstanding of the per se concept.  The anticompetitive 
potential inherent in all price fixing agreements justifies their facial invalidation even if procompetitive justifications are 
offered for some.  Those claims of enhanced competition are so unlikely to prove significant in any particular case that we 
adhere to the rule of law that is justified in its general application."" "
772,457," U.S. at 351, 102 S. Ct. at 2477, 50 U.S.L.W. at 4692 (footnote omitted). "
774,16," The NCAA makes no separate argument urging reversal of the trial court's monopolization holding under section 2 of the 
Sherman Act. It notes the court's conclusion that the relevant market was the sale of rights to televise live college football 
games, in which the NCAA ""obviously has the dominant share."" Appellant's Brief at 10.  The NCAA refers to its market definition 
argument, contending only that it does not possess market power and not that such power if possessed was lawfully obtained.  
Because of this and our disposition of the section 1 issues, we do not consider the monopolization claim.  A reversal of the 
court's section 2 ruling would not affect the scope of relief granted. "
775,17," Because the rights were sold as a package only, broadcasters who lacked the financial resources necessary to purchase the 
package were foreclosed from bidding.  We need not decide whether this constitutes an unlawful restraint under other antitrust 
theories; it does not implicate the per se rule against boycotts. "
777,18," The athletic director of the University of Southern California has stated that paragraph four has this effect.  See Sports 
Illustrated, Sept. 27, 1982, at 9, 12. "
787,1," As the court has determined that defendants' motion be granted in its entirety, plaintiff's cross-motion for partial summary 
judgment is accordingly denied. "
788,2," HN5[
] 15 U.S.C. § 2 provides: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of 
a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding one million dollars if a corporation, or, if any 
other person, one hundred thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding three years, or by both said punishments, in 
the discretion of the court. "
789,*, Published by Hayden
789,**, Published by UTP 
790,3," Hayden argues that the failure of other publications to lower their prices in response to Gold Book's entry onto the market is 
evidence that none considered Gold Book a competitor. Thus, concludes Hayden, none should be included within the relevant 
product market.  The court cannot accept plaintiff's argument. Any test, solely designed to measure the reaction of other publications to Gold Book's entry onto the market, would seem to 
focus on the wrong side of issue.  By ignoring consumers and concentrating instead upon the reaction of other sellers, plaintiff's 
argument is of extremely limited value.  See L.G. Balfour Company v. F.T.C., 442 F.2d 1, 11 (7th Cir. 1971); United States v. 
Bethlehem Steel Corp., 168 F. Supp. 576 (S.D.N.Y. 1958). The court notes further, that while failing to reduce prices, most of the 
publications cited by defendants did not raise their prices either.  More importantly, the particular gauge of competitor response 
urged by Hayden cannot be deemed as dispositive as to this issue.  The record is replete with examples of identical or 
equivalent advertising in editions of Gold Book and a number of the other publications, including EEM. "
791,4," While Brown Shoe concerned violation of Section 7 of Clayton Act, the rule of the case has been applied to cases arising under 
Section 2 of the Sherman Act. United States v. Grinnell Corp., [1966 TRADE CASES P 71,789], 384 U.S. 563, 572-73, 86 S. Ct. 
1698, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1966); Borden Inc. v. F.T.C., [1982 TRADE CASES P 64,558], 674 F.2d at 509-10. "
793,5," HN14[
] 15 U.S.C. § 1 provides in pertinent part that: every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce . . . is declared 
to be illegal . . . ."
793,6," Had plaintiff alleged a per se violation of Section 1, such a determination would not be required.  See Klor's v. Broadway-Hale 
Stores, Inc. [1959 TRADE CASES P 69,316], 359 U.S. 207, 79 S. Ct. 705, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741 (1959); Langston Corp. v. Standard 
Register Co. [1982-83 TRADE CASES P 65,118], 553 F. Supp. 632, 638 (N.D. Georgia 1982). "
803,1," CAC was also a commissioned sales representative for Grason-Stadler audiometric products during the entire period of time it 
was a GenRad distributor, having become such a sales representative prior to 1974 and having remained such until sometime 
after this litigation was commenced.  Grason-Stadler was first a subsidiary and later an unincorporated division of GenRad, until 
it was spun off on January 1, 1978.  All of the claims in this litigation relate to CAC's relationship with GenRad as one of its 
sound product distributors and not to its relationship with Grason-Stadler. "
808,2," See Sherman Act, § 1 Violations, supra. "
815,1," While the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has detailed at length why an interlocutory order preliminarily 
approving a proposed settlement and conditionally determining a temporary settlement class is not appealable, In Re Beef 
Industry Antitrust Litigation, 607 F.2d 167, 180-83 (5th Cir. 1979) (Wisdom, J.), the Court has attempted to provide counsel with 
a written opinion on relatively ""short order"" should any party choose to seek immediate appellate relief.  Consequently, this 
opinion cannot be quite as comprehensive as might otherwise be appropriate.  The Court refers the reader interested in the 
nature and background of this litigation to its recent summary judgment opinion.  In Re Mid-Atlantic Toyota Antitrust Litigation, 
560 F. Supp. 760 (D. Md. 1983)."
815,2," The Court has on occasion referred to the ""Distributor defendants"" as the ""Weisman defendants"" to stress the role played 
within them by defendant Frederick R. Weisman.  The terms ""Distributor defendants"" and ""Weisman defendants"" should be 
considered to be synonyms."
815,3," Section 26 of the Settlement mandates that the plaintiffs retain a right of recission against participating Dealer defendants 
unless Dealer defendants settling in at least two thirds of the relevant sales of 1980 Toyotas join the Settlement on or before 
May 29, 1983. "
816,4," The only restriction upon the last option is that the beneficiary must use the certificate for at least $100.00 worth of goods, 
services or trade-in allowance."
816,5," While the Settlement is not clear, it appears that plaintiffs' counsel in the private actions will share in this award of fees. "
819,6," The Court again refers the reader interested in a more detailed assessment of the potential evidence to the April 4, 1983 
summary judgment ruling."
819,7," The Court stresses that the issue of ""damages"", like the issue of ""injury,"" has only been resolved at the level of facial 
allegations.  The Court in no way prejudges the resolution of either of these issues when the matters are more fully developed."
819,8," Dealer defendants assert that the Court would irrevocably err by preliminarily approving the Settlement before examining the 
States' economic evidence.  While the Manual on Complex Litigation does suggest that a court examine the economic evidence 
before issuing a preliminary approval, Manual on Complex Litigation, supra, § 1.46 at 64, the Court believes that rigid application 
of this recommendation would not be appropriate in the present context.  Production of economic evidence would necessitate 
several months delay, and would disrupt the Settlement's carefully negotiated timetable and equilibrium.  In addition, the Court's 
thorough familiarity with the possible range of recoverable damages in this action leaves it fully satisfied that the Settlement falls 
within the possible range of adequate settlements."
819,9," This is particularly true when one considers the interest which would accrue on their contribution pending resolution of the 
continuing litigation against non-settling Dealer defendants. "
820,10," Florida Power Corp. v. Granlund, 82 F.R.D. 690 (M.D. Fla. 1979), is the only case which has gone beyond protecting the non-
settling defendants rights to indemnity and contribution.  In Granlund, the court refused to approve a settlement which would 
create a previously non-existent right of indemnification in the settling defendant, expose the non-settling defendants to the risk "
821,," of multiple litigation, and prohibit the non-settling defendants from exercising an otherwise valid in pari delicto defense.  The 
Court notes that all of the rights vindicated in Granlund were once again formal, legal rights."
821,11," Dealer defendants make no arguments relative to the potential impairment of their contribution rights.  No right to contribution 
exists under the federal antitrust laws.  Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 68 L. Ed. 2d 500, 101 S. 
Ct. 2061 (1981). While the complaint also asserts violations of various state statutes, Section 28 of the Settlement expressly 
provides for a pro rata reduction of damages recovered by the plaintiffs against the non-settling defendants should a court 
subsequently determine that a right of contribution exists.  Such a reduction would remove the right to contribution, since the 
non-settling defendants would not be liable for more than their proportionate share.  See Altman v. Liberty Equities Corp., 54 
F.R.D. at 624."
821,12," Dealer defendants attempt to distinguish the overwhelming mass of authority reviewed above on the grounds that none of the 
settlements under scrutiny in those cases purported to establish the terms upon which a non-signatory could join the agreement.  
While the Settlement does appear to be unique in that respect, the argument provides Dealer defendants with no relief.  Under 
the above authorities, Dealer defendants would have had no standing to object to a pure partial settlement between plaintiffs and 
Distributor defendants which did not curtail their formal, legal rights. The fact that Distributor defendants would subsequently 
cooperate with the plaintiffs would be a ""well established"" ground for approving such a partial settlement. In Re Ampicillin 
Antitrust Litigation, 82 F.R.D. at 654. Given the Dealer defendants' clear lack of standing in a pure partial settlement, the fact that 
the signatory parties have attempted to give the Dealer defendants an alternative option to proceeding alone in this protracted 
litigation does not suddenly create standing.  The ""opt in"" provisions of the Settlement do not lie at the root of the Dealer 
defendants' objections; the prospect of continuing this expensive litigation alone does.  In purely practical terms, the existence of 
the global settlement with its ""opt in"" provision leaves the Dealer defendants better off than if Distributor defendants and plaintiffs 
had struck the standard ""separate deal."" As the signatory parties had the unquestioned right to leave the Dealer defendants as 
the sole defendants in this case, they certainly are free to provide the Dealer defendants with a potentially more palatable 
alternative to that situation.  Simply put, ""standing"" cannot be conferred on Dealer defendants because of provisions in the 
Settlement which can only help the Dealer defendants. "
822,13," A temporary settlement class is a class tentatively formed for the purposes of anticipated settlement only.  Completely 
ancillary to the proposed settlement, it lasts only as long as the period between the preliminary approval of the settlement and 
the court's final determination on the settlement. At the time of the court's final adjudication of the proposed settlement, the court 
decides whether or not to certify a permanent settlement class.  In effect, a temporary settlement class serves only as a 
procedural vehicle for providing notice to putative members of a proposed class of the terms of the anticipated settlement and of 
their opportunity to ""opt out"" and/or object.  See generally Beef Industry, 607 F.2d at 173-78; 3 Newberg on Class Actions, 
supra, at § 5570c."
822,14," If a sufficient number of Dealer defendants do not join the Settlement, and notice to consumers does not issue, the Temporary 
Settlement Class will also automatically expire.  The Court would then consider ""recreating"" a Temporary Settlement Class at 
any later date that notice might issue."
822,15," The Court stresses that the ""temporary settlement class"" being addressed today was not considered by the United States 
Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Shelton v. Pargo, Inc., 582 F.2d at 1298. Shelton held that potential class members 
need only be given notice of a proposed precertification settlement if the district court determines after a hearing that the 
precertification settlement has been the product of collusion or that putative class members have detrimentally relied upon the 
assumed maintenance of the class action. As the Fourth Circuit noted, a precertification settlement ""binds solely the individual 
plaintiff and not absentee class members."" Shelton v. Pargo, Inc., 582 F.2d at 1303. In the present case, on the other hand, the 
signatory parties clearly intend that the Settlement will bind members of the Temporary Settlement Class.  To avoid any 
confusion in this area of occasional terminological looseness, the Court reiterates that it is presiding over the ""temporary 
settlement class"" discussed in Beef Industry and not the ""precertification settlement"" considered in Shelton. "
823,16," These same factors serve to distinguish the present case from the primary appellate discussion of temporary settlement 
classes since Beef Industry, Plummer v. Chemical Bank, 668 F.2d 654 (2nd Cir. 1982). In Plummer, counsel for the putative 
class had negotiated the proposed settlement prior to the filing of the complaint, and the named plaintiffs appeared to receive 
more favorable settlement terms than the unnamed members of the prospective class did.  The district court disapproved the 
settlement, and the Circuit Court affirmed stressing the factors noted above.  As outlined previously, no such indicia of collusion 
or overreaching exist in the present case.  It should also be noted that Plummer involved a final disapproval of a settlement and 
a denial of certification for a permanent settlement class.  The step mandated by the present ruling, notice to prospective 
members of a permanent settlement class, was in fact undertaken without comment in Plummer.  Plummer, 668 F.2d at 657."
823,17," As the estimated membership in the proposed class exceeds 3000, joinder is impracticable.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(1).  As 
outlined in detail in the April 4, 1983 opinion, members of the class may have suffered at the hands of a large antitrust 
conspiracy, so common questions of law and fact obtain.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(2).  Similarly, the antitrust claims of the 
representatives are typical of the antitrust claims that any purchaser of a new 1980 Toyota from a Dealer defendant would 
attempt to assert.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(3).  The ""adequacy"" determination of Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(4) is discussed infra in the body 
of the opinion."
823,18," While damages may vary among individual purchasers, common questions of law and fact clearly predominate, and a class 
action certainly is superior to other methods, if any are available, of fairly and efficiently adjudicating this controversy.  As the 
amount of damages suffered by an individual purchaser is relatively small, the purchaser would have little interest in maintaining 
a separate action.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3)(A).  Litigation over factually identical claims is currently before the Court and it makes 
excellent sense to resolve these matters simultaneously.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3)(B).  The fact that the Panel on Multi-district 
Litigation has transferred all actions relating to these matters to the Court indicates the desirability of concentrating the litigation 
of the class claims in this forum.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3)(C).  Finally, any ""difficulties likely to be encountered in the management 
of a class action,"" if they exist in the instant action, are already being encountered by the Court in the parallel parens actions.  
Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3)(D). "
827,1," The motions pending include a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Statute of Limitations) filed by all of the defendants 
except defendant Commonwealth which joined in the motion and filed its own Motion for Summary Judgment. The plaintiff filed a 
partial summary judgment motion raising several bases for partial summary judgment and four of the defendants filed a Motion 
for Partial Summary Judgment Regarding Take-Off, Inc. The plaintiff had also filed a Motion to Amend Complaint which was 
withdrawn at the hearing on these motions. I heard argument on the questions presented by the various summary judgment 
motions. The defendant Lawyers Title Insurance Corporation's Motion for Protective Order was submitted on the briefs."
827,2," The Complaint defines the relevant market as the 6-county area. From the late 1950's until at least 1967, there were four 
counties considered as part of the metropolitan area for the purposes of this case: Denver, Adams, Arapahoe, and Jefferson. 
See letter of April 13, 1967, from Colorado Title Company contained in Appendix V to plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary 
Judgment, item 49. Subsequently, the reach of the defendants' allegedly concerted activities through SKLD and Take-Off, Inc. 
(identified and discussed infra) expanded to include activity in Boulder and Douglas counties as well as in Larimer, Eagle, Clear 
Creek and Weld counties. See generally Take-Off, Inc., 1981 Annual Report to Stockholders contained in Appendix V, item 47 
and Appendix III, item 31 -- Schedule J, plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. For the purposes of this memorandum, 
the 6-county area will be considered as the Denver metropolitan area during the relevant time period: 1977 to 1981, as set forth 
in the Complaint."
827,3," The plaintiff had filed a Motion to Amend Complaint which would have clarified certain of the factual allegations contained in the 
Complaint, however, this motion was withdrawn. The proposed amended Complaint deleted the ""plaintiff's claims under § 2 of 
the Sherman Act and the defendants stipulated to the dismissal of those claims."
827,4," At the time I heard this Motion, the defendants included Ticor Title Insurance Company which was originally named Pioneer 
National Title Insurance Company. I approved a Stipulation for Dismissal of this action against Ticor on May 18, 1983."

831,22," Concerted refusal to deal or group boycotts have been determined to be inherently anti-competitive, and therefore the

Ct. 514, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1957), Justice Black concluded: [T]here are certain agreements or practices which because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any 
redeeming virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the 
precise harm they have caused or the business excuse for their use. This principal of per se unreasonableness not only 
makes the type of restraints which are proscribed by the Sherman Act more certain to the benefit of everyone concerned, 
but it also avoids the necessity for an incredibly complicated and prolonged economic investigation into the entire history of 
the industry involved, as well as related industries, in an effort to determine at large whether a particular restraint has been 
unreasonable--an inquiry so often wholly fruitless when undertaken."

834,38," As Lawyers' counsel points out in its .reply, the plaintiff apparently concedes that the privilege was not waived by the mere 
inadvertant release of the document. "
835,39," The plaintiff has filed no conflicting affidavits in support of its opposition to this motion; thus, all of the defendant's affidavits are 
uncontroverted."
835,40," Mr. Hartley's Affidavit states, in part:"
835,9," . Lawyers Title has produced over 4,000 documents in this case. The other defendants and third-party witnesses have 
produced thousands more. I do not know how our screening process failed to identify and segregate the document in 
question. I do know that had I realized the document was included in those produced to plaintiff, I would have certainly 
withheld it. In fact, another copy of the same letter was located and withheld."
835,10," . I have not been authorized by my client to waive the attorney-client privilege in this case with respect to the subject 
document or its subject matter. On no occasion have I intended to do so, and it was not my intention to produce this letter 
for plaintiff to inspect and copy. "
836,41,"  Indeed, as indicated previously, plaintiff apparently does not assert evidence of intentional waiver through the mere release of 
the document. C. F. Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461 (1938). Instead, plaintiff argues that 
McLaughlin's act of sending the document to the Lawyers' home office demonstrates intent to waive the privilege by breaching 
confidentiality through the exposure of this document to persons not on the SKLD board. This argument is not persuasive. See 
Dunn Chemical Co. v. Sybron Corp., 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15801, 1975-2 Trade Cas. (CCH) at P60,561 (S.D.N.Y. 1975)."
836,42," Mr. Hartley's comment ""People -- even lawyers -- make mistakes,"" I can only reply ""To err is human, to forgive divine."" "
840,1," The District Court assessed only the sufficiency of the complaint and did not render an adverse summary judgment, even 
though the submission of affidavits might have permitted the defendants' motion to dismiss to be treated as a motion for 
summary judgment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c).  This testing of the complaint alone, a course that inured to the plaintiff's 
advantage, since the dismissal was with leave to amend, was proper."
840,2," The District Court also concluded that, if the complaint was endeavoring to allege jurisdiction based on the interstate movement 
of plaintiff's patients, this basis was legally insufficient.  On appeal, plaintiff does not claim that her complaint should be 
understood as making such an allegation, and we therefore do not consider it. "
841,3," Though Western Waste announced a broad rule focusing on defendant's activities ""independent of the violation,"" 616 F.2d at 
1097, Judge Kennedy's opinion was careful to detail numerous respects in which the alleged illegality could be expected to 
affect interstate commerce. Id. at 1097-99. "
842,4," It is possible that Judge Sifton was rejecting consideration of defendants' activities not as a matter of substantive law, but only 
as a matter of procedure for lack of an adequate pleading; if the latter is the case, we are in agreement with him, as our 
subsequent discussion will reveal."
842,5," In her brief Dr. Furlong alleges that she is prepared to prove that defendants' conduct affected interstate commerce by 
diminishing her purchase of out-of-state equipment and supplies.  However, the complaint contains no allegation to this effect, 
much less an adequate claim of an amount of diminished out-of-state purchases that could be evaluated by the District Court 
against the standard of a ""not insubstantial"" effect on commerce. Plaintiff's opportunity to amend her complaint will enable her to 
plead such an allegation if it can be made in good faith. "

recodification was not intended to make any ""substantive change in the law"" (see section 3(a) of P.L. 95-473, 92 Stat. 1466), it 
extensively revised the structure and language of the Act. Moreover, beginning in 1976, Congress made substantive changes in 
the Act culminating in the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, 94 Stat. 1895. This court will cite to the pre-1978 version of the ICA since

888,4," HN5[
] 49 U.S.C. § 5b(9) sets the standard for ICC approval of an agreement among rail carriers: Application to Commission for approval of agreements, rules and regulations (2) Any carrier party to an agreement between or among two or more carriers relating to rates, fares, classifications, 
divisions, allowances or charges (including charges between carriers and compensation paid or received for the use of 
facilities and equipment), or rules and regulations pertaining thereto, or procedures for the joint consideration, initiation or 
establishment thereof, may, under such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe, apply to the Commission 
for approval of the agreement, and the Commission shall by order approve any such agreement (if approval thereof is not 
prohibited by paragraph (4), (5), or (6) of this section) if it finds that, by reason of furtherance of the national transportation 
policy declared in this Act, the relief provided in paragraph (9) of this section should apply with respect to the making and 
carrying out of such agreement; otherwise the application shall be denied. The approval of the Commission shall be 
granted only upon such terms and conditions as the Commission may prescribe as necessary to enable it to grant its 
approval in accordance with the standard above set forth in this paragraph. HN6[
] 49 U.S.C. § 5b(9), the express immunity provision, provides in full: Relief from operation of antitrust laws (9) Parties to any agreement approved by the Commission under this section and other persons are, if the approval of such 
agreement is not prohibited by paragraph (4), (5), or (6) of this section, relieved from the operation of the antitrust laws with 
respect to the making of such agreement, and with respect to the carrying out of such agreement in conformity with its 
provisions and in conformity with the terms and conditions prescribed by the Commission. The validity of the ICC approved Eastern Railroads -- Agreements, infra, is not at issue in this case. Thus, none of the 
prohibitions in paragraphs (4), (5), and (6) set out below are claimed or found to be applicable.  However, the plaintiff is not 
precluded from arguing that defendants agreed to forego their rights of independent action in violation of their agreement as part 
of a conspiracy to eliminate competition. Agreements between carriers of different classes (4) The Commission shall not approve under this section any agreement between or among carriers of different classes 
unless it finds that such agreement is of the character described in paragraph (2) of this section and is limited to matters 
relating to transportation under joint rates or over through routes; and for purposes of this paragraph carriers by railroad, 
express companies, and sleeping-car companies are carriers of one class; pipe-line companies are carriers of one class; 
carriers by motor vehicle are carriers of one class; carriers by water are carriers of one class; and freight forwarders are 
carriers of one class. Pooling or division agreements "
889,," (5) The Commission shall not approve under this section any agreement which it finds is an agreement with respect to a 
pooling, division, or other matter or transaction, to which section 5 of this title is applicable. Agreements for determining matters through joint consideration (6) The Commission shall not approve under this section any agreement which establishes a procedure for the 
determination of any matter through joint consideration unless it finds that under the agreement there is accorded to each 
party the free and unrestrained right to take independent action either before or after any determination arrived at through 
such procedure."
889,5," HN8[
] 49 U.S.C. § 5b(7) reads in full: (7) The Commission is authorized, upon complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint, to investigate and determine 
whether any agreement previously approved by it under this section, or terms and conditions upon which such approval 
was granted, is not or are not in conformity with the standard set forth in paragraph (2) of this section, or whether any such 
terms and conditions are not necessary for purposes of conformity with such standard, and, after such investigation, the 
Commission shall by order terminate or modify its approval of such agreement if it finds such action necessary to insure 
conformity with such standard, and shall modify the terms and conditions upon which such approval was granted to the "
890,," extent it finds necessary to insure conformity with such standard or to the extent to which it finds such terms and conditions 
not necessary to insure such conformity. The effective date of any order terminating or modifying approval, or modifying 
terms and conditions, shall be postponed for such period as the Commission determines to be reasonably necessary to 
avoid undue hardship. Paragraph 2 is set forth slip op. at 11, supra."
890,6," Indeed, in Iron Ore Rate Cases, 44 I.C.C. 368, 376 (1917), the ICC discussed the issue of dock rates for iron ore at Lake Erie 
ports and observed: It is of course in the interest of the carriers that the ore should move over their own docks, since the cost per ton for 
overhead expenses tends to decrease as the tonnage handled over the docks increases; but the right of the shippers or 
others to operate docks of their own can not be denied, and if they can perform the service at a less cost per ton than the 
carriers charge, of it they elect to assess a lower charge for the service than the maximum allowed to the carriers, these are 
matters with which, as the situation is now understood, we are not concerned . . . Any service performed by the private 
docks in the way of loading, handling or storing the ore prior to the time of shipment is a matter to be disposed of between 
the dock and the shipper of ore. "
892,7," At the time of the statement, paragraph 6 of S. 110, the Senate Bill, contained the following language inserted at the behest of 
Senator Russell: Nothing in this section and no approval of any agreement by the Commission under this section shall be so construed as in 
any manner to remove from the purview of the antitrust laws any restraint upon the right of independent action by means of 
boycott, duress, or intimidation. This language was removed by the House Conference Committee before passage of the final bill. The legislative history is 
barren of specific reasons as to why this language was removed. Hence, no legislative intent may be inferred from the removal 
of Senator Russell's amendment to the Senate bill. But it appears from the following exchange with Senator O'Mahoney 
(Montana) that Senator Reed felt that the Russell amendment was not needed: MR. O'MAHONEY. Just another quotation, with the Senator's indulgence.  This was an amendment which was inserted by 
the Senate in order to make sure that no conspiracies would be permitted under the Bulwinkle-Reed bill. I read from 
paragraph (6): Nothing in this section and no approval of any agreement by the Commission under this section shall be so construed as in 
any manner to remove from the purview of the antitrust laws any restraint upon the right of independent action by any 
carrier by means of boycott, duress, or intimidation. In other words, the Senate said there should be no approval of any device by which boycott, duress, or intimidation should be 
applied to any carrier. The conference eliminated that amendment. Is that the way to prevent conspiracy? MR. REED. When some useless language is inserted in a bill for political purposes, and accepted by the Senator in charge of 
the bill at the end of 5 days' debate in order to get the bill through the Senate, and the conferees on the part of the House say, ""If 
you expect us to consider that kind of bunk seriously you are mistaken."" MR. O'MAHONEY. Does the Senator say it is useless to prevent boycott, coercion, or intimidation, and can it be prohibited 
when exemption is being granted from the law which enforces it? MR. REED. Of course we are not granting any exemption. The constant misstatements of the Senator from Wyoming -- I wish 
he would make them in his own time -- Mr. O'MAHONEY. There is no limitation on debate. MR. REED. No; and certainly the Senator from Wyoming exercises his privilege very freely in that respect. MR. O'MAHONEY. Does the Senator object to being catechised on this subject? MR. REED. It would not do any good to object to the Senator from Wyoming utilizing his privilege as a Senator and taking a lot 
of time in debate. MR. O'MAHONEY. The Senator can substitute personalities for argument, and I have no objection to that, because I know 
the RECORD will show that personalities cannot outweigh the facts. The facts are that the Senate put in the bill a 
prohibition against boycott, intimidation, and coercion, and the conferees took it out. MR. REED. It is in the law, anyway. MR. O'MAHONEY. Where? MR. REED. I shall call attention to it later. I ask the Senator from Wyoming to permit me to complete my statement, and 
then make his speech and make his statements, including his misstatements, in his own time. "
893,, MR. O'MAHONEY. Will the Senator be good enough to point out my misstatements? MR. REED. I do not yield.
893,94, Cong. Rec. 8417 (1948).
893,8," The court accords greater weight to the statements of the bill's authors as to the scope and breadth of the bill than to the 
assertions of the bill's opponents that its adoption would permit the railroads to engage in ""boycotts, coercion, or intimidation."" 
The opponents' warnings do not override the intent of the bill's framers. As the Supreme Court stated in Schwegmann Bros. v. 
Calvert Corp., 341 U.S. 384, 394-95, 95 L. Ed. 1035, 71 S. Ct. 745 (1951): HN11[
] The fears and doubts of the opposition are no authoritative guide to the construction of legislation. It is the 
sponsors that we look to when the meaning of the statutory words is in doubt. Similarly, in Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 204, 47 L. Ed. 2d 668, 96 S. Ct. 1375, n. 24 (1976), the court observed: Remarks of this kind made in the course of legislative debate or hearings other than by persons responsible for the 
preparation or the drafting of a bill are entitled to little weight. See, e.g., United States v. United Mine Workers, 330 U.S. 
258, 276-77, 91 L. Ed. 884, 67 S. Ct. 677 (1947); United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co., 315 U.S. 110, 125, 86 L. Ed. 726, 
62 S. Ct. 523 (1942). This is especially so with regard to the statements of legislative opponents who ""in their zeal to defeat 
a bill . . .  understandably tend to overstate its reach."" NLRB v. Fruit Packers, 377 U.S. 58, 66, 12 L. Ed. 2d 129, 84 S. Ct. 
1063 (1964). See Schwegmann Bros.  v. Calvert Distillers Corp., 341 U.S. 384, 394-395, 95 L. Ed. 1035, 71 S. Ct. 745 
(1951)."
893,9," Representative Bulwinkle continued: The conspiracy charged by the State of Georgia is a conspiracy to fix rates by coercion and to discriminate against the 
State of Georgia in the rates so fixed. This is the way the Supreme Court construed Georgia's pleading; it was this kind of a 
cause of action that the Supreme Court permitted the State to bring. . . . The Supreme Court in its opinion granting the State of Georgia leave to file its amended bill of complaint held that a 
certificate issued under a statutory provision similar to S. 110 did not prevent the Court from granting the State of Georgia 
equitable relief if the State could prove its charges. This holding was made with respect to the effect of certificate 44 which "
894,," had been issued under section 12 of the act of June 11, 1942. The provisions of that act were analogous to the provisions 
of S. 110. The act authorized the Chairman of the War Production Board to issue certificates which provided that the 
antitrust law should not apply to certain kinds of activity which were found by the Chairman of the War Production Board to 
be requisite to the prosecution of the war. Such a certificate had been issued by the Chairman of the War Production Board 
with respect to the rate conferences and committees involved in the Georgia case. The Supreme Court held that this 
certificate did not prevent the State of Georgia from bringing suit in the Supreme Court. Speaking of certificate 44 the Court 
said: It does not sanction the use of coercion. It does not authorize any combination to discriminate against a region in the 
establishment of rates.  ( Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 324 U.S. 439, 459, 65 S. Ct. 716, 89 L. Ed. 1051), footnote 7.) This holding of the Supreme Court is a decisive answer to the suggestion that if S. 110 becomes law the Georgia case will 
be moot and the Supreme Court will be prevented from granting relief to the State of Georgia. It follows that if the State of Georgia can prove that, in fact, the railroads have combined and conspired to fix rates by 
coercion and to discriminate against the State of Georgia, nothing in S. 110 will prevent the Supreme Court from issuing an 
injunction that prohibits the railroads from engaging in that kind of activity."
894,94, Cong. Rec. Append. 4033-34 (1948). 
897,10," The Aircoach reasoning has been applied in the context of a variety of other regulated industries. For example, see U.S. v. 
Braniff Airways, Inc., 453 F. Supp. 724 (W.D. Tex. 1978) (conspiracy to eliminate an air competitor not immunized by the 
Federal Aviation Act's express immunity provision), and Aloha Airlines, Inc. v. Hawaiian Airlines, Inc., 489 F.2d 203 (9th Cir. 
1973), cert. denied, 417 U.S. 913, 41 L. Ed. 2d 217, 94 S. Ct. 2612 (1974). Also see United States v. American Telephone & 
Telegraph Co., 461 F. Supp. 1314, 1328-29 (D.D.C. 1978), in which the court ruled: This complaint alleges a broad conspiracy to monopolize various aspects of the telecommunications industry through a 
symbiotic relationship among AT&T, Western Electric, Bell Labs, and the Bell Operating Companies (see p. 1350, supra). 
Even if it be assumed, arguendo, that the Commission exercised explicit regulatory authority over some segments of the 
activities challenged in the complaint, it does not follow that defendants are immune from antitrust liability even with respect 
to them. Defendants' purpose is alleged to be the monopolization of the telecommunications service and equipment market, 
and the bulk of their conduct, including that revolving around Western Electric and Bell Labs, cannot under any reasonable 
view be regarded as immune from antitrust enforcement by virtue of regulation. In that circumstance, the remainder of the 
challenged conduct is likewise subject to antitrust consideration, both because it constitutes a means for achieving an 
unlawful end California Motor Transport v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 515, 92 S. Ct. 609, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1972), 
and because it represents one facet of a larger monopolistic scheme. Id. at 1329-30."
897,11," As noted in the House Report accompanying the Reed-Bulwinkle Amendment with respect to 5a agreements: It is important to note . . . that in the case of a rate association, or any similar joint organization, it is not the rates or other 
collective actions resulting from the association procedures that the bill contemplates will be submitted by the carriers to the 
Commission for approval. What is to be submitted in such case is the basic agreement setting up the association and 
defining the nature and scope of its activities and its mode of procedures. H. Report at p. 1855. Unlike the plaintiff in McLean, plaintiff Pinney is not challenging the immunity of the ICC approved 
agreement. Rather, plaintiff alleges that the defendants acted outside of and contrary to the agreement by conspiring to 
eliminate it as a competitor and monopolize the industry. "
898,," For the reasons outlined, the court also finds Interstate Investors, Inc.  v. Transcontinental Bus Sys., Inc., 310 F. Supp. 1053 
(S.D.N.Y. 1970), cited by the defendants, to be inapplicable to the present case. See also Hughes Tool Co. v. Trans World 
Airlines, 409 U.S. 363, 34 L. Ed. 2d 577, 93 S. Ct. 647 (1973), and Pan American World Airways v. United States, 371 U.S. 296, 
9 L. Ed. 2d 325, 83 S. Ct. 476 (1963). Two additional cases cited by defendants as supporting the Asbury decision are also inapposite. In Monticello Heights, Inc. v. 
Morgan Drive Away, Inc., 1974-2 TRADE CASES (CCH) P 75,282 (S.D.N.Y. 1974), plaintiff's antitrust claims were dismissed on 
the grounds that they were barred by Keogh v. Chicago & N.W. Ry. Co., 260 U.S. 156, 67 L. Ed. 183, 43 S. Ct. 47 (1922). The 
Keogh doctrine and its applicability to this case are discussed in section III, infra. Baltimore & O.R. Co. v. New York, N.H.&H.R. Co., 196 F. Supp. 724 (S.D.N.Y. 1961), concerned a suit to recover per diem 
rental rates for the use by defendants of plaintiffs' freight cars. As a defense, defendants claimed that despite the existence of a 
binding contract, they were not bound to pay the contractual rate because plaintiffs had fixed the rates and forced defendants to 
pay them in violation of section 5A of the ICA and the Sherman Act. The court ruled that a finding by the Interstate Commerce 
Commission in a previous hearing that the plaintiffs had not engaged in the alleged activities precluded (under the doctrine of 
collateral estoppel) the defendants from relitigating the issue before the court. Neither the Monticello court nor the Baltimore & O.R. Co. court ever addressed the immunity issue facing this court."
898,12," Section 15 of the Shipping Act, 46 U.S.C. § 814, permits water carriers to file with the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) 
agreements relating to rates and other matters. When an agreement is approved by the FMC, it is immunized against the 
operation of the antitrust laws. But see Carnation Co. v. Pacific Conference, 383 U.S. 213, 15 L. Ed. 2d 709, 86 S. Ct. 781 
(1966), and In re Ocean Shipping Antitrust Litigation, 500 F. Supp. 1235 (S.D.N.Y. 1980), for statements that section 15 
antitrust immunity does not extend to the implementation of agreements unapproved by the FMC."
898,13," The court observed that ""the plain language of the section 15 agreements on the present record encompasses carriers' 
agreement to use Murphy as their one devanner in Los Angeles, and that agreement is not directly contested by appellant 
Dreisbach. . . ."" Id. at 724."
898,14," The Ninth Circuit noted that plaintiff Dreisbach's allegations were not ""supported by evidence."" 658 F.2d at 729, n. 9, and at 
730, n. 11. Moreover, the court stated: There is no evidence, and no allegation, that the Carriers here are the only carriers requiring a devanning service in Los 
Angeles, or that Dreisbach was impeded in any manner from seeking to render devanning services in Los Angeles to other 
carriers."
898,658," F.2d at 729, n. 10. The Dreisbach court correctly observed that ""every agreement of carriers to use one supplier of a 
service can be said to confer monopoly status and antitrust immunity on that supplier, at least insofar as rendering the service to 
those carriers is concerned."" In this case, plaintiff alleges that the railroads conspired to completely eliminate them as a direct 
competitor in the dock handling of iron ore. Rather than choosing among competing services, as in Dreisbach, defendants in this 
case are alleged to have conspired to eliminate a competing service, thereby foreclosing the choices of their customers. "
899,15," Citing Eastern Railroad Presidents' Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523 
(1961), and United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585 (1965), defendants argue that 
""the Supreme Court has more recently confirmed that conduct which is otherwise immune from the antitrust laws cannot give 
rise to antitrust liability simply because it was undertaken with predatory intent."" However, this court agrees with the following 
language of Judge Parker in United States v. Baltimore & O.R.R., 538 F. Supp. 200, 207 (D.D.C. 1982): . . . These cases [Noerr and Pennington] provide [defendants] no solace. At issue was the question whether the lobbying of 
the legislature and the executive (Noerr) or the attempt to influence public officials (Pennington) would be immunized from 
the antitrust laws by the First Amendment even when the actions were intended to eliminate competition. Aircoach, on the 
other hand, was concerned not with whether activity otherwise illegal under the Sherman Act is impliedly immunized by a 
constitutional provision but, rather, with whether such conduct is explicitly immunized by the Reed-Bulwinkle Act. In other 
words, the Aircoach Court was guided not by abstract constitutional principles but, rather, by the legislative history and 
statutory intent behind section 5a. "
900,16," Finding the case before it to be ""analytically indistinguishable"" from Sabre Shipping Corp. v. American President Lines, 
Ltd., 285 F. Supp. 949 (S.D. N.Y. 1968), cert. denied, 407 F.2d 173 (2nd Cir.), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 922, 23 L. Ed. 2d 239, 89 
S. Ct. 1774 (1969), the NARI court criticized the portion of the Sabre opinion which held that filed but unapproved rates 
established under the authority of an FMC-approved agreement are shielded from antitrust attack only if they meet the 
substantive requirements of the Shipping Act. Significantly, however, the NARI court never faced the one issue in Sabre which 
bears directly on this case. In Sabre, an independent shipping line charged that defendant shipping lines and conferences conspired to unreasonably 
restrain and monopolize the Hong Kong -- United States and Japan -- United States shipping trade.  Plaintiff alleged that in 
furtherance of the conspiracy, defendants plotted to drive it out of business through a series of predatory rate cuts. The Sabre 
court held that ""predatory rate cutting . . . cannot be immunized by the Commission from the antitrust laws under Section 15."" Id. 
at 957. Since plaintiffs in NARI never alleged that defendants conspired to eliminate them as competitors (plaintiffs in NARI did not 
compete with the ocean lines), the case has little bearing on the issues confronting this court. "
901,17," The Transportation Logistics Dictionary contains the following definition for a ""commodity rate:"" HN14[
] Commodity Rate. A rate on a specific commodity, or article, moving between specific points, sometimes in a 
specific direction, and sometimes for a specific minimum quantity. The purpose of the commodity rate is generally to 
provide a lower rate to reflect lower costs resulting from large scale movement or otherwise. The commodity rate can be 
higher than a class rate, but it usually is not. "
902,18," The Transportation Logistics Dictionary contains the following definitions for ""class rate"" and ""class tariff:"" HN15[
] Class Rate. It is a rate resulting from a rating provided in a classification. While commodity rates are available 
only on limited commodities, a class rate can be found on practically any commodity. The rate in the class rate tariff is 
normally on class 100 commodities. To determine the class rate it is necessary to multiply the first class rate by a 
percentage figure applicable on its rating. In the uniform freight classification, the percentage of first class is automatically 
provided in the classification. That is, a class 87 would mean 87% of first class.  Class rates were created to simplify the 
preceding process providing a specific rate on each commodity moved. Class Tariff. A Tariff containing only class rates. "
903,19," B&LE asserts that ""this rate system was prescribed by the ICC in Class Rate Investigation, 1939, [281] I.C.C. 213 (1951)."" Neither the case cited by B&LE nor its earlier companion, Class Rate Investigation, 1939, 262 I.C.C. 447 (1945), provides any 
justification for defendants' assertions. The focus of these cases was an investigation by the ICC (on its own motion) into ""the 
lawfulness of interstate class rates, all-rail, all-water, and rail-and-water, applicable in the United States generally, except in 
mountain-Pacific territory and between that territory and the remainder of the country."" 262 I.C.C. at 454. Nothing in the 
Commission's wide-ranging findings supports defendants' statement that under ICC rules, they were justified in quoting ""class 
rates"" for iron ore shipments off of private docks at the same time that they were assessing approved ""commodity iron-ore rates"" 
for shipments off of their own docks. Indeed, if such were the case, private docks such as Pinney could never have hoped to 
compete with the railroads in the handling of ex-lake iron ore because the existing freight class rates were so much higher than 
the published commodity iron ore rates. Yet, as previously pointed out, supra, at 16, the ICC itself observed: It is of course in the interest of the carriers that the ore should move over their own docks, . . . but the right of the shippers 
or others to operate docks of their own cannot be denied."
903,44, I.C.C. at 376.
903,20," S. S. McKinley of the B&O noted in a letter of March 4, 1958 to S.  I. Thompson: You have no doubt received copy of proceedings of the joint meeting held at Pittsburgh, Pa. February 26, distributed by 
Chairman Kern March 3. As additional information, after much discussion the attorneys agreed that we could not very well defend publication of 
higher specific line haul rates from the so-called public docks (Pinney at Ashtabula and Cleveland Stevedore at Cleveland) 
than are presently published from railroad and steel company private docks. You will recall higher rates previously had 
been suggested as a means of discouraging the handling of ore over public docks. Therefore, it was decided to docket a proposal with the Coal, Coke & Iron Ore Committee, C.T.R., on behalf of all lines 
publishing rates from railroads docks, to restrict the application of the line haul rates so they will only apply on ore received 
over the railroads' own docks (see CTR Submittal 10448, as amended). Along the same lines in a Penn Central interoffice memorandum of November 21, 1968 to F. R. Weis, R. L. Wilson concluded 
that under Iron Ore Rate Cases, supra, Penn Central ""would have to publish 'line haul ' rates from Ashtabula Harbor, Ohio [for 
Pinney Dock]."" "
904,21," Under Chrysler Corp. v. Fedders Corp., 643 F.2d 1229, 1235 (6th Cir. 1981), to establish standing in an antitrust action, the 
sixth circuit requires: ""(1) that the plaintiff allege injury in fact and (2) that the interest which the plaintiff seeks to protect is arguably within the zone of interests protected by the statute in 
question."" In Associated, supra, the Court noted the sixth circuit's standing test, as well as the tests of several other circuits. The Court then 
observed that ""these labels may lead to contradictory and inconsistent results."" The Court stated ""In our view, courts should 
analyze each situation in light of the factors set forth in the text, infra."" at 536 n. 33. "
905,22," In paragraph 1 of its complaint, plaintiff seeks redress for injuries to its business and property caused by defendants' alleged 
violations of section 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 14. In pertinent part, that section reads: It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, to lease or make a sale or 
contract for sale of goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies, or other commodities . . . or fix a price charged 
therefor, . . . where the effect . . . may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of 
commerce. On its face, 15 U.S.C. § 14 applies only to ""commodities."" Since plaintiff's suit deals with dock and railroad ""services,"" the 
interests plaintiff seeks to protect are not encompassed by 15 U.S.C. § 14. Therefore, plaintiff does not have standing to raise 15 
U.S.C. § 14 in this case. See Capital Temporaries of Hartford, Inc. v. Olsten Corp., 383 F. Supp. 902, 904, n. 8 (D. Conn. 1974)."
905,23," Defendant B&LE also moves for the dismissal of plaintiff's claims relating to coal and coke. The court reserves ruling on the 
issue in view of earlier discovery rulings, see transcript of December 4, 1980 hearing in this case. "
906,24," In a supplemental letter to this court, defendant B&LE reiterates its argument that ""plaintiff lacks standing to complain of 
defendants' iron ore dock handling charges. . . ."" Defendant B&LE argues that under Associated General Contractors v. 
Carpenters, supra, plaintiff could not have been directly injured by the alleged conspiracy to fix dock handling charges. 
Defendant B&LE states: Steel company shippers are the parties which incur -- and are directly affected by -- iron ore dock handling charges . . . 
Indeed, the alleged maintenance of handling charges . . . would necessarily aid Pinney as competitor of defendants. "
908,25," Defendants argue that the court should refer this case to the ICC under United States Navigation Co. v. Cunard Steamship 
Co., 284 U.S. 474, 76 L. Ed. 408, 52 S. Ct. 247 (1932), and Far East Conference v. United States, 342 U.S. 570, 96 L. Ed. 576, 
72 S. Ct. 492 (1952). As the Court made plain in Carnation Co. v. Pacific Conference, 383 U.S. 213, 220, 15 L. Ed. 2d 709, 86 
S. Ct. 781 (1966): Those cases merely hold that courts must refrain from imposing antitrust sanctions for activities of debatable legality under 
the Shipping Act in order to avoid the possibility of conflict between the courts and the Commission. Since the conspiracy alleged in this case will, if proven, not be debatably legal under the Interstate Commerce Act, there is no 
possibility of conflict between the court and the Commission."
908,26," Defendants argue that plaintiff is precluded from seeking relief under the antitrust laws because it could have sought relief for 
any unfair rates from the ICC. However, ""the rights which [plaintiff] claims under the antitrust laws are entirely collateral to those 
which [plaintiff] might have sought under the [Interstate Commerce Act]."" Carnation Co. v. Pacific Conference, 383 U.S. 213, 
224, 15 L. Ed. 2d 709, 86 S. Ct. 781 (1966). Plaintiff's alleged failure to pursue any potential ICC remedies does not prevent it 
from seeking antitrust damages based on a conspiracy to eliminate it as a competitor. "

(3) acquisition of control of a carrier by any number of carriers. (4) acquisition of control of at least 2 carriers by a person that is not a carrier. (5) acquisition of control of a carrier by a person that is not a carrier but that controls any number of carriers. "
920,," We use the term ""merger"" as shorthand for the achievement of common control in any of these ways."
920,3," The sentence in § 11,344(c) referring to conditions does not explicitly refer to the ""public interest."" Nevertheless, the context 
strongly suggests, and the legislative history establishes beyond cavil, Congress' intent that the Commission apply the same 
""public interest"" test both to the basic merger and to any conditions it imposes on the merger. Prior to 1978, the Act directed the 
ICC to approve a merger if the Commission ""finds that, subject to such terms and conditions and such modifications as it shall 
find to be just and reasonable, the proposed transaction is . . . consistent with the public interest."" 49 U.S.C. § 5(2)(b) (1976) 
(emphasis added).  The Interstate Commerce Act was recodified to its current form in 1978 ""without substantive change."" 49 
U.S.C. note preceding § 10,101.  The revisers deleted the words ""just and reasonable"" as redundant ""in view of the words 'the 
transaction is consistent with the public interest. '"" 49 U.S.C. § 11,344 revision note. We therefore reject the suggestions by Guilford and the ICC that the Commission has broader discretion in imposing conditions 
on a merger than in approving or rejecting the merger as a whole."

] The ICC defines ""class I"" railroads as those railroads with annual operating revenues of $ 50 million or more.  49 
C.F.R. § 1240.1(a) (1982).  Under that definition, both the Maine Central and the Boston & Maine are class I railroads."

922,," HN10[
] The Commission has broad authority to impose conditions on consolidations, including those that might be useful 
in ameliorating potential anticompetitive effects of a consolidation. However, the Commission recognizes that conditions 
may lessen the benefits of a consolidation to both the carrier and the public. Therefore, the Commission will not normally 
impose conditions on a consolidation to protect a carrier unless essential services are affected and the condition: (i) is 
shown to be related to the impact of the consolidation; (ii) is designed to enable shippers to receive adequate service; (iii) 
would not pose unreasonable operating or other problems for the consolidated carrier; and (iv) would not frustrate the ability 
of the consolidated carrier to obtain the anticipated public benefits.  Moreover, the Commission believes that 
indemnification is ordinarily not an appropriate remedy in consolidation proceedings.  Indemnification conditions can be 
anticompetitive by requiring the consolidated carrier to subsidize carriers who are no longer able to compete efficiently in 
the marketplace."

asserted injury is less than certain to occur.  We note, however, that the ICC must have thought Providence & Worcester's 
objections were substantial enough to warrant addressing them on the merits.  We shall do likewise.  We defer to the ICC's 
expert judgment that there was a real possibility of harm to Providence & Worcester from an unconditioned merger. (An agency's 
assessment that the probability of injury from the agency's action is too low to confer standing would present a different case that 
we need not address here.) "

would walk away from its substantial investment in [Lamoille Valley]"" and whether the Lamoille Valley's ""excessive dependence 
on revenue from overhead traffic"" might indicate ""unrealistically low"" rates for local traffic, in which case the Lamoille Valley 
could raise its local rates to offset lost revenues from overhead traffic. Boston & Maine Merger, 366 I.C.C. at 353-54. We think that these comments by the ICC, read in context, are dicta.  Moreover, the Commission's speculations are not, so far 
as we can tell, based on any evidence in the record.  Thus, if we believed that this line of reasoning was critical to the ICC's 
decision, we would remand to the Commission for lack of substantial evidence to support its conclusion that the Lamoille Valley 
would continue operating. "
928,20," Guilford asserts that Lamoille Valley failed to show a ""sufficient public need"" for its service.  Guilford Brief at 14-18.  The ICC, 
however, did not refer in its decision to the ""sufficient public need"" requirement.  Thus, the meaning of that phrase is not at issue 
in this case, and we express no view on how the Commission may permissibly interpret it."
928,21," The ICC also explained the close connection between the statutory standard of ""adequacy of transportation to the public"" and 
the essential services test in its decision in this case.  See Boston & Maine Merger, 366 I.C.C. at 348 (""the issue of whether 
conditions should be applied in a consolidation . . . goes essentially to the question of whether the transaction will result in a

930,26," The Transportation Act of 1940, Pub. L. No. 76-785, sec. 7, § 5(2)(c)(1), 54 Stat. 898, 906, added the requirement that the ICC 
consider the effect of a merger ""upon adequate transportation service to the public."" This requirement has been carried forward 
without substantive change in the current law.  The relevant committee reports do not explain what Congress meant by 
""adequate transportation."" See H.R. Rep. No. 1217, 76th Cong., 1st Sess. 12 (1939); H.R. Rep. No. 2832 (Conf. Rep.), 76th 
Cong., 3d Sess. 68-69 (1940). "
931,27," These protective conditions required a merging carrier to keep open and maintain current service on all existing joint routes 
with competing carriers. They were called "" DT&I Conditions"" after the case in which they were first standardized.  Detroit,

931,28," Lamoille Valley also cites a number of cases involving proposed additional service which suggest that a minor improvement in 
quality of service is enough to make existing service inadequate.  E.g., Pennsylvania R.R. v. United States, 323 U.S. 588, 591-
93, 89 L. Ed. 478, 65 S. Ct. 543 (1945); Denver & Rio Grande W.R.R. v. Union Pac. R.R., 351 U.S. 321, 333-34, 100 L. Ed. 
1220, 76 S. Ct. 982 (1956). We find these cases of little precedential value.  The Commission can reasonably use one standard 
of adequacy when considering whether to authorize new entry into a market and a different standard in considering whether to 
allow market forces to dictate the loss of all rail service to an area."
931,29," See also Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Abandonment, Landenburg Branch, 354 I.C.C. 67, 72 (1977) (disapproving abandonment 
because of the ""serious, adverse effects"" on shippers; one major shipper would have to spend a substantial annual sum to ship 
by truck to the nearest railroad); Norfolk S. Ry. Abandonment, 282 I.C.C. 622, 625 (1952) (denying abandonment and noting that 
although affected peach growers could use trucks, ""peaches shipped by rail are salable longer . . . and they reach more distant 
markets"")."
931,30," The Commission did not reach the question whether the conditions requested by Lamoille Valley are in the public interest, but 
we have grave doubts whether they are. Essentially, Lamoille Valley has asked the Commission to award it a new and profitable 
route so that it can use the profits to subsidize losses on its existing route. That request appears to violate HN18[
] the "
932,," Commission's policy against ""subsidiz[ing] carriers who are no longer able to compete efficiently in the marketplace."" 49 C.F.R. § 
1180.1(d)(1) (1982) (quoted in full in note 8 supra). We cannot say that this policy is unreasonable in light of the congressional 
directive in the Staggers Rail Act, 49 U.S.C. § 10,101a(5), to ""foster sound economic conditions in transportation."" Accord 
Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees v. ICC, 698 F.2d 315, 319 (7th Cir. 1983) (""establishment of the 'procompetitive' 
policy disfavoring [protective] conditions falls squarely within the discretion of the Commission in exercising its regulatory 
expertise""). Nevertheless, it is not our place to decide what the ICC will do.  Moreover, the ICC has the authority to impose conditions other 
than those initially suggested by Lamoille Valley.  See notes 54-55 infra and accompanying text."
932,31," In light of this disposition, we do not reach Lamoille Valley's claim that even if the ICC may use a ""business termination"" test to 
measure the adequacy of alternate service, such a test is a major departure from prior policy for which the Commission failed to 
give a reasoned explanation.  See Missouri-Kan.-Tex. R.R. v. United States, 632 F.2d 392, 403 (5th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 451 
U.S. 1017, 101 S. Ct. 3004, 69 L. Ed. 2d 388 (1981). We likewise do not reach Lamoille Valley's claim that the Commission did 
not give Lamoille Valley advance notice of the new test.  See Norfolk & W. Ry. v. United States, 639 F.2d 1096, 1099 (4th Cir. 
1981). Finally, we do not need to reach Lamoille Valley's challenge to the adequacy of Guilford's study of traffic diversion in light 
of the Commission's conclusion that, even using Guilford's diversion estimates, Lamoille Valley would suffer ""devastating"" 
revenue losses."
932,32, Lamoille Valley Brief at 41-44; Lamoille Valley Reply Brief at 9-13. 
933,33," The ICC's assertion that the Maine Central and the Boston & Maine do not operate any ""parallel lines"" may be true in a narrow 
geometric sense, since the Maine Central's Mountain Division line (which carries traffic northwest) and the Boston & Maine's 
east-west line (which carries traffic southwest and then west) diverge at a 90 deg. angle.  The significant question, however, is 
whether the two lines compete for the same traffic, not whether they appear parallel on a map."
933,34," There is also a problem with Lamoille Valley's requested relief. We do not see, and Lamoille Valley has not explained, how 
Lamoille Valley's purchase of some Boston & Maine track will cure the loss of competition between the Maine Central and the 
Boston & Maine.  The Commission ""will not impose"" conditions on a merger because of anticompetitive effects unless the 
conditions ""will ameliorate or eliminate the harmful effects."" Union Pacific -- Control -- Missouri Pacific, supra note 21, 366 
I.C.C. at 565. Thus, whatever the competitive harm from the Maine Central/Boston & Maine merger, Lamoille Valley would not 
seem to be entitled to the relief it seeks."
933,35," In addition to its east-west service, Canadian National operates joint north-south service with the Boston & Maine from 
Montreal to New York.  Canadian National was concerned that Guilford would concentrate its efforts on east-west traffic and 
allow its north-south service to deteriorate.  It therefore requested trackage rights over the Boston & Maine's portion of the north-
south line.  The ICC denied this request as based on ""unsubstantiated fears"" of reduced service.  Boston & Maine Merger, 366 
I.C.C. at 352. It is unclear whether Canadian National presses this request on appeal.  It mentions the issue, see Canadian National Brief at 
14-15, but advances no reasons why the ICC's decision is wrong.  Assuming that the issue is before us, we conclude, for the "
934,," reasons given in response to a similar claim in Central Vermont Railway v. ICC, supra note 1, 711 F.2d at 300, that any possible 
deterioration will not affect essential services. Deterioration of the Boston & Maine's north-south service is also an essential component of Providence & Worcester's 
explanation of why it needs protective conditions.  Since downgrading will not affect essential services, we affirm the 
Commission's denial of Providence & Worcester's request for conditions."
934,36," Guilford's subsequent acquisition of the Delaware & Hudson, which extends the Boston & Maine's east-west route further 
west, increases Guilford's incentive to divert traffic from the Canadian National to the Boston & Maine/Delaware & Hudson line.  
Canadian National accordingly repeated its request for conditions in the Delaware & Hudson merger decision.  See Delaware & 
Hudson Merger, supra note 1, 366 I.C.C. at 419. The ICC denied the request, relying on the reasons it gave in its Boston & 
Maine decision. Our analysis of the Commission's reasoning applies equally to both decisions, and is incorporated by reference 
in the companion case to this one reviewing the Delaware & Hudson merger. See Central Vermont Railway v. ICC, supra note 1, 
229 U.S. App. D.C. 53, 711 F.2d 331, slip op at 6-7."

than one-half percent of its gross revenues"").  See also Union Pacific -- Control -- Missouri Pacific, supra note 21, 366 I.C.C. at

937,50," In Union Pacific -- Control -- Missouri Pacific, supra note 21, 366 I.C.C. at 528-29 & n.71, the Commission discussed the role 
of such ""source competition"" in limiting the anticompetitive effects of a railroad merger but placed little weight on this factor. "
938,51," Giving Guilford a larger share of joint revenues may not even preserve fast service in the short run.  As the Commission 
recently recognized in its Rulemaking Concerning Traffic Protective Conditions, supra note 27, 366 I.C.C. at 125-26, a 
competing carrier who participates in an efficient joint route (i.e., Canadian National) may be unable to pay enough to persuade 
the other participating carrier (i.e., Guilford) to prefer a joint route over the other carrier's less efficient single-line route. The 
record is silent on whether Canadian National can offer enough to persuade Guilford to maintain current interchange service."
938,52," Technically, we have addressed, as did the Commission, only the probability that protective conditions will be needed and not 
the amount of public benefit from preserving Canadian National's service.  There is little doubt, however, that the amount of 
benefit is substantial.  There are now three competing railroads in the Maine-to-midwest corridor: Guilford, Canadian National, 
and Canadian Pacific.  If Canadian National withdraws from the competition because of losses on its Grand Trunk Eastern line, 
only two competitors will be left.  The ICC has recently held in reviewing another merger that loss of one of three existing "
939,," competitors is ""a substantial lessening of competition."" Union Pacific -- Control -- Missouri Pacific, supra note 21, at 531.  We do 
not see why a different result would obtain here. Moreover, Canadian National's route is more efficient -- in time, energy use, and switching costs -- than the Boston & Maine 
route. Unless the difference in efficiency is minor, the public interest supports preserving the more efficient route. See United 
States v. Lowden, 308 U.S. 225, 230, 84 L. Ed. 208, 60 S. Ct. 248 (1939) (""the term public interest . . . 'has direct relation to

interest."")."
939,53," Canadian National objects that it did request rate conditions.  Canadian National Brief at 67-68.  We do not address the 
possible need for rate conditions at this time.  Our discussion is limited, as was the Commission's, to Canadian National's less 
anticompetitive request for protection against service changes.  On remand, Canadian National may renew its request for rate 
conditions and appeal from an adverse decision by the Commission."

for two years to give carriers ""time to adjust to the new competitive climate"")."
940,57," In light of this disposition, we do not reach Lamoille Valley's claim that the ICC imposed an undue burden of proof on railroads 
seeking protective conditions.  It is implicit in our analysis, however, that HN23[
] if the Commission imposes too heavy a 
burden on competing railroads to prove the need for protective conditions, a reviewing court may find that the Commission has 
neither met its affirmative duty to determine whether the unconditioned merger is consistent with the public interest nor 
developed substantial evidence to support its conclusions.  Cf.  ICC v. J-T Transp. Co., 368 U.S. 81, 89-90, 82 S. Ct. 204, 7 L. 
Ed. 2d 147 (1961): Had the Commission, having drawn out and crystallized the [] competing interests [of railroads and shippers], attempted to 
judge them with as much delicacy as the prospective nature of the inquiry permits, we should have been cautious about 
disturbing its conclusion. But . . . we are under no compulsion to accept its reading where, as here, we are convinced that it has loaded one of the 
scales. . . .  By assigning to the applicants the burden of proving the inadequacy of existing services, the Commission 
[improperly] favored the interests [of competing carriers] at the expense of the shippers' . . . . "
941,58," We see no need to provide any protection for Canadian National pending the ICC's reconsideration.  Guilford is unlikely to 
downgrade interchange service while the Commission is still considering the need for protective conditions."
941,59," See generally New York Dock Ry. v. United States, 609 F.2d 83, 86-90 (2d Cir. 1979) (reviewing at length the development of

942,," Pennsylvania R.R. -- Merger -- New York Cent. R.R., 347 I.C.C. 536, 546 (1974), cited by Lamoille Valley, is not to the contrary, 
despite the ICC's use of certain broad language.  The Commission there construed the predecessor to § 11,347 to cover 
employees of wholly-owned subsidiaries of the merging railroads. It had no occasion to address the status of employees of 
independent railroads."
942,61," The 4R Act, supra note 5, § 402(a), 90 Stat. at 62, added the requirement that labor protective conditions be ""no less 
protective of the interests of employees than those heretofore imposed pursuant to this [section]."" Section 402(a) was a last-
minute addition to the statute, and there is no legislative history dealing with it.  See New York Dock Ry. v. United States, 609 
F.2d 83, 93 (2d Cir. 1979). This provision was rephrased to its present form without substantive change in the 1978 
recodification of the Interstate Commerce Act. See 49 U.S.C. note preceding § 10,101 (no substantive change intended); id. § 
11,347 revision note (explaining wording changes)."

Local Lodge No. 693-E v. Burlington N., Inc., 319 F. Supp. 451, 453-54 (D. Minn. 1970) (following Soo Line). Railway Labor Executives' Ass'n v. United States (RLEA 1st), 216 F. Supp. 101 (E.D. Va. 1963) (3-judge court), cited by 
Lamoille Valley, is distinguishable.  It involved a joint facility run by a merging railroad and a non-merging railroad. The court held 
that employees working at the facility, who were nominally employees of the non-merging railroad but in fact worked for both 
railroads, were entitled to protection.  See id. at 103. A year later, the same court, including two of the three judges that decided 
RLEA 1st, upheld the ICC's refusal generally to protect employees of non-merging railroads in RLEA 2d."
942,63," HN27[
] The broad definition of control in 49 U.S.C. § 10,102(7) includes indirect control such as that enjoyed by Mr. Mellon: "
943,," ""control"" . . . includes actual control, legal control, and the power to exercise control, through or by (A) common directors, 
officers, stockholders, a voting trust, or a holding or investment company, or (B) any other means."
943,64," ICC Chairman Taylor, concurring, believed that § 11,343 required joinder, but agreed that ""this issue has no effect on the 
merits"" because Mr. Mellon's personal finances were not relevant to the Commission's decision.  Boston & Maine Merger, 366 
I.C.C. at 358 (Taylor, Chmn., concurring)."
943,65," The predecessor to § 11,343, 49 U.S.C. § 5(5) (1976) (which § 11,343 ""restates without substantive change""; see 49 U.S.C. 
note preceding § 10,101) is even more explicit: It shall be unlawful for any person, except . . . [with the approval and authorization of the Commission], to accomplish or 
effectuate . . . the control or management in a common interest of any two or more carriers, however such result is attained, 
whether directly or indirectly, by use of common directors, officers, or stockholders, a holding or investment company or 
companies, a voting trust or trusts, or in any other manner whatsoever."
943,66," It is possible to distinguish Marshall Transport as not involving an explicit ICC finding that joinder would serve no useful 
purpose.  The ICC, however, fails in its broader attempt to distinguish Marshall Transport as merely affirming the Commission's 
discretionary power to require appropriate persons to join a control application.  Marshall Transport addresses both whether the 
Commission may require Union to join the control application, see 322 U.S. at 36-40, and whether the Commission must do so, 
see id. at 40-42. The Court's affirmative answer to the second issue was necessary to its decision because the full Commission 
had overruled its own division on that basis."
943,67," It appears that Mr. Mellon did not join the control application in order not to disclose his personal finances.  See Boston & 
Maine Merger, 366 I.C.C. at 325. As noted in text, however, Mr. Mellon could have asked the Commission to exempt him from 
its jurisdiction under 49 U.S.C. § 10,505(a).  Moreover, he may not have had to answer questions about his finances even if he "
944,," remained as an applicant.  See 366 I.C.C. at 325 n.22 (""even if Mr. Mellon were to join as an applicant, he would only be 
required to file an affidavit stating that he joins in [Guilford's] application"")."
944,68," The ICC's possible lack of ""authority"" to approve the merger without joinder of Mr. Mellon does not foreclose a finding of 
harmless error because that lack is ""not strictly jurisdictional in the sense that if the Commission wrongly decides that [Mr. Mellon 
does not need to join the application], the Commission loses jurisdiction over [Guilford]."" Alleghany Corp. v. Breswick & Co., 353

discretion in consolidating consideration of the reorganization plan with consideration of the merger proposal.  The proceedings 
were clearly ""interdependent."" Boston & Maine Merger, 366 I.C.C. at 330. Nor did the Commission abuse its discretion in failing to consolidate Guilford's later-filed application to control the Delaware &

proper forum for considering cumulative impacts and crossover effects [due to multiple transactions] is in a later proceeding."" 49 
C.F.R. § 1180.1(g) (1982).  Moreover, since the Commission was bound to decide the Boston & Maine application within 180

967,2," Both Royal Drug and Pireno are antitrust cases, as have been most cases discussing the ""business of insurance"" exemption. It 
is possible that more leniency should be inferred in applying the ""business of insurance"" exemption to non-antitrust cases, as the 
courts have held that antitrust exemptions must be narrowly construed; Royal Drug, supra, 440 U.S. at 231; see also, Schwartz 
v. Commonwealth Land Title Co., 374 F. Supp. 564, 573 (E.D.Pa. 1974), while no like requirement exists for applications of the 
""business of insurance"" to cases such as this one.  However, the statutory language of 15 U.S.C. § 1012(b) (the Act) does not 
distinguish the two situations, and it has been recognized that the law has a wider scope than antitrust. Cochran v. Paco, 606 
F.2d 460, 463 (5th Cir. 1979). Therefore, the Supreme Court criteria developed in the antitrust cases will be applied here, 
keeping in mind that the tests were developed in a slightly different context.  But see, Thompson v. NYL Ins. Co., 644 F.2d 439

denied, 450 U.S. 912 (1981). We should clarify, however, that an affirmative action which, from a constitutional point of view, represents a minimum contact 
between a nonresident and our jurisdiction is not per se sufficient to authorize our courts to exercise their jurisdiction if said 
action cannot be framed within any of the circumstances described in Rule 4.7 of the Rules of Civil Procedure. For it to be 
otherwise it would be necessary to adopt a statute like the California statute which reads: "
976,," ""A court of this state may exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent with the Constitution of this state or of the 
United States."" Cal. Code Civ. Proc., sec. 410.10 (West 1973); see, M. Green, Jurisdictional Reform in"" California, 21 
Hastings L. J. 1219 (1970). This norm would, however, be much more difficult to apply, and while Rule 4.7 is left unamended to that effect, the initial query 
should always be to determine if the conduct attributed to the nonresident defendant is comprised within its provisions. See, 
World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 289-290 (1980)."
976,6," It is not necessary at this time to place Puerto Rico within the North American federal scheme. For purposes of the discussion

exercised our jurisdiction on the ground that the minor's mother, that is, the plaintiff, was a resident of Puerto Rico. Nonetheless, 
this decision should be reexamined in the light of what was later decided by the United States Supreme Court in Kulko v. 
California Superior Court, 436 U.S. 84 (1978), and by our own decision in Perron v. Corretjer, 113 D.P.R. 593 (1982). "

986,5, Argon must be processed further to raise its purity level to commercial standards. 
987,6," The price paid by distributors for such liquid product is known as the ""recompression"" price."
987,7," Not all distributors fit this mold.  Some purchase for resale cylinders that have already been filled with gas by the defendants.  
Others purchase liquid product and resell it as such, either in cylinder or bulk form.  Defendants' affidavits indicate that 
distributors consummate a large percentage of the liquid cylinder and small-volume bulk liquid sales that are made.  In their 
briefs, however, defendants stress only the influence of the distributors in the cylinder gas end of the market."
987,8," Defendants also run a few distributorships on their own.  These distributorships are operated in the same manner as their 
independent counterparts. "
988,9," The statement in the text evidences the interrelationship between the alleged conspiracies to raise price schedules and allocate 
customers. The two alleged wrongs are, however, conceptually distinct. See infra. "
990,10," In general, a claim under section 4 of the Clayton Act ""arises before"" a specific date when the conduct causing the damage 
occurs prior thereto. See Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 401 U.S. 321, 338-42, 28 L. Ed. 2d 77, 91 S. Ct. 795 
(1971). "
991,11," The court has no quarrel with the proposition that ""care must be taken not to convert the preliminary consideration of whether 
the [predomination] requirement of Rule 23(b)(3) has been satisfied into a predetermination on the merits.  Rather, if plaintiffs' 
assertion of class status is at least colorable, the court should allow the action to proceed under Rule 23."" 7A C. Wright & A. 
Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, § 1781, p. 84 (1972) (emphasis added).  The court understands that there are reasons 
to restrict the intensity of its scrutiny.  See infra. The discussion in the text is intended solely to rebut plaintiff's overbroad 
contention that no scrutiny whatsoever is permissible. "
992,12," The Court also finds it noteworthy that the Eisen ""ban"" on inquiries into the merits has often been justified on rationales 
sensitive to the rights of class opponents. Thus, in Eisen itself, the Court was worried ""that a preliminary determination of the 
merits may result in substantial prejudice to a defendant, since of necessity it is not accompanied by the traditional rules and 
procedures applicable to civil trials.  The court's tentative findings, made in the absence of established safeguards, may color the 
subsequent proceedings and place an unfair burden on the defendant."" Id., 417 U.S. at 178. It has also been suggested that the 
Eisen ""rule"" is needed to protect class opponents from de facto ""one-way intervention."" See Peritz v. Liberty Loan Corporation, 
523 F.2d 349, 353-54 (7th Cir. 1975); see also Jimenez v. Weinberger, 523 F.2d 689, 698, 700 (7th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 427 
U.S. 912, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1204, 96 S. Ct. 3200 (1976). Plaintiffs' subsidiary contention is that the court should abstain from all scrutiny of plaintiffs' proposed methods of proof since 
class determinations must be made ""as soon as practicable after the commencement of an action brought as a class action,"" 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1), and thus prior to discovery.  But the propriety of pre-certification discovery is now firmly established.  
Eggleston v. Chicago Journeymen Plumbers, 657 F.2d 890, 895 (7th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 1017, 102 S. Ct. 1710, 
72 L. Ed. 2d 134 (1982). If plaintiffs have failed to obtain the information they need to construct methods of proof capable of 
withstanding the limited form of scrutiny employed here, they have no one to blame but themselves.  See also Pointer, ""The 
Judge's Viewpoint on Issues and Problems Arising in Antitrust Class Actions,"" 49 Antitrust L.J. 1581, 1583 (1980)."
992,13," Indeed, the Simer Court rejected the idea that common questions ""predominate"" only when ""the total time spent trying 
common issues would be greater than time spent on trial of individual issues."" Id., 661 F.2d at 672. The Court believed that this 
approach ""would unduly block class actions from going forward because only the most complex of common questions would 
require more litigation time than a series of individual trials."" Id. When these statements are read in conjunction with those 
reprinted in the text, it becomes apparent that a class action may go forward even if individual trials are necessary, and even if 
these trials will take more time to resolve than the common questions, provided that in an absolute sense the individual trials do 
not render the class action unduly burdensome on the court and parties.  Thus, if the class is relatively small, or if the individual 
trials are particularly easy to resolve, certification of the class would seem appropriate."
992,14," There are undoubtedly situations in which a ""manageable"" class action, containing common questions that ""predominate,"" 
might not be ""superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy."" In light of the ultimate 
conclusion reached herein, the court need not explore this possibility. "
993,15," There is one qualification to this general statement.  Defendants do challenge Dr. Peltzman's internal logic to the extent he 
believes that defendants' behavior inflated the prices charged end-users of cylinder gas.  Defendants argue that they controlled 
such a small share of this sub-market, see supra, that their alleged activities could not possibly have affected cylinder prices, 
notwithstanding their control of over 80% of the overall market.  See In re Electric Weld Steel Tubing Antitrust Litigation, [1980- "
994,81," ] TRADE CASES (CCH) P63,783 (E.D. Pa. 1980), at 78,182-83.  Plaintiffs counter that ""the character and effect of a 
conspiracy are not to be judged by dismembering it and viewing its separate parts, but only by looking at it as a whole."" 
Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 699, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777, 82 S. Ct. 1404 (1962) (quoting 
American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 147 F.2d 93, 106 (6th Cir. 1944)). Plaintiffs further argue that ""conspirators controlling a 
seemingly small percentage of the market can through an effective conspiracy cause classwide impact.  If the conspirators are 
the largest producers and the price leaders, their price leadership can cause their conspiracy to have market wide impact."" 
(Plaintiffs' Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion for Class Certification at 75 n. 26) What is missing from this response, 
however, is an indication of how, or even whether, plaintiffs intend to prove at trial that ""price leadership"" was present, or that the 
merchant market was so interrelated that the ""conspiracy as a whole"" must have influenced the gas cylinder sub-portion.  In light 
of the court's ultimate holding, this point need not be pressed further.  Plaintiffs should be aware, though, that, in light of the 
present record, the court might not have included merchant purchasers of cylinder gas in the class had one been certified at all."
994,16," These studies detail the percentage of prices in a given universe that, over various periods of time, either decreased, 
remained unchanged, or increased less than the full amount of the applicable schedule increases. "
995,17, See Madansky Aff. at para. 9.
995,18," Defendants' more powerful argument on the ""benchmark"" question is that no price schedules existed for various types of 
sales.  Were a class otherwise certifiable, the court might have refined its definition accordingly.  See generally note 15, supra. "
996,19," Assuming that the burden of showing the absence of due diligence is in fact properly placed upon defendants, this burden 
differs significantly from that faced by defendants in attempting to refute plaintiffs' proposed proof of impact.  For the reasons 
already given, defendants could successfully negate plaintiffs' allegation of class-wide impact with a limited number of showings 
to the contrary.  By contrast, an equally limited number of demonstrations of no due diligence would have relevance only for the 
class members in question.  In order to prevail on the question of due diligence against all pertinent members of the class, 
defendants would have to offer separate proof with respect to each relevant purchaser's knowledge."
996,20," The need to engage in individualized examinations of due diligence will not appreciably extend the litigation if complicated 
damage assessments must in any event be made.  See In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litigation, 82 F.R.D. 143, 155 (E.D. Pa. 1979); 
In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litigation, 80 F.R.D. 244, 248 (S.D. Tx. 1978); In re Plywood Antitrust Litigation, 76 F.R.D. 
570, 586 (E.D. La. 1976). "
997,21," An example may help clarify the formula plaintiffs have in mind.  Assume that during 1978 the average FOB price for all liquid 
oxygen sold in the merchant market was 10 cents per 100 cubic feet, and that the swap price for the same product and time 
period was 7 cents per 100 cubic feet. Assume further that during 1979, the relevant figures (again with reference to liquid 
oxygen) were 12 cents per 100 cubic feet (average FOB merchant) and 8 cents per 100 cubic feet (swap).  Under plaintiffs' 
approach, the uniform overcharge figure governing 1978 would be 3 cents per 100 cubic feet (the difference between 10 and 7); 
the 1979 figure would be 4 cents per 100 cubic feet (the difference between 12 and 8). Assume further that customer A purchased 400 cubic feet of liquid oxygen during 1978 at 12 cents per 100 cubic feet, and that 
customer B purchased 400 cubic feet of liquid oxygen during the same year at 10 cents per 100 cubic feet. Finally, assume that 
in 1979 customer A again bought 400 cubic feet at 12 cents per 100 cubic feet. Under plaintiffs' methodology, customer A would thus be entitled to damages equalling 12 cents (400 cubic feet times 3 cents 
per 100 cubic feet) for his purchases during 1978, and to 16 cents (400 cubic feet times 4 cents per 100 cubic feet) for his 
purchases in 1979.  Customer B would receive 12 cents (400 cubic feet times 3 cents per 100 cubic feet) for his 1978 
transactions. Note that customers A and B receive the exact same award for their 1978 purchases even though they paid varying amounts in 
the merchant market.  This equality results from the fact they both purchased the same amount of product, and from the fact that 
plaintiffs' formula rests on a belief that each contemporaneous sale in the merchant market was influenced by defendants' illegal 
activities to the same extent (i.e., 3 cents per 100 cubic feet in 1978).  In other words, under plaintiffs' assumptions, customer A 
would have paid--in the absence of defendants' conspiratorial behavior--9 cents per 100 cubic feet in 1978, and customer B 
would have paid 7 cents per 100 cubic feet. See infra. "
999,22," Although a private claimant under the antitrust laws need only quantify the extent of his injury with reasonable approximation, 
see, e.g., Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co., 282 U.S. 555, 566, 75 L. Ed. 544, 51 S. Ct. 248 (1931), such 
approximation must relate to the injury felt by that claimant.  See, e.g., Windham v. American Brands, Inc., supra, 565 F.2d at 
66; Kline v. Coldwell, Banker & Co., 508 F.2d 226, 236 n. 8 (9th Cir. 1974); In re Hotel Telephone Charges, 500 F.2d 86, 90 (9th 
Cir. 1974); Al Barnett & Son, Inc. v. Outboard Marine Corporation, 64 F.R.D. 43, 54-55 (D. Del. 1974); Landers, Of Legalized 
Blackmail and Legalized Theft: Consumer Class Actions and the Substance-Procedure Dilemma, 47 So. Cal. Rev. 842, 869-70 
(1974); Handler, Twenty-Fourth Annual Antitrust Review, 72 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 37 (1972)."
999,23," It is conceivable that the overcharges might differ, but within a range small enough that the common number generated by the 
swap price method would be a sufficiently reasonable approximation of each.  See generally note 22, supra. Alternatively, the 
overcharges might differ greatly, but each might be smaller than the swap price number.  In that case, the inaccuracies in 
plaintiffs' method would redound to defendants' advantage.  Neither of these possibilities have been suggested or advocated by 
plaintiffs."
999,24," Cf.  In re Master Key Antitrust Litigation, 70 F.R.D. 23, 26 (D. Conn.), appeal dismissed, 528 F.2d 5 (2d Cir. 1975) (""in few 
class actions is there a simple per capita measure of recovery."")."
999,25," The present situation thus differs greatly from what was observed on the fact of damage issue, where it was evident that 
plaintiffs intended to offer common proof supporting Dr. Peltzman's ""assumptions."" See supra. The record before the court offers 
no such assurance with respect to the presumption of uniform impact."
999,26," Plaintiffs' alternative damage theory is based upon the post-conspiracy decrease in merchant prices.  It suffers from an 
identical infirmity since it is similarly designed to generate a common overcharge figure.  See Transcript of December 3, 1982 
hearing at 50. "
1000,27," See Peltzman 2d Aff. at paras. 4, 8."
1000,28," Of course, even if defendants' economic logic were correct, swap prices might coincidentally equal or exceed average 
marginal costs.  The determination of such a coincidental relationship would, however, require an initial calculation of each 
relevant marginal cost, and the manageability problems the swap price method was designed to cure would thus resurface. "
1001,29," Defendants have argued that swap transactions differ from merchant sales in several additional ways, and that for this reason, 
FOB merchant prices can never be meaningfully compared with swap prices.  In re Transit Company Tire Antitrust Litigation, 67 
F.R.D. 59, 76 (W.D. Mo. 1975). Dr. Peltzman has adequately answered these remaining assertions.  See Peltzman 3d Aff. at 
paras. 5-8."
1001,30," See generally Martino v. McDonald's System, Inc., 81 F.R.D. 81, 91-92 (N.D. Ill. 1979)."
1001,31," Only defendants placed evidence in the record on this question.  Plaintiffs explicitly declined to take discovery on how the 
swap prices were actually set.  See Transcript of September 2, 1981 hearing at 19."
1001,32," Other courts have rejected damage formulae proffered by class proponents. See, e.g., Moore v. Southeast Toyota, No. CV 81-
P-0491-S, slip op. at 7 (N.D. Ala. Feb. 3, 1982); Yanai v. Frito Lay, Inc., 61 F.R.D. 349, 352 (N.D. Ohio 1973); Ralston v. 
Volkswagenwerk, 61 F.R.D. 427, 432 (W.D. Mo. 1973). "
1002,33," Indeed, the courts have grafted even further limitations on this rule.  See, e.g., In re Industrial Gas Litigation, 681 F.2d 514 (7th 
Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1016, 103 S. Ct. 1261, 75 L. Ed. 2d 487, 51 U.S.L.W. 3634 (1983)."
1002,34," HN16[
] Under subsection (c)(4)(A), ""an action may be brought or maintained as a class action with respect to particular 
issues."" "
1003,35," Indeed, at least two members of this Court have relied in part upon concepts of bifurcation while certifying (b)(3) classes in the 
aftermath of Simer.  Ridings v. Canadian Imperial Bank, 94 F.R.D. 147, 151 (N.D. Ill. 1982) (Aspen, J.); Board of Education v. 
Admiral Heating, Nos. 79 C 3046, 79 C 5253 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 10, 1982) (Shadur, J.)."
1003,36," Stated otherwise, to the extent there is uncertainty as to the original panel's findings, the Gasoline Products ""rule is dictated for 
the very practical reason that if separate juries are allowed to pass on issues involving overlapping legal and factual questions 
the verdicts rendered by each jury could be inconsistent."" State of Alabama v. Blue Bird Body Co., supra, 573 F.2d at 318. "
1004,37," ""The majority believes that the dissents' discussion of [the Gasoline Products] issues is premature in this case, and on this 
procedural point we differ.  Therefore, even though some opinions are styled as dissents, their reasoning on those issues is not 
necessarily at variance with the views of a majority of this court."" Link v. Mercedes-Benz of N. Am. Inc., 550 F.2d 860, 865 n. 4 
(3d Cir.), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 933, 53 L. Ed. 2d 250, 97 S. Ct. 2641 (1977)."
1004,38," It should be apparent that this analysis is based upon considerations unique to the Clayton Act.  This opinion does not address 
the permissibility of bifurcation in other contexts, such as when violations of the federal securities laws are alleged. In must be emphasized as well that the court's discussion refers solely to cases in which inquiries into fact of damage and 
damages are completely bifurcated.  If the second jury need only determine the appropriate values to plug into a generalized 
damage formula established at the first trial, Seventh Amendment concerns disappear.  See, e.g., In re Plywood Antitrust 
Litigation, 655 F.2d 627, 636 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. granted, 456 U.S. 971, 102 S. Ct. 2232, 72 L. Ed. 2d 844, 50 U.S.L.W. 3907

1007,1, The individual plaintiff also seeks treble damages.

Judge Higginbotham dismissed the counterclaims based on the antitrust laws. See Altemose Const. v. Bldg. & Const. Trades

1010,12," Pressure exerted upon the employer with whom the union has a labor dispute is ""primary,"" and lawful; pressure exerted on a

involved. Thus, ""the often quoted general language of Poller is in itself no barrier to summary judgment."" P. Areeda & D. Turner, 
Antitrust Law § 316 at 62 (1978). Even so the case has become a ""magic wand waved indiscriminately by those opposing 
summary judgment motions in antitrust actions."" Mutual Fund Investors, Inc. v. Putnam Management Co., 553 F.2d 620, 624

plaintiffs' activities are intrastate in nature, our discussion is confined to the interstate ramifications of the restraint. The 
procedural contours and jurisdictional anomalies of the interstate commerce question are discussed in Zenith Radio Corp. v. 
Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., 494 F.Supp. 1161, 1171 n. 21 - 77 E.D. Pa. 1980) and need not be reiterated here."

Ctr., 552 F.Supp. 1170, 1203 (E.D. Pa. 1982) supports our conclusion. In Cardio-Medical, Judge Lord noted, while distinguishing 
the facts before him, that Hospital Building involved a substantial interstate commerce nexus through the interstate purchase of 
building supplies and financing. Accord, Schnabel v. Building Trades Council of Phila., Etc., C.A. No. 82-2256, Slip. Op. at 28 
(E.D. Pa. April 13, 1983). Because we have analyzed the nexus between the alleged restraint and interstate commerce and 
found that jurisdiction is established, we need not delve into the academic quandary rooted in a more liberal reading of McClain.

Norris-LaGuardia Act (29 U.S.C. §§ 104, 105, 113) which declare that labor unions are not combinations in restraint of trade and

on implied, whereby such employer ceases or refrains or agrees to cease or refrain from handling, using, selling, transporting or 
otherwise dealing in any of the products of any other employer, or to cease doing business with any other person, and any

1016,31," Both the majority opinion and the dissent in Connell apparently agreed that Congress rejected the use of antitrust sanctions to 
curb secondary union activities when it considered revising the NLRA in 1947. Compare 421 U.S. at 634 & n. 15 (Powell, J.) with 
id. at 641 (Stewart, J. dissenting). Justice Powell found that this legislative choice had no relevance to the issue whether 
Congress intended to preclude antitrust attack when hot cargo agreements were forbidden as unfair labor practices by the 
Landrum-Griffin amendments to the NLRA enacted in 1959.  29 U.S.C. § 158(e) (1976). See 421 U.S. at 634."
1016,32," The complaint alleged that the subcontractor agreement violated §§ 1 & 2 of Sherman. 421 U.S. at 620-21. Moreover, 
immediately prior to the conclusion of the opinion, the Court stated that ""the union's agreement with Connell is subject to the 
federal antitrust laws."" Id. at 635."
1016,33," This assumes that a union-employer agreement is not necessarily immune from antitrust sanctions because the union's 
unilateral action to secure it was immune. See St. Antoine, supra n. 13, at 614. "
1017,34, The Supreme Court in Connell left this question open.  421 U.S. at 684 n. 14.
1017,35," Although the Court did refer to the other agreements with general contractors and the multi-employer collective bargaining 
agreement to assess the effect on the product market, it specifically noted that Connell did not argue the case on a conspiracy 
between the union and unionized subcontractors. The Court focused exclusively on the executed agreement with Connell in its 
statement of the holding.  421 U.S. at 625 n. 2 and 635."
1017,36," As under the Clayton Act, the specified activities are protected only in the context of a labor dispute. A labor dispute is defined 
by the Norris-LaGuardia Act as including ""any controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment, or concerning the 
association or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of 
employment regardless of whether or not the disputants stand in the proximate relations of employer and employee."" 29 U.S.C. 
§ 113(c). Contrary to the arguments advanced by the plaintiffs, we have no difficulty in finding that the parties were engaged in a 
labor dispute within the meaning of § 113(c). See Marine Cooks & Stewards v. Panama Steamship Co., 362 U.S. 365 (1960); 
NLRB v. Rice Milling Co., 321 U.S. 665 (1951); Utilities Ser. Eng. v. Colo. Bldg. & Const. Trades, 549 F.2d 173, 176-77 (10th 
Cir. 1977)."
1017,37, 29 U.S.C. § 102 provides: 
1018,," Whereas under prevailing economic conditions. . . the individual unorganized worker is commonly helpless to exercise actual 
liberty or contract and to protect his freedom of labor, and thereby to obtain acceptable terms and conditions of employment, 
wherefore, though he should be free to decline to associate with his fellows, it is necessary that he have full freedom of 
association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of his own choosing, to negotiate the terms and conditions of 
his own employment, and that he shall be free from the interference, restraint, or coercion of employers of labor, or their agents, 
in the designation of such representatives or in self-organization or in other concerted activities for the purposes of collective 
bargaining or other mutual aid or protection."
1018,38," The first case to employ a species of the statutory exemption was Milk Wagon Drivers, Union Local 753 v. Lake Vallev Farm 
Products, Inc., 311 U.S. 91 (1940). There the Court noted that federal courts did not have jurisdiction to grant injunctions in 
cases involving labor disputes under the Norris-LaGuardia Act even though a secondary boycott in violation of the Sherman Act 
was alleged.  Id. at 103. In Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 60 S.Ct. 982, 84 L.Ed. 1311 (1940) the Court discussed 
the Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia Act provisions, but decided that the conduct did not violate the terms of the Sherman Act. 
Thus, it was not necessary to examine the statutory exemption. See Mid-American Reg. Bar. v. Will County Carpenter, District 
Council, 675 F.2d 881, 885 n. 11 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 103 S.Ct. 132 (1982). Apex is sometimes considered the origin of the 
non-statutory exemption because the unions' goal of the elimination of price competition based on the differences in labor 
standards was not the type of restraint in price competition prohibited by the Sherman Act. See, Conex, supra, 602 F.2d at 513-
14."

employees if another labor organization has been certified as the representative of such employees under the provisions of 
section 159 of this title; (D) forcing or requiring any employer to assign particular work to employees in a particular labor organization or in a particular 
trade, craft, or class rather than to employees in another labor organization or in another trade, craft or class, unless such

1021,62," This conclusion draws support from the overwhelming number of scholars and commentators who have examined the 
question See cf. St. Antoine, supra, n. 13 at 603; Handler & Zifchack, supra, n. 28, at 514-15, Handler, Changing Trends in

(1976). See Connell, supra, 421 U.S. at 640-44 (Stewart J., dissenting)."
1021,63," Justice Stewart persuasively argued that the sequence of events occurring during the debate of the bill reveals 
""unmistakeably"" that Congress chose with great care the labor law remedy over the antitrust remedy.  421 U.S. at 634, 651-54. "
1022,63," See Connell, 421 U.S. at 634 (""But whatever significance this legislative choice has for antitrust suits based on those 
secondary activities prohibited by § 8(b)(4), it has no relevance to the question whether Congress meant to preclude antitrust 
suits based on the 'hot cargo' agreements outlawed in 1959."")."
1022,64," See Connell, supra, 421 U.S. at 634 n. 16."
1022,65," Because plaintiffs attack the subcontracting agreements in general as violative of the labor and antitrust laws, the discussion 
of the collective bargaining relationship created by the agreements under § 8(f) applies to the association plaintiffs as well. See 
infra at n. 82 and accompanying text. But since the association plaintiffs do not have standing to contest union conduct taken 
against individual member contractors, only the history of the labor dispute with Altemose is pertinent in determining whether a 
sufficient collective bargaining context existed to satisfy the criteria of Connell. "
1023,66," In Connell it is arguable from a reading of the Court's opinion that the antitrust exemption did not turn on the validity of the 
agreement under § 8(e) because the Court first addressed the exemption question and then proceeded to determine the validity 
of the agreement under the labor laws. See Casey, supra n. 28, at 256 n. 117 (suggesting that the Court would have found no 
exemption regardless of the outcome of the § 8(e) issue). Whatever academic significance this may have has been laid to rest in 
Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Mullins!  U.S. , 102 S.Ct. 851 (1982). The Court explaining the Connell mode of analysis stated ""[W]e 
addressed the § 8(e) issue on the merits and found that § 8(e) did not allow the agreement at issue . . . . [A]s a result, the 
agreement was subject to the antitrust laws Id. at 860. In summary the Court went on ""In Connell we decided the § 8(e) issue in 
the first instance. It was necessary to do so to determine whether the agreement was immune from the antitrust laws."" Id."
1023,67," In Conex, supra, the court stated that a § 8(e) violation automatically precludes recognition of non-statutory immunity.  602 
F.2d at 518-19. But in Muko I the court retreated from this view suggesting that a § 8(e) violation does not necessarily lead to a 
finding of non-exemption.  Muko I, supra, 609 F.2d at 1375. And the court reserved judgment on the effect of a § 8(e) violation 
standing alone. See discussion Areeda & Turner, supra n.14, at 82-84."
1023,68," See Sullivan, supra n.27, at 730. Casey, supra n. 28, at 272-75. See also, Berman Enterprises v. Local 333, 644 F.2d 930,

was ""not conclusive on the issue of their illegality under the antitrust laws."" Conex, supra, 602 F.2d at 519 (quoting Heat 
Insulators v. United Contractors, 494 F.2d 1353, 1354 (3rd Cir. 1974). We view this language appropriate in the context of 
executed collective bargaining agreements which were at issue in Conex. See Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co., supra, 381 U.S. 
676."
1023,69," United Brotherhood of Carpenters v. NLRB, 357 U.S. 93 (1958). Sand Door was widely interpreted as permitting voluntary ""hot 
cargo"" agreements. See supra n. 53."
1023,70," It must be remembered that § 8(e) with its construction industry proviso was added to the Act by the 1959 Landrum-Griffin 
Amendments, P.L. 86-257, 23 Stat. 543-544. For the text of 29 U.S.C. § 158(e), see supra at n. 31."
1023,71," The unique nature of the construction industry is summarized in the Senate Report: The occasional nature of the employment relationship makes this industry markedly different from manufacturing and other types 
of enterprise. An individual employed typically works for many employers and for none of them continuously. Jobs are frequently 
of short duration, depending upon various stages of construction. S.Rep. No. 187, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 27, (1959) U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News, pp. 2318, 2344; I Legislative History of the 
Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 423. With its enactment, Congress necessarily chose to tolerate a 
degree of ""top down"" pressure for unionization. See Woelke Romero , supra, 102 S.Ct. at 2081-82. But the ""top down"" 
organizing effect of subcontractor agreements is limited by other provisions of the NLRA when sought in the collective 
bargaining context. Id. See gen., 29 U.S.C. § 158(B)(7)(c); 29 U.S.C. § 158(f). "
1024,72," As previously noted, the Connell decision hinged on the absence of a collective bargaining relationship between the union and 
the general contractor. A number of courts have limited Connell to the proposition that a hot cargo agreement, if an unfair labor 
practice because secured outside of the collective bargaining practice, may be the basis of an antitrust suit. See Gorgan v. 
Swanson Painting Co., 682 F.2d 807 (9th Cir. 1982); Donald Schriver Inc. v. NLRB, 635 F.2d 859 (D.C.Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 
451 U.S. 976 (1981). The NLRB general counsel has also taken this position regarding § 8(e). See NLRB Guidelines for 
handling § 8(e) Construction Industry Proviso Cases under the Supreme Court's Connell Decision; 9105 CCH Labor Law

1024,77," 222 NLRB No. 198 aff'd mem., 93 LRRM 3025 (3rd Cir. 1976). Moreover, in related cases which are referred to by the 
plaintiffs the Board found organizational objectives in the picketing. In Samnoff v. Building Construction Trades Council , 346 
F.Supp. 1071 (E.D. Pa. 1972), rev. on other grounds, 425 F.2d 203 (3rd Cir.), vacated, 414 U.S. 808 (1973), the Board on 
remand found the picketing violative of § 8(b)(7)(c) because of its recognitional object. See 201 NLRB No. 42 at 203, aff'd mem., 
485 F.2d 680 (3rd Cir. 1973). See e.g., Danielson v. I.G.W., 494 F.2d 1230, 1239 (2nd Cir. 1974) (explaining the subsequent 
history of Samnoff); Samuel Long, Inc., 201 NLRB No. 42 at 203 (finding of recognitional objective); Hirch v. Building & Const. 
Trades Council, Etc., 530 F.2d 298, 304 (3rd Cir. 1976) (finding of organizational purpose)."
1024,78," In Conex, supra, 602 F.2d at 503, 511, the court held that a prior judgment of the NLRB was entitled to preclusive effect as to 
all labor law issues in an antitrust action. Accordingly, the rule of collateral estoppel is applicable to prior administrative 
proceedings involving these parties, and the adjudicative facts are treated as undisputed for the purpose of this opinion. See 
United States v. Utah Const. and Minino Co., 384 U.S. 394, 422 (1966). The plaintiffs do not contend that these administrative 
proceedings were inadequate to fairly present their claims. See Nasem v. Brown, 595 F.2d 801, 806-07 ( D.C. Cir. 1979); Jaden 
Elec. v. Int'l. Broth., Etc., 508 F.Supp. 983, 988 (D.N.J. 1981)."
1024,79," Furthermore, Form 3 which was then in effect does not prohibit subcontracting to non-union firms as did the agreement in 
Connell; it has an ancillary purpose to organize the general contractor's employees. Any antitrust claim based on Form 3 is 
without merit. "
1025,," The unions here at the time of the picketing denied any organizational objective. The unions wanted to picket Altemose as long 
as they could and § 8(b)(7) limits this right to thirty days. Antitrust consequences from lack of organizational intent in mass 
picketing was inconceivable in 1972. Subcontracting agreements in the construction trade had been upheld by the courts on 
numerous occasions even in the absence of a collective bargaining relationship. See Suburban Tile Center, Inc. v. Rockford 
Bldg. Trades Council, 354 F.2d 1 (7th Cir.) cert. denied, 384 U.S. 960 (1966); Construction Laborers Local 383 v. NLRB, 323

151 N.L.R.B. 413 (1965). Not until the Fifth Circuit's consideration of Connell had the issue of whether a collective bargaining 
relationship was required arisen.  Connell, supra, 483 F.2d at 1173-74. See also, Samnof'f, supra, 346 F.Supp. 1071 (E.D. 
Pa.), rev'd on other grounds, 475 F.2d 203 (3rd Cir. 1973) (Becker, J., picketing to obtain subcontracting agreement legal even 
absent organizational purpose) (Citing Essex County Dist. Coun. of Carpenters, Etc. v. NLRB, 332 F.2d 636 (3rd Cir. 1964)."
1025,80, See supra at n. 77. It does not appear in the record why Altemose did not resort to a § 8(b)(7) remedy in 1972. 
1026,81," The reference to § 8(b) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 is a misnomer (Representation-elections). We believe 
the intent was to refer to 29 U.S.C. § 159. Section 8(b), 29 U.S.C. § ?158(b) merely refers to unfair union labor practices. "

assertions of unlawfulness under § 1 of the Sherman Act is without merit. "
1028,89," In Allen Bradley, the plaintiffs were non-New York City manufacturers of electrical equipment. The defendant was the local 
union representing electrical workers in the New York City. The plaintiffs challenged industry wide agreements negotiated by the 
union which provided that contractors would purchase equipment only the city electrical manufacturers and the manufacturer 
would sell only to contained these agreements by using labor union methods, such as strikes and boycotts. The effect of these 
closed shop and hot cargo agreements was to establish a market closed to competition from out-of-state manufacturers. The 
Court noted that the evidence of conspiracy extended beyond closed shop and hot cargo restraints imposed in the collective 
bargaining agreements which ""standing alone would not have violated the Sherman Act."" 325 U.S. at 809."

1029,92," Although the discussion of the permissible inferences from evidence was made in the context of appeal from a directed 
verdict, it is equally applicable to a motion for summary judgment. See Zenith Radio, supra, 513 F.Supp. at 1171 (""'Mere 
speculation', in the form of an inference which is not supported by logic, is not sufficient to withstand a motion for summary 
judgment."") (Footnote omitted)."
1029,92," See Leslie, Principles of Labor Antitrust, 66 Va. L. Rev. 1183, 1183-88 (1980)."
1029,93," The antitrust implications of this type of conduct are obvious. Where the unions seek to limit the number of firms in the product 
market by creating barriers to entry, a predatory purpose to erect and enforce a cartel of particular firms in the product market 
may be inferred. In this manner the employer cartel could regulate prices and outputs, while the union policed the arrangement 
to protect the dominant position of the cartel. See Leslie, supra n.93, 1190-92. This was the effect of the arrangement 
condemned in Allen Bradley. "
1030,94," There are no antitrust consequences from the fact that the union tactics included violence directed at Altemose and other 
subcontractors since the Sherman Act ""draws no distinction between restraints effected by violence and those achieved by 
peaceful means,"" Apex Hosiery; supra, 310 U.S. at 513. To the extent that Altemose Const. Co. v. Atlantic Cape May, Etc., 493 
F.Supp. 1181, 1188 (D.N.J. 1980), differs with this conclusion, we note that its disregard of Apex Hosiery is at odds with its 
subsequent citation with approval by the Court in Allen Bradley, supra, 325 U.S. at 810.' See also, Schnabel v. Building & Const. 
Trades Council of Phila., Etc., supra, at 45. "

1041,3," We depart from the standards under section 1 to the extent necessary to evaluate the conduct of a single firm that would 
escape liability under section 1 because of that section's limitation to concerted or contractual activity.  When, as here, the 
plaintiff challenges concerted activity, and we hold that the conduct does not amount to a substantial claim of restraint of trade 
under section 1, our holding precludes us from finding that the conduct is the type of conduct necessary to support an inference 
of the other two elements of an attempted monopolization claim under section 2.  See Foremost Pro Color, Inc. v. Eastman

of the games of football, baseball, basketball, or hockey, as the case may be, engaged in or conducted by such clubs. In 
addition, such laws shall not apply to a joint agreement by which the member clubs of two or more professional football 
leagues, which are exempt from income tax under section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 [26 U.S.C.

1049,1, The Department required certain modifications which AT&T accepted.
1049,2," The Court, of course, considered all the provisions of the plan, including those which were not set down for hearing."
1049,3," The four issues addressed by counsel were the allocation of the costs of equal access, the distribution of contingent liabilities 
arising from antitrust suits against AT&T, assignment of the Bell name and logo, and assignment of patents. Three opponents of 
the plan of reorganization focused on the first two issues: MCI Communications Corp., the Church of Christ et al., and the 
National Association of Regulatory and Utility Commissioners (NARUC); three opponents focused on the last two issues: Tandy 
Corp., Black Citizens for a Fair Media et al., and NARUC.  AT&T and the Department of Justice argued in favor of the plan of 
reorganization on all four issues."
1049,4," Zane Barnes, chief executive-designate of the Southwestern Region, testified about the costs of equal access and the 
assignment of switching systems.  William Weiss, chief executive-designate of the Midwest Region, testified about the 
apportionment of contingent liabilities and the proposed Central Staff Organization.  Thomas Bolger, chief executive-designate of 
the Mid-Atlantic Region, testified about assignment of the Bell name and logo, and assignment of patents."
1049,5," The seven Regional Companies will be holding companies for the twenty-two Bell Operating Companies.  The Northeast 
Region will include New England Telephone Co. and New York Telephone Co.  The Mid-Atlantic Region will include New Jersey 
Bell Telephone Co., the Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania, the Diamond State Telephone Company, and the 
Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Companies of Washington, D.C., Virginia, Maryland, and West Virginia.  The Southern 
Region will include Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Co. and South Central Bell Telephone Company.  The Midwest 
Region will include the Ohio Bell Telephone Co., Michigan Bell Telephone Co., Indiana Bell Telephone Co., Illinois Bell 
Telephone Co., and Wisconsin Telephone Co.  The Mountain-Northwest Region will include Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 
the Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph Co., and Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Co.  The Far West Region will include 
the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Co. and Bell Telephone Company of Nevada.  The Southwest Region will include 
Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.  Although the Regional Companies have been identified by geographic designations 
throughout these proceedings, they will subsequently be adopting formal corporate names.  For instance, the Northeast Region 
has announced that it will call itself NYNEX, while the Mountain-Northwest Region has chosen U.S. West.  Except where the 
distinction appears to be significant, the Regional Companies and the Operating Companies will be referred to herein as the 
Operating Companies."
1049,6," On April 20, 1983, the Court tentatively approved the Local Access and Transport Areas (LATAs) within which the Operating 
Companies' telecommunications services will be confined.  See United States v. Western Electric Co. and American Telephone 
& Telegraph Co., 569 F. Supp. 990 (D.D.C. 1983). The LATA applications were technically the first phase of the plan of 
reorganization. The parties proposed, and the Court accepted, that review of the plan of reorganization be undertaken in two "
1050,," stages for the sake of speed and convenience and because the drawing of geographic boundaries naturally preceded any 
division of assets between AT&T and the Operating Companies.  Remaining issues with respect to the LATAs are considered in 
Part VII infra."
1050,7," Both AT&T and the Department have filed motions for approval of the plan of reorganization. Those motions will be acted upon 
after the required modifications are submitted to the Court."
1050,8," The equal access obligation takes effect on September 1, 1984, and it will be phased in over a two-year period.  By September 
1, 1985, the Operating Companies must provide equal access to one-third of their respective access lines, and by September 1, 
1986, to the remaining access lines.  See Appendix B to the decree."
1050,9," Under Section II(C) of the decree, the Operating Companies are not required to file their precise plans for providing equal 
access until six months after divestiture. That date may be unrealistically late because much of the preparation that must be 
completed by September 1984 cannot be undertaken by the Operating Companies until they are told whether their initial plans 
are acceptable.  See Response of the United States to Public Comments and Action on AT&T's Proposed Plan of 
Reorganization, filed March 24, 1983 (hereinafter Department of Justice Response to Comments) at 187-88."
1050,10," These issues bear, inter alia, on the assignment of assets and liabilities between AT&T and the Operating Companies, and 
they are therefore properly considered as part of the plan of reorganization."
1050,11," In only one of the seven telephone regions will this not occur.  In the Northeast Region, which encompasses New York and 
New England, AT&T and its competitors will be served from the same switches in the same LATAs.  Response of the Northeast 
Region to the Court's May 17, 1983 Memorandum at 2 n. **."
1050,12, It is asserted that even the interexchange carriers will not be able to detect any qualitative difference.
1050,13," Statement of the Operating Companies Supplementing their Responses to the Court's Memorandum of May 17, 1983 
Regarding the No. 4ESS Switching Systems (hereinafter Operating Company Supplement) at 2. "
1051,14," The Operating Companies state that identical per call access would be impossible, even if a uniform access configuration 
were imposed in each LATA, because of ""normal variations of electrical characteristics of facility components and installation 
line-up variations . . . ."" Operating Company Supplement at 3."
1051,15," The Operating Companies are not responsible, of course, for correcting any quality deficiencies that may result from an 
interexchange carrier's own facilities."
1051,16, See Department of Justice Response to Comments at 187.
1051,17," The skepticism of the interexchange competitors relates largely to the kinds of switches the Operating Companies will employ 
to connect the competing interexchange networks with the local Operating Company networks. See 569 F. Supp. 990."
1051,18," An end office is the plant into which individual subscribers' telephone access lines feed.  It is typically the point of 
concentration of telecommunications traffic closest to the subscriber -- i.e., the point of origination or termination -- and it is 
decidedly local in character and function.  In the Bell System hierarchy of functions, this is the facility which performs the Class 5 
function, meaning that from the Class 5 end office a call is either routed directly to another end office through a Class 5 trunk (a 
""local"" call) or it is routed to a Class 4 facility for interconnection with the ""toll"" network. In a number of sites, the Class 4 and 
Class 5 functions are located in the same facility.  Under the plan of reorganization, all such facilities will be owned by the 
Operating Companies because of the local nature of the Class 5 function.  Plan of reorganization at 16-17."
1051,19," There are 91 such switches in the Bell System.  They were first introduced in 1976 and are large, four-wire digital switches 
with the capacity to handle almost 700,000 call attempts per hour.  Memorandum of the Midwest Regional Holding Company, 
May 31, 1983, at 3.  The DMS-200, DMS-100/200, and the No. 5ESS switches are smaller than the No. 4ESS, but they ""provide 
equivalent transmission and switching characteristics as the No. 4ESS."" Response of Donald E. Guinn to the Court's 
Memorandum of May 17, 1983, at 3 n. *.  These four switches are the most advanced of all switches in use today."
1051,*," To the extent that network reconfiguration costs relate to the BOCs' provision of other services (such as intra-LATA toll), rather 
than to carrier access services, the BOCs will be required to include such costs in tariffs for those other services which are filed "
1052,," and allowed to become effective in accordance with this proviso, and any amounts thus recovered shall count toward 
reimbursement of the BOCs' costs of network reconfiguration."
1052,20," Bell System assets will be distributed according to the function they perform.  552 F. Supp. at 206. Those assets performing 
exchange and exchange access functions will be owned by the Operating Companies; those performing interexchange functions 
by AT&T and its affiliates.  Section I(A)(1).  About eighty percent of the Bell System's assets perform one function or the other 
and hence are classifiable with relative ease.  The remaining 20 percent are multifunction assets, providing both exchange and 
interexchange services.  The government proposed, and the Court accepted, that the predominant use test be applied to these 
assets, that is, the asset will be assigned to the entity whose use predominates.  552 F. Supp. at 207. The Court noted, 
however, that in certain cases the test would be inappropriate (552 F. Supp. at 207 n.317) as where a facility primarily used in 
connection with interexchange services was necessary for the provision of equal access by an Operating Company.  See 552 F. 
Supp. at 200-01; section VIII(G) of the decree."
1052,21," These are the advanced switches of the type described in note 19 supra and are the switches most readily connected to the 
four-wire trunks which the interexchange carriers primarily use in their own networks. Pacific and Nevada Bell will use ""state of 
the art digital, four-wire tandems for more than 99 percent of [their] requirements."" Response of Donald E. Guinn at 8 n. *.  This 
appears to be true for New York and New England as well.  In the remaining five regions, it appears that all switches to be 
constructed will be four-wire digital tandems.  Only in a relatively small number of LATAs do the companies propose to provide 
access via two-wire switches. This, and the fact that the Department of Justice will continue to study whether two-wire switches 
can provide suitable access, largely moots the concerns of Satellite Business Systems, Southern Pacific Communications Corp., 
and MCI Communications Corp. that the Operating Companies would make larger scale use of two-wire switches, necessitating 
the use of adapters to connect them to the four-wire trunks of the interexchange competitors."
1052,22," AT&T has consistently maintained that requiring interexchange competitors to hook into two-wire switches via adaptors would 
not impair the quality of the transmissions, a point which AT&T's competitors have just as consistently challenged.  Since the 
Operating Companies have decided to offer mainly four-wire connections, this dispute is largely moot.  See note 21 supra. "
1053,23," E.g., Black Citizens for a Fair Media, et al."
1053,24," NET states that owning the switches, and presumably leasing space to AT&T, would in these instances be the cheapest 
alternative.  The next best option would be for NET to build its own 4ESS switches, with the most costly alternative being to 
lease space from AT&T.  Response of the Northeast Region, May 31, 1983, at 5-6."
1053,25, Different values are achieved depending upon the assumptions used.
1053,26, The expenditure of $20 to $25 million required for the construction of a new switch is not an acceptable alternative.
1053,27," NET should also indicate whether assignment to it of the Cambridge switch would alter its analysis of the impact of a separate 
Worcester LATA.  Specifically, if NET owns the Cambridge switch would it also want to build a Framingham No. 4ESS switch?"
1053,28," The Court notes that Bell of Pennsylvania has supplanted its proposal to use a 1AESS switch to offer access in Harrisburg 
(the ""Capital"" LATA) with a plan to build a DMS-200, 4ESS or comparable four-wire switch by September 1985.  Response of 
the Mid-Atlantic Bell Telephone Companies, May 31, 1983, at 6 n.6.  Bell of Pennsylvania also intends to offer access to the 
Philadelphia LATA through the existing 4ESS until its own digital switch is in place, assuming that ""billing software develops 
satisfactorily."" Id. These plans are hereby approved.  The Court accepts Pacific Northwest Bell's proposal to build its own digital 
switch in Seattle and use direct trunking to provide access pending completion of the switch. See Appendix A to Response of 
Operating Companies in Mountain-Northwest Region to Court's Memorandum of May 17, 1983. The suggestion of the Department of Justice that the date for the Operating Companies' formal equal access filings be advanced 
is a sound one.  The Department should consult with the Operating Companies with regard to the timing of an accelerated 
schedule."
1053,29," It is obvious that this figure is somewhat low, as is indicated, for example, by the claim of the Mid-Atlantic Region that the 
estimate of $73 million does not include any of the $30 million it expects to spend on network reconfiguration.  Response of the 
Mid-Atlantic Bell Telephone Companies, May 31, 1983, at 9 n.10. "
1054,30," AT&T Memorandum, May 23, 1983, at 4 n. **, 5 n. *.  This includes putting in place access tandems for interconnection 
between interexchange carriers' points of presence and the local loops, plus any direct trunks from points of presence to end 
offices where this is considered more efficient than using access tandems.  The exact amount will depend on many factors, 
including any waivers of the equal access requirements pursuant to Appendix B of the decree."
1054,31," The primary responsibility lies with the Operating Companies since as part of the divestiture process they will receive the Bell 
System's local exchange facilities by which equal access will be provided."
1054,32," It has been clear at least since the decision of the Court of Appeals in MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. FCC, 188 U.S. App. 
D.C. 327, 580 F.2d 590 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (Execunet II)) that AT&T was under an obligation to furnish equal or substantially equal 
access to its intercity competitors. See also, United States v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 524 F. Supp. 1336, 1356, 1360 (D.D.C. 1981)."
1054,33," Indeed, the Mid-Atlantic Region expects to spend $200 million for equal access through 1986, but anticipates that, under the 
existing separations procedures, about 60 percent of these costs would be allocated to intrastate, not interstate, rate-making.  As 
the Mid-Atlantic region states: It may be possible, if regulators agree, to apportion these costs more equitably between the interstate and intrastate 
jurisdictions.  If this does not occur, there is no assurance that state regulators will be able to fix intrastate access rates high 
enough to recover these costs.  If rates are fixed at such level, [interexchange carriers] will have a strong incentive to 'forum 
shop' between interstate and intrastate tariffs and to by-pass the BOCs for intrastate access.  Even if the bulk of the costs "
1055,," become properly assigned as between interstate and intrastate access, the possibility of by-pass becomes more 
threatening with each increase in access costs. Response of the Mid-Atlantic Bell Telephone Companies, May 31, 1983, at 9-10. AT&T and the Operating Company personnel apparently are working on a proposal to treat equal access and reconfiguration 
costs as if they were costs of ""Special Services Switching Equipment"" which, it is asserted, ""will avoid the misallocation of costs 
to the intrastate jurisdiction"" and will allocate investment and related expenses on the basis of relative toll minutes, i.e., on the 
basis of carriers actually using access services.  Letter from A. Gray Collins to Howard J. Trienens, filed June 29, 1983, at 2.  
The FCC would have to approve any such proposal."
1055,34," The Court, unlike the Federal Communications Commission, does not consider bypass to be an immediate large-scale 
problem.  See transcript June 2, 1983 hearing at 25466."
1055,35," However, for the reasons stated in note 31 supra, there is no basis for requiring AT&T to pay all of these costs, in addition to 
the contribution it will make by way of the access charges and the costs of the risks assigned to it herein."
1055,36," AT&T is entitled, in equity, to count toward reimbursement of these costs all carrier access charges, not only the charges 
collected from it.  If only AT&T's contributions were counted, the Operating Companies, AT&T's interexchange competitors, or 
both, would reap a windfall."
1055,37," The Operating Companies shall keep records to isolate those expenses incurred solely for equal access and network 
reconfiguration as mandated by the decree from expenses they would have incurred in any event.  AT&T and the Regional 
Companies shall, jointly or severally, submit to the Court prior to January 1, 1984, the accounting method that will be appropriate 
for isolating these expenses and for determining whether and when the costs of equal access and of network configuring have 
been recovered. "
1056,38," This mechanism has several advantages: it avoids any direct financing partnership between AT&T and the Operating 
Companies; it requires relatively little monitoring; it gives effect to the access charge tool; it encourages AT&T to work for 
suitable separations procedures; and it minimizes interference with regulatory commissions."
1056,39," HN2[
] Contingent liabilities are liabilities which are attributable to pre-divestiture events but do not become certain, and are 
therefore not booked, until after divestiture. The plan of reorganization defines ""net investment"" as total assets less reserves for 
depreciation.  AT&T states that it will receive 25 percent of the net investment of the Bell System, and the remaining 75 percent 
will be assigned to the Operating Companies.  AT&T Memorandum, May 23, 1983, at 13 n. *."
1056,40," The plan provides special allocation rules for contingent liabilities relating exclusively to interstate or intrastate operations or to 
tax liabilities.  See Plan of Reorganization at 188-89.  These special rules have either not been specifically challenged by the 
intervenors, or they have been opposed for the same reasons discussed infra for challenging the general rule for allocating 
contingent liabilities.  See, e.g., NASUCA Memorandum, May 25, 1983, at 10."
1056,41," Under the plan, AT&T and the Operating Companies will be responsible for the payment of judgments and determinations of 
liability, regardless whether or not an entity was dismissed from the proceeding by virtue of settlement or otherwise.  Plan of 
Reorganization at 190."
1056,42," No objections were raised with respect to the contingent liabilities having to do with the Bell System's rates, contracts, torts, or 
taxes."
1056,43," CPE is used on subscribers' premises to originate, route, or terminate telecommunications (e.g., telephone sets, answering 
machines).  Section IV(E) of the decree. "

1057,45," See, e.g., Comments of Southern Pacific Communications Co., May 23, 1983, at 15; Comments of MCI Communications 
Corp., May 23, 1983, at 9."
1057,46," Because of the integrated nature of the Bell System, it is unlikely that the result would be any different in the private cases 
brought against that System or its components.  In any event, as developed below, it is appropriate to assign the responsibility 
for the payment of possible judgments now, rather than to leave the issue for resolution for later, on a case-by-case basis.  
Recognizing this reality, few of the intervenors suggest that the matter be left open until judgments are entered; they argue 
instead for a fixing of liability now, albeit on a basis different than that assigned by the plan.  See slip op. at pp. 26-28 infra."
1057,47," AT&T Reply Memorandum, May 31, 1983, at 18 n. *."
1057,48," Such sharing would have occurred through the division of revenues process and a general contribution to the expenses of 
AT&T's General Department, and it is that Department which would have paid any antitrust judgment irrespective of the Bell 
entity upon which it might have been imposed.  Id.; AT&T Response to Objections at 333."
1057,49," See, e.g., Satellite Business Systems Memorandum, May 23, 1983, at 4. "
1058,50," The plan provides that in December 1983, the Operating Companies and AT&T will enter into an agreement which will identify 
all then-pending litigation or other proceedings in which a judgment could result in liability to be allocated under the plan.  This 
agreement will identify whether each contingent liability will be shared by AT&T and the Operating Companies under the net-
investment formula or whether it will be treated under one of the special allocation rules.  Within one month of the institution of 
any other action or proceeding against AT&T or an Operating Company based on pre-divestiture events, notice must be given to 
each entity which may be responsible for payments under the plan.  Plan of Reorganization at 189-90, 470."
1058,51," In that case, the defendant corporation had attempted to file a third-party complaint against other companies seeking 
contribution should it be held liable under the initial complaint.  The Supreme Court upheld the lower court's dismissal of the 
third-party complaint."
1058,52," To the contrary, the Court concluded that it was for the Congress, not the courts, to decide whether there should be a statutory 
right to contribution in antitrust cases and how such contribution should be structured.  451 U.S. at 646."
1058,53," Arguing that the agreement between the Operating Companies and AT&T to share contingent liabilities should be deemed 
void as contrary to public policy, one intervenor cites St. Paul Insurance Companies v. Talledega Nursing Home, Inc., 606 F.2d 
631 (5th Cir. 1979). See Southern Pacific Memorandum of May 23, 1983, at 16.  The St. Paul decision stands only for the 
proposition that under Alabama law insurance contracts protecting against intentional wrongs are invalid.  Not only are such 
contracts not universally considered void, but any public policy problems from such contracts are avoided here because the 
agreement among the Bell companies does not relate to future conduct but applies only to liabilities from pre-divestiture events. Zenith (note 44 supra) is likewise inapplicable because the jurisdictional problems there involved are not present here and 
because of the contractual agreements discussed infra."
1058,54," On this basis, since AT&T will receive 25 percent of the net investment of the Bell System, it will be responsible for 25 percent 
of the contingent liabilities.  See note 39 supra."
1058,55," These intervenors assert (1) that AT&T's future lines of business, not those of the Operating Companies, benefitted from 
whatever anticompetitive conduct occurred, (2) that the potential liability from alleged anticompetitive conduct bears no 
necessary relationship to the assets being divided, and (3) that the method prescribed by the plan, coincidentally or otherwise, 
favors AT&T's interest as against that of the Operating Companies. "
1059,56," See United Church of Christ Reply, May 31, 1983, at 8 (not possible to determine the extent to which Operating Companies 
and their ratepayers benefitted from AT&T's policies); General Dynamics Telephone System Center, Inc. Response, May 20, 
1983, at 8 (alleged antitrust violations did not necessarily inure to the benefit of the Operating Companies ""to the same degree"" 
as they did to AT&T)."
1059,57," Because of this problem, California suggests that the test for allocating contingent liabilities should be: which line of business 
""primarily"" stood to benefit from the antitrust violation? State of California Memorandum, May 25, 1983, at 19.  New Mexico 
advocates that where ultimately there remains a dispute about which entity receives the post-divestiture benefit, the matter 
should be submitted to arbitration.  State of New Mexico Reply Comments, April 13, 1983, at 5."
1059,58," The break-up of the Bell System does not, in a number of respects, involve a neat division of operations and lines of business.  
For example, the Operating Companies will handle some intercity toll calls -- especially in some of the larger LATAs -- and they 
will also be able to market CPE."
1059,59," The decree provides that AT&T is to divest the Operating Companies with 45 percent debt ratios (55 percent equity).  This 
ratio represents the 1981 (year end) consolidated debt ratio of the Bell System and was also the System's target debt ratio for 
the end of 1983.  See AT&T Reply Comments, June 29, 1982, at 95-96."
1059,60," The equity portion of the Bell System's capital structure represents, in effect, the shareholders' reserve against business risks, 
including contingent liabilities.  The possibility that certain contingent liabilities may not become certain or may not be turned into 
debt does not mean that these contingent liabilities are not business risks which currently encumber equity. One intervenor (Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission Memorandum, May 25, 1983, at 5) argues that, if the 
Operating Companies were not assigned any contingent liabilities, they could be considered as receiving too much equity only if 
all other business risks in the overall Bell System capital structure were equal, and it goes on to state that there is good reason 
to believe that the Operating Companies will face higher risks because they are removed from certain lines of business by the 
decree. This argument is too speculative.  Even though AT&T will retain some of what have been the more lucrative lines of 
business in the past, these are the competitive lines of business, and there are some who regard them as riskier than the "
1060,," Operating Companies' monopoly exchange functions.  See Fortune, Breaking Up The Phone Company, June 27, 1983, at 81-
91."
1060,61," AT&T could have decided to handle the contingent liabilities problem by one of the following methods, all of which would have 
led to results similar to the apportionment provided for by the plan of reorganization: (1) The Bell System could have chosen to pay these liabilities through settlement of the litigation before the decree was 
entered (or before divestiture occurred), such payment to be funded by debt.  The Operating Companies would then be 
divested with higher debt ratios (perhaps 50 percent) to reflect the higher debt ratio of the Bell System.  There would then, 
of course, be no residual risks to divide. (2) The Bell System could have purchased insurance, with the premiums funded by debt.  Again, this would have pushed 
the System's debt ratio closer to 50 percent, and the allocation of contingent liabilities would then have become irrelevant 
since any judgment would have been paid by the insurer. (3) The Bell System could have self-insured the contingent liabilities with a funded reserve of some $25 billion, which would 
have been borrowed and held in a separate account.  The System's debt ratio would again have risen closer to 50 percent, 
and whichever entity would have been assigned the contingent liabilities would have received this separate reserve 
account. (4) The Bell System could have self-insured by booking the contingent liabilities through transfer of a portion of its equity to 
an appropriate liability account.  The choice then would have been either for AT&T to take all the contingent liabilities and 
the liability account, or AT&T and the Operating Companies each could have taken a share of both the contingent liabilities 
and the corresponding liability account. In essence, AT&T and the Operating Companies decided to select the last option -- each will receive a share of the contingent 
liabilities and each will receive more equity than it would have had if one of the other three options had been selected.  The only 
substantive difference between that option and the proposed plan is that the shareholders' equity reserve is not being 
segregated into a separate liability account.  By accepting a share of the contingent liabilities and a higher equity ratio, the 
Operating Companies are all simply participating in underwriting the System's contingent liabilities.  In this way, they are insuring 
each other, and they will retain any profit which otherwise would have gone to an insurer."
1060,62," AT&T Memorandum, May 23, 1983, at 11-12."
1060,63," See testimony of Thomas Bolger, June 2, 1983, transcript at 25603-04; testimony of William Weiss, June 2, 1983, transcript at 
25493-94; but see testimony of Zane Barnes, June 2, 1983, transcript at 25487. The Court notes that it is entirely unlikely that the contingent liabilities could realistically threaten the viability of the Operating 
Companies.  AT&T has suggested that $25 billion in additional liabilities might become certain after divestiture, but it has since 
hastened to concede that this possibility is extremely remote.  Even if this outside contingency came to pass, the Operating 
Companies could finance their shares with debt, and their debt ratios would then increase from 45 percent to the 50 percent 
range -- still the typical debt ratio of independent telephone companies and electrical utilities."
1060,64," The Court has also considered the various provisions made in the plan of reorganization with respect to other liabilities, 
reserves, and equity, including tax reserves, depreciation reserves, and long term debt, and finds the treatment of these matters 
in the plan to be reasonable. "
1061,," It is appropriate briefly to mention the debt of Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Co., which has been the subject of several 
submissions both by the Operating Company and by the State of California.  Upon consideration of all the documents, the Court 
has concluded that it will not require a modification of the plan of reorganization with regard to this issue because the plan is not 
the appropriate vehicle for determining the extent to which the local company's debt problems may have been created by the 
California regulators -- as was previously assumed by this Court (552 F. Supp. at 208) as well as by the FCC staff (Staff Analysis 
of February 11, 1983, at 27-28) and various financial rating services -- or by AT&T. The debt equalization scheme which is proposed by California would inappropriately result in inter-regional subsidies and create 
complex problems leading to new and continuing AT&T entanglements with the Operating Companies.  In any event, neither the 
decree nor the plan of reorganization adversely affects Pacific's financial condition; if anything, they improve it.  See Second 
Supplemental Statement of Donald Guinn, April 7, 1983, at 1.  Pacific's interest coverage ratio will be above the level necessary 
to maintain a Standard & Poor's ""A-"" rating.  Supplemental Statement of Donald Guinn, January 13, 1983, at 2; AT&T Response 
to Objections at 300-01.  While future developments and perceptions cannot be vouchsafed, it appears that Pacific will be 
divested in as financially a sound condition as its prior history permits."
1061,65," AT&T and the Operating Companies could not use ""common corporate names,"" however."
1061,66," The Central Staff Organization to be established by the Operating Companies (see Part VIII infra) was to receive the rights to 
the existing Bell trademarks for use in connection with lawful Operating Company business except for the marketing of 
""equipment not supplied by AT&T and its affiliates."" The trademarks include not only the encircled bell logo but also the blue and 
ochre stripes, and other trademarks and service marks used on vehicles, telephone directories, and the like.  They will generally 
be collectively referred to as the Bell ""logo."""
1061,67," If only because of the explicit representations made by AT&T's counsel to the Court during the first Tunney Act hearing in June 
1982 (see pp. 48-49 infra), this alternative cannot be seriously entertained."
1061,68," It stipulated, however, that compensation had to be paid to the Operating Companies for the direct costs of revamping their 
trademarks and trade names."
1061,69, AT&T would retain its present rights to trade names and trademarks for use outside the United States.
1061,70," AT&T could continue to use the name ""Bell Laboratories"" without modification. AT&T could also continue to use the descriptive 
phrase ""Bell System,"" albeit with the modifier ""American."" The amendment further provides that AT&T would conduct an 
extensive advertising campaign to distinguish its products, names, and trademarks from those of the Operating Companies. "
1062,71, Reply of Tandy Corporation at 8.
1062,72," This confusion would exist regardless whether the Operating Companies would market CPE under the Bell label.  Even if 
there were no such marketing, customers would still be led to believe that the providers of local exchange, exchange access, 
and directory advertising services are intimately connected with American Bell, and that AT&T's equipment -- the only equipment 
that would be marked ""Bell"" -- would be the most adaptable to the local system."
1062,73," It is on a similar rationale that the Court required modification of the decree to dispel customer confusion arising from joint 
billing.  552 F. Supp. at 199."
1062,74," One of the intervenors provided the apt example of a newspaper advertisement proclaiming ""NOW YOU CAN BUY GENUINE 
AMERICAN BELL EQUIPMENT THROUGH THE RETAIL OUTLETS OPERATED BY YOUR LOCAL BELL TELEPHONE "
1063,," COMPANY."" Reply of Tandy Corporation at 5.  There can be no doubt that consumers would be led to conclude by such an 
advertisement that these various ""Bell"" entities are all part of one giant company, and that their equipment was so designed that 
it would all mesh better than would some other, ""foreign"" equipment.  This would be so if the Bell System had not become fixed 
in the national consciousness for a hundred years as a single corporation; it is even more true because of that historical fact."
1063,75," [***127]  AT&T argues, citing several trademark decisions (e.g., Gould Engineering Co. v. Goebel, 320 Mass. 200, 68 N.E.2d 
702 (1946); Gemeinde Brau, Inc. v. Amana Society, 557 F.2d 638 (8th Cir. 1977)) that different businesses which ""share a 
common heritage"" may use the same mark in separable parts of the business.  See Response to Comments at 480-90.  That 
argument lacks merit.  Trademark law as it has developed in the context of claims of unfair competition between competing 
concerns is of dubious applicability to a situation -- divestiture under antitrust principles -- where the interests of outside 
competitors and the public are implicated.  Cf.  Ford Motor Co. v. United States, 405 U.S. 562, 576 & n.11, 31 L. Ed. 2d 492, 92 
S. Ct. 1142 (1971). In any event, the lines of businesses of AT&T and the Operating Companies are not separable but related 
and, in the equipment market, they will be direct competitors. The customer confusion this would foster would delay achievement 
of a truly competitive CPE industry. It was for similar reasons HN4[
] that the various oil companies which emerged from the 1911 break-up of Standard Oil have 
generally been prohibited from doing business under a Standard Oil name or trademark in a territory where Standard Oil 
denoted another product.  See, e.g., Standard Oil Co. (Kentucky) v. Humble Oil & Refining Co., 363 F.2d 945, 951 (5th Cir. 
1966) (""we think long cumbersome records are no longer necessary to prove the public believes that all of the pseudonyms for 
Standard Oil belong to the same or related companies"")."
1063,76," The various components of the Bell System will, to be sure, be separated from each other in a legal, ownership, and financial 
sense.  But if they were all to support each other in their marketing and promotional efforts, not a great deal will have been 
gained.  Together they would still crowd out all others; together they would still be the colossus of telecommunications."
1063,77," Use by AT&T of the terms ""Bell System"" or ""American Bell System"" is particularly troublesome, for it implies that the system 
that will be broken up on January 1, 1984 actually survives in the form of AT&T."
1063,78," It is worth noting also that this confusion is actually being encouraged by AT&T's current advertising which features such 
phrases as ""Bell System"" and ""Genuine Bell."" Indeed, AT&T announced its decision to name its equipment marketing subsidiary 
""American Bell, Inc."" after it had learned of the Department of Justice's objection to the use by AT&T of the word ""Bell"" in any 
way which could imply a continuing ""endorsement or relationship between the BOCs' monopoly local exchange service and the 
products and services of AT&T and its affiliates"" (letter of September 23, 1982, from William F. Baxter to Howard J. Trienens 
(Exhibit D to Objections of Tandy Corp., filed February 18, 1983)) and after at least one intervenor in the public interest 
proceeding before this Court (Tandy Corp.) had similarly complained about such use.  AT&T advertising focusing on the word 
""Bell"" has proceeded at a crescendo since the divestiture decision was made. Because of this history, not much faith can be placed in AT&T's promise to undertake an advertising campaign to educate 
consumers as to the differences between the new entities. An effective campaign along these lines would be directly contrary to 
AT&T's interests. "
1064,79, Plan of Reorganization at 415.
1064,80, See 552 F. Supp. at 201-04.
1064,81," See Ford Motor Co. v. United States, supra, 405 U.S. at 576 and n.11. AT&T also ""owns"" a sizable magnitude of liabilities, 
including the contingent liabilities the responsibility for which will pass in large part to the Operating Companies (see Part II 
supra), yet it has never taken the position with respect to these liabilities that they constitute its obligation as distinguished from 
that of the Operating Companies."
1064,82," The reference to a ""common heritage"" is puzzling for another reason as well.  It is because that common heritage was 
allegedly used to violate the antitrust laws, and it is presumably because the ""common heritage"" was so intrinsically 
anticompetitive, defying less drastic remedies such as injunctions, that this lawsuit was filed and this divestiture agreement was 
made and approved."
1064,83, Response to Objections at 486-87.
1064,84," AT&T also claims that the trademark and the tradename Bell belongs to the party which manufactured Bell equipment, i.e., 
Western Electric Co.  However, as one commentator put it, When one says that a trademark must indicate origin of the goods to which it is applied, it is not intended to [imply] that a 
trademark can only be used by a manufacturer of the goods . . . .  The origin to which reference is made is the party that 
introduces the goods on which the mark is used into commerce with the trademark on them and who primarily stands to "
1065,," gain or lose by the acceptable qualities of the goods.  It is not even necessary that the public or purchasers know who is the 
manufacturer of the goods . . . . E. Vandenburgh, Trademark Law and Procedure at 35 (2d ed). Moreover, it is undisputed that AT&T has not supplied to the Operating Companies and hence held out to the public only 
products made by it or its affiliates.  See Amended Certification of Thomas E. Bolger, April 6, 1983, at 4. While certainly a survey of the public would indicate that the name ""Bell"" and the Bell logo do not connote the same thing to 
every single person -- an individual who has written checks monthly to one of the Operating Companies which does not use the 
name ""Bell"" in its corporate name may be more likely to think of ""Ma Bell"" than of a local Operating Company, for instance -- it 
cannot be gainsaid that the primary connection between the individual and the Bell System occurred between telephone 
subscriber and local Operating Company.  Assignment of Bell name and logo to the Operating Companies is thus consistent 
with the trademark law."
1065,85," See, e.g., Statement of Wallace R. Bunn, May 23, 1983; Reply Memorandum of the Midwest Regional Holding Co., May 31, 
1983; Supplemental Statement of Zane E. Barnes, April 12, 1983.  Here, again, AT&T cannot have it both ways: it cannot 
relegate the largest share of the Bell System obligations to the Operating Companies yet purport to speak conclusively on behalf 
of the entire System with regard to the plan of reorganization even where there is a sharp dispute among the various 
components.  See note 81 supra."
1065,86, See note 43 supra.
1065,87," The Court repeated this reasoning in its Memorandum of August 23, 1982, denying the Justice Department's motion for 
reconsideration (at p. 5): "
1066,," Balanced against the remote contingency that the Operating Companies would engage in anticompetitive conduct is the 
certainty that they would provide healthy competition for AT&T . . . .  Allowing the Operating Companies to engage in 
providing CPE will serve as a useful competitive check on AT&T, not only deterring the possibility of anticompetitive 
behavior but also benefitting consumers by increasing the number of equipment providers in the market place."
1066,88," August 23, 1982, Memorandum Opinion at 4 n.7.  Since the provision allowing the marketing of CPE was added to the decree 
at the Court's insistence, it would not be unreasonable to regard the Court's expectations in that regard as the most accurate 
expression of the decree's ""intent."""
1066,89," A substantial amount of testimony at the June 2, 1983, hearing was devoted to this issue."
1066,90," Letter dated April 13, 1983, from Raymond F. Burke, Vice President and General Counsel-designate of the Northeast region; 
see also, e.g., Supplement to Sworn Statement of Wallace R. Bunn, chief executive officer-designate of Southeast region; 
Statement of Thomas Bolger at 2-3."
1066,91," There is some merit to AT&T's point that its employees have an emotional attachment to the Bell name, and that to them the 
name's passing may mean the loss of an emblem of pride and perhaps life-long association.  The same could be said about 
employees of the Operating Companies, however. "
1067,92," It is significant also, in antitrust terms, that transfer of the Bell name and logo to the Operating Companies will not eliminate 
AT&T as a competitor but will yield two competitors where otherwise there might only be one.  Cf.  United States v. Lever 
Brothers Co., 216 F. Supp. 887 (S.D.N.Y. 1963)."
1067,93," AT&T suggests that it is not, even now, proposing ""common corporate names."" When the promise was made that there would 
be no ""common corporate names,"" it would have been difficult to visualize that AT&T promised only that a modifier would be 
added to the word ""Bell"" but that otherwise that name would still be used by all of the successor entities of the Bell System.  Had 
not AT&T's counsel hastened to assure the Court that no amendment of the proposed decree was necessary, the Court would 
have, then and there, insisted upon language which is not susceptible of the current ""fine print"" argument."
1067,94," The assignment of the Bell name and logo to the Operating Companies rather than to AT&T is further consistent with those 
provisions of the decree which distribute assets on the basis of predominant use.  As the Department of Justice points out, [assignment] of the Bell logo and marks to AT&T would create relatively more transitional costs, due to the relatively greater 
number of BOC assets upon which the marks and logo appear, in comparison to those retained by AT&T, e.g., on 
buildings, trucks, phone booths. Department of Justice Response to Comments at 155."
1067,95," The Court will consider postponing the effective date of the prohibition for an additional six months upon a showing by AT&T 
made by November 1, 1983, that it needs more time to continue a promotional campaign with respect to whatever name it 
desires to adopt in place of ""American Bell."" Although to some extent AT&T has created this problem by its recent intensive 
advertising campaign (see note 78 supra), it is nevertheless appropriate to allow it a reasonable period within which to extricate 
itself from this situation. "
1068,96," AT&T may, however, continue to use the ""Bell"" name with respect to its Bell Laboratories and its foreign operations.  The 
Laboratories and the foreign operations will not be in competition with the Operating Companies, and use of the ""Bell"" name in 
these contexts will not otherwise be confusing."
1068,97, See Part VIII infra.
1068,98," Such restrictions have in other contexts been found to violate the antitrust laws.  See, e.g., Ohio-Sealy Mattress Manufacturing 
Co. v. Sealy, Inc., 585 F.2d 821 (7th Cir. 1978)."
1068,99," Whether the use of the word ""Bell"" with an appropriate prefix could pass muster under the law of trademarks and unfair 
competition outside a particular Regional Company's territory may be expected to depend upon the particular facts of each use 
(e.g., the precise configuration of the name and logo, the results of customer surveys, and the like).  Any decision now on that 
issue would therefore not only be entirely speculative and premature but it might also be beyond the Court's jurisdiction, and it 
will accordingly be left to another day and another forum. "
1069,100," ""Patents"" as used in this Opinion includes non-patented technical information.  The parties have agreed that the Operating 
Companies would be granted rights not only to patents but also to all technical information funded by the license contracts.  552 
F. Supp. at 177. The plan as proposed applies only to United States patents; the Operating Companies would receive no rights 
to foreign patents. Objections to this aspect of the plan are discussed at note 116 infra."
1069,101," AT&T's original proposal, which was modified at the request of the Department of Justice, would not have permitted the 
Operating Companies to engage in sublicensing on their own at all but would have required them to request AT&T to perform all 
sublicensing for them.  The parties have since agreed to a modification of this part of the plan, and each Operating Company will 
now have the right directly to sublicense patents to any firm for use in supplying goods or services to that company, regardless 
whether the sublicensee is then a party to a license agreement with AT&T.  See Department of Justice Response to Comments 
at 141. "
1070,102," The Court further relied on the fact that ""the parties have assured the Court that the Operating Companies will have the right 
to sublicense the AT&T patents and technical information to those providing them with goods and services."" 552 F. Supp. at 177."
1070,103," 552 F. Supp. at 177. Neither AT&T nor the Department of Justice thereafter contradicted the Court's understanding, whether 
by a motion for reconsideration or otherwise."
1070,104," Indeed, the Court is disturbed that representations made by both parties in so clear and unequivocal a fashion are now 
claimed, after the decree has been entered, to be encumbered by gaping loopholes."
1070,105," See AT&T May 31, 1983 Memorandum at 24; Department of Justice Memorandum, June 10, 1983, at 3. The Department of Justice points out that AT&T made the following statement during the Tunney Act proceedings: The Decree requires that AT&T afford the BOCs sufficient technical information to independently provide exchange 
telecommunications service and exchange access functions (Decree, § I(A)(I)).  In compliance with that provision, AT&T 
will continue to license to the BOCs on a royalty-free basis existing patents and patents issuing within five years after entry 
of the Decree. AT&T Reply Comments, May 21, 1982, at 123. The Department further referred to its May 20, 1982 Response to Public Comments at 38, where it stated: In addition, AT&T has made a commitment to the Department that it will continue to license to the BOCs, on a royalty-free 
basis, all existing patents and patents issued within five years of the date of entry of the modification. Such licenses will be "
1071,," for the life of the patent and will include the right to grant sublicensee to others to provide the BOCs with goods and 
services for the BOCs' own use (emphasis added). Department of Justice June 10, 1983 Memorandum at 3. The Department argues that the ""own use"" limitation is not consistent with an interpretation that these companies would be 
granted the right to sublicense patents to manufacturers who provided them with products for resale.  But the decree grants to 
the Operating Companies the right to provide CPE, and these companies obviously need to be supplied with products to use in 
selling CPE to the general public.  See infra."
1071,106," Department of Justice Response to Public Comments, May 20, 1982, at 132."
1071,107, Id. at 132-33. 
1072,108," The Department of Justice and AT&T also point out that section VIII(B) -- which authorizes the Operating Companies to 
provide printed directory advertising services (i.e., Yellow Pages) -- specifically provides that the technical information necessary 
to provide such services should be transferred to the Operating Companies.  From this premise they argue that since section 
VIII(A) -- which authorizes the Operating Companies to provide CPE -- is silent with regard to the transfer of technical 
information, the conclusion may be drawn that no transfer of CPE patents to the Operating Companies was intended. This argument is likewise unpersuasive, since there is another, more plausible explanation for the variation between sections 
VIII(A) and VIII(B).  The language in section VIII(B) concerning technical information is part of a larger provision, similar to 
section I(A)(1), which was intended to result in the transfer to the Operating Companies of all Bell System assets used in the 
production of printed directories.  See 552 F. Supp. at 194 n.263. If this provision had been used in the CPE context, it would 
have effectively assigned to the Operating Companies the embedded CPE and the existing network of retail outlets, contrary to 
the Court's intent.  See 552 F. Supp. at 192 n.248."
1072,109, AT&T Response to Objections at 462.
1072,110," That is, ""central"" AT&T, as distinguished from the Bell System as a whole."
1072,111," This is so even if it is assumed, as AT&T asserts, that no expenses have been billed to the Operating Companies for new 
CPE patents since May 1980.  See testimony of Thomas Bolger, designated chief executive of Mid-Atlantic Region, June 2, 
1983, transcript at 25594, 25597-98."
1072,112," With regard to all patents, AT&T will retain ownership and the right to use them in any lawful way it sees fit.  None of the 
licensing requirements in the decree or in the plan of reorganization as required to be modified by the Court changes that fact in 
any way."
1072,113," [***135]  E.g., patents applicable directly to inter-LATA services or to foreign operations."
1072,114," E.g., in the so-called ""corridors"" and the Official Services (see slip op. at pp. 115 and 91 infra). "
1073,115," See, e.g., testimony of Thomas Bolger, June 2, 1983, transcript at 25595."
1073,116," With regard to foreign patents, AT&T argues that since the Operating Companies' exchange operations are confined to this 
country, the rights to AT&T's domestic patents provide all the patent rights the Operating Companies require to conduct 
exchange and directory advertising operations.  AT&T Memorandum, May 31, 1983, at 24 n. **. However, in the CPE area, at 
least, foreign patents could be helpful to the Operating Companies even though they will not be operating overseas, for rights to 
foreign patents will enable them to purchase CPE which is manufactured entirely or in part by foreign companies.  See testimony 
of Thomas Bolger, June 2, 1983, transcript at 25600; Memorandum of Mid-West Regional Holding Company, May 23, 1983, at 
19; Memorandum of Mid-West Regional Holding Company, May 31, 1983, at 8."
1073,117," The Operating Companies would benefit from these rights if any of the line of business restrictions should be lifted at any time 
during the life of the particular patent, not simply during the five years after divestiture. A lifting of the restrictions, or some of 
them, during that extended period is certainly conceivable."
1073,118," It may be noted that requests to modify the proposed plan of reorganization so as to broaden the scope of patent rights 
granted to the Operating Companies were made by the Midwest Regional Holding Company (see Reply Memorandum of May 
31, 1983); Thomas Bolger, designated chief executive of the Mid-Atlantic Region (see Second Amended Certificate of June 10, 
1983); and Wallace R. Bunn, designated chief executive of the Southeast Region (see Statement of May 23, 1983)."
1073,119," See 552 F. Supp. at 177 (Operating Companies may grant sublicenses ""to those providing them with goods and services"").  
Likewise, the Plan of Reorganization at 411-12, as modified by Amendment 34, provides that AT&T will grant to each BOC the right -- which no BOC currently has -- to sublicense such AT&T patents to competing 
manufacturers for use only in providing the BOCs with goods or services embodying the inventions of the patents, provided 
that such sublicense does not prejudice AT&T's existing cross license agreements."
1073,120," Several intervenors have suggested that the plan be modified to allow the Operating Companies to sublicense patents to 
manufacturers for the provision of goods and services not only to the Operating Companies but also to other purchasers, 
arguing that such broader sublicensing rights would result in increased royalty payments to the Operating Companies and, due 
to greater economies of scale, to the reduction in cost of all goods produced by independent manufacturers. See, e.g., Reply of "
1074,," Wang Laboratories, April 13, 1983.  The Court will not order such a modification, however, since it would, in effect, permit the 
Operating Companies to enter the patent licensing business."
1074,121," AT&T contends that the Operating Companies need not be granted rights to CPE patents in view of the Court's observation 
that the Operating Companies will enter the CPE market ""from a zero base."" AT&T Response to Objections at 465 n.* (citing 552 
F. Supp. at 192 & n. 248). There is nothing in the Court's language to support AT&T's conclusion; it merely justified the 
assignment to AT&T of the embedded CPE and the retail outlets."
1074,122," Second Amended Certificate of Thomas Bolger, June 10, 1983, at 6.  When questioned by the Court at the June 2, 1983 
hearing as to whether the Operating Companies would use the CPE patents other than merely as a source of revenue, Bolger 
responded: I would use them in order to allow me the freedom to make arrangements with suppliers, if I wanted to and if I found that it 
would be valuable for me to do so, so that I would have additional flexibility to procure CPE for my requirements. . . .  I'm 
not going to sell the technology.  I want to use it to help me enter the CPE market. Transcript at 25596."
1074,123," The logic underlying the licensing of all patents to the Operating Companies was to assure their independence from AT&T by 
providing alternative sources of supply for goods and services which they would use in the businesses which they were 
authorized to conduct.  These companies had long been a captive market for Western Electric, both for telecommunications 
equipment and for CPE.  Operating Company independence from AT&T is therefore crucial to CPE marketing, just as it is with 
respect to exchange and exchange access functions.  With regard to both businesses the Operating Companies will be free to 
purchase equipment (or services) from suppliers which do not require licenses under AT&T patents; with regard to both 
businesses it is important, however, that they be able to purchase from alternative sources equipment (or services) which would 
not be available without sublicenses under AT&T patents."
1074,124," As indicated, the Operating Companies will be permitted to sublicense CPE patents only in order to enable a manufacturer to 
provide goods for resale by the Operating Companies.  See infra. Thus, any royalty received by the Operating Companies under 
such sublicenses will, in all probability, be in the form of a reduced wholesale price paid by the Operating Companies to the 
manufacturer. "
1075,125," See Statement of Wallace Bunn of May 23, 1983 at 5-7; Testimony of Thomas Bolger, June 2, 1983, transcript at 25596."
1075,126," There is no reason why an Operating Company would sublicense a particular CPE patent to only one manufacturer. See 
testimony of Thomas Bolger, June 2, 1983, transcript at 25597."
1075,127," To be sure, another consequence would be that AT&T would acquire additional competitors in the CPE business, but this 
could hardly be regarded as an ""adverse"" effect in the context of this antitrust decree designed, in part at least, to open the CPE 
market to competition."
1075,128, Department of Justice Response to Comments at 143-44.
1075,129," At the same time, as the Court made clear, there are abundant reasons why the marketing of CPE by the Operating 
Companies is in the public interest (552 F. Supp. at 191-92)."
1075,130," See 552 F. Supp. at 192; Memorandum of August 23, 1982."
1075,131," The Department has not attempted to explain how the grant to the Operating Companies of the right to sublicense CPE 
patents would increase the potential for cross-subsidization.  The Department has, however, given three reasons why in its view 
discrimination among manufacturers could occur: (1) the sublicensing of patents would increase the Operating Companies' 
incentive to discriminate against certain vendors because the companies would have an incentive to market only the products of 
manufacturers operating under the sublicenses; (2) the Operating Companies would have the ability to extract concessions from 
manufacturers, thus undermining the potential for variety and merit purchasing; and (3) a financial interest in the success of a 
particular technology would enhance the incentives of the Operating Companies to develop standards through the CSO, which 
they own and control, to favor such technology.  Department of Justice Memorandum, May 31, 1983, at 12-13. The principal difficulty with these arguments is that there will be no reason for the Operating Companies to sublicense to only 
one particular manufacturer (and thus to favor that manufacturer's products) and a number of reasons why sublicenses will be 
granted to a number of manufacturers. See notes 126 supra and 134 infra. Additionally, the type of ""concessions"" the Operating 
Companies would extract from their sublicensing rights would be lower wholesale prices, which is hardly anticompetitive or "
1076,," contrary to the selection of vendors based on merit.  Finally, if the Operating Companies were able to sublicense Bell System 
technology, more manufacturers would have access to this technology than if it were tightly controlled by AT&T, and it would be 
less likely rather than more so that the CSO would set standards that favored only AT&T and Western Electric products.  See 
Independent Data Communications Manufacturers Assoc., Inc. Reply Memorandum, May 31, 1983, at 9 n. 19."
1076,132," Irrespective whether a sublicense is involved, the Operating Companies will share no common facilities with manufacturers. 
Further, sublicensing of CPE patents by the Operating Companies is no more a step into manufacturing than is the sublicensing 
of exchange and exchange access patents designed to provide goods and services to the Operating Companies for their 
exchange operations -- yet the Department of Justice does not object to the latter.  If Operating Company sublicensing of CPE 
patents were considered a form of manufacturing violative of the decree, then so presumably would the sublicensing of any 
patent by an Operating Company to a manufacturer -- and the promises of AT&T and the Department of Justice made during the 
Tunney Act proceeding would be reduced to a nullity."
1076,133," See Memorandum of Midwest Regional Holding Co., May 23, 1983, at 20 n. 20.  It is difficult to see how sublicensing of 
patents would be a ""step into manufacturing"" likely to produce anticompetitive conduct also because the Operating Companies 
will, by necessity, have to negotiate with independent equipment manufacturers over a variety of contractual terms (e.g., 
specification and design terms, volume contracts, trademark licenses) in order to obtain a distinctive line of products for resale."
1076,134," The Operating Companies will have no economic incentive to engage in discriminatory conduct merely because they will 
have the ability to sublicense. As they enter the CPE market with a zero market share, their overriding incentive will be to enter 
into arrangements with as many vendors as is necessary to produce the highest quality, lowest priced products for resale to the 
general public.  And the Operating Company executives have given every indication to the Court that this is precisely what they 
intend to do."

1076,138," This may be done under that section, if it is demonstrated that ""there is no substantial possibility that [an Operating Company] 
could use its monopoly power to impede competition in the market it seeks to enter."" "
1077,139," Until the occurrence of such an event, if ever, the particular patent licenses in the possession of the Operating Companies will 
simply lie dormant.  AT&T will not be injured by the grant to the Operating Companies of licenses to patents which, ultimately, 
these companies may never utilize.  There is also no need, therefore, to fear that the Operating Companies will use their patent 
rights to ""peddle"" AT&T technology.  AT&T Memorandum May 23, 1982, at 23."
1077,140," Whether or not AT&T sought the Bell name and patent restrictions or was required or persuaded by the Department of Justice 
to agree to them, there can be no doubt that they are advantageous to AT&T, for they would, as a practical matter, eliminate 
competition from the Operating Companies or significantly curtail the effectiveness of such competition."

subscribers."
1077,143," See In the Matter of MTS and WATS Market Structure, CC Docket No. 78-72 Phase I (adopted December 22, 1982).  The 
FCC also decided to begin this program on January 1, 1984, the date of the reorganization of the Bell System.  This effective 
date makes it appear that the imposition of this burden on consumers is related to the decree herein -- which clearly it is not (see

elderly to reach physicians, close relatives, or others who might give them aid; and the desire of those in isolated areas of the 
country for contact with others."
1078,147," That decision, at bottom, rests upon the proposition that novel bypass technologies may erode the financial health of the 
Operating Companies, and that increased support from the residential ratepayers will allow these companies to remain 
competitive.  There is no reason to believe that bypass on a large scale is imminent.  Further, evolving technology may be 
expected to result overall in reduced costs.  Rather than to serve as a basis for imposing a new burden on local ratepayers, such 
technology and such reduced costs would better be channelled to benefit all segments of the public, including the local 
subscribers."

1079,152," For example, the union posits that gains in one Operating Company's assets would no longer be available to compensate for 
losses in another Company's assets."
1079,153," A fourth criticism -- that the distribution of the Trust's assets may be out of synchronization with the distribution of its liabilities, 
i.e., the accrued benefits of employees -- is plainly without merit.  Elaborate actuarial studies will be performed after employee 
assignments have been finalized to ensure that pension assets in the appropriate amounts follow each employee.  A company 
would therefore not receive a disproportionate number of employees near retirement without also receiving a proportionately 
greater amount of pension assets."
1079,154," Plan of Reorganization at 281 n. 317.  Moreover, AT&T and the Union have already bargained over certain effects of 
divestiture on employees' pension and health benefits, and the results of this bargaining are reflected in the Amended New 
Entities Arguments dated March 26, 1982, March 30, 1982, and April 5, 1982.  See AT&T Response to Objections at 397. "
1080,155," In Katz, the Supreme Court held unlawful an employer's unilateral establishment of new systems of wage increases, sick 
leave provisions, and merit raises at a time when it was negotiating with the union regarding the same subjects.  Bastian-
Blessing likewise involved the unilateral termination by the employer of a health insurance plan which had been the subject of 
collective bargaining.  Neither case even remotely resembles the facts of the instant situation."
1080,156," AT&T proposes to continue to administer the pension plan of any Regional Company that requests such ""full service"" 
assistance for a transition period during which the Company would acquire the skills and resources to manage its own pension 
plan.  Regional Companies that request this option would receive their share of pension assets no later than 1987.  Plan of 
Reorganization at 297.  The Court approves of AT&T's continued management of a Regional Company's pension plan with the 
expectations that the Regional Companies choosing this option will have as much authority over their respective plans while they 
are technically under AT&T's administration as they desire, and that the transition periods will be kept to a minimum.  It would be 
impractical to insist that assets be immediately transferred to a company that does not believe it can prudently manage them.  At 
the same time, continued linkage between AT&T and the Regional Companies is not to be encouraged.  In this regard, AT&T 
proposes to continue managing the Bell System Trust's real estate investments, which amount to approximately $3.1 billion.  
The Court approves this aspect of the plan, although reluctantly, in view of the nonliquid nature of these assets and the 
allowance for a Regional Company or AT&T to buy out of the arrangement."
1080,157," AT&T and the Department of Justice represent that this will be the case: benefit amounts and entitlement and eligibility 
requirements will not change.  The financial performance of the individual plans may vary but the Union has offered nothing but 
speculation that any such variation would have an actual effect on the level of benefits, particularly since the fair market value of 
the BSPP and BSMPP trusts exceeds the present value of accrued benefits.  Plan of Reorganization at 295 n. 332."
1080,158," Under the plan, unlimited portability would remain in effect for one year after divestiture, except that employees in certain 
specified job categories who work on facilities shared by the Operating Company and AT&T would be granted longer portability 
entitlements.  See infra at slip op at pg. 88.  Portability would continue after the one-year ""true-up"" period among the Operating 
Companies controlled by each Regional Company. The Union objects to the elimination of unlimited portability insofar as it overrides a benefit secured previously through collective 
bargaining.  AT&T agrees with the Union that ""many of the employee protections to be provided during the true-up period are 
subject to collective bargaining"" (AT&T Response to Objections at 382 n. *) but argues that the decree requires the parties and 
the Court to set a definite time limit for the true-up period.  The Court agrees that the decree's separation between AT&T and the 
Operating Companies requires the establishment of a fixed true-up period for employee transfers, and it finds that the one year "
1081,," proposed in the plan is reasonable.  To the extent that it might be thought that this provision affects collective bargaining rights, 
such rights are superseded by the Court's power to enforce its decree. Cf.  Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U.S. 747,

greater proportion than has AT&T."
1082,169, See note 158 supra.
1082,170," It may be noted that all the transfers during the true-up period will be the result of arm's length negotiations between AT&T 
and the Operating Companies, and there is thus no occasion for either a ""post-divestiture re-evaluation plan,"" judicial 
involvement, or the appointment of special Operating Company representation, as some have suggested.  E.g., Comments of 
the State of Michigan and Michigan Public Service Commission, Feb. 11, 1983 at 30; Comments on AT&T's Plan of 
Reorganization of the Public Service Commission of the State of Missouri, February 15, 1983, at 14.  It is unclear what 
representation could be provided by the Court for companies which, after divestiture, will be independent entities. If the true-up 
process is not being conducted in accordance with the decree and the plan, ample means will be available for corrective action."
1082,171," The Court expects, as AT&T represents, that the one-year true-up period will not be used for frequent personnel transfers but 
as a ""time for correcting mistakes that are bound to occur in a reorganization of this magnitude."" AT&T Response to Objections 
at 378."
1082,172," These categories are (1) Operating Company service center employees who will write inter-LATA orders for AT&T under a 
sharing contract until such time as the contract ends and they are reassigned to AT&T, but no later than 5-1/2 years after 
divestiture; (2) AT&T operators who will provide inter-LATA Call Completion and Assistance services until Operating Companies 
establish such systems and they are reassigned to the Operating Companies, but no later than 10-1/2 years after divestiture; (3) 
Operating Company personnel who will provide circuit provisioning functions for AT&T until AT&T assumes this responsibility, 
but no later than 5-1/2 years after divestiture; and (4) employees providing installation and maintenance services for ""special 
services"" both by AT&T for Operating Companies and vice versa, until the companies provide their own services, but no later 
than 5-1/2 years after divestiture. AT&T claims that, for various reasons, it would be inefficient for AT&T and the Operating 
Companies to provide these functions independently immediately upon divestiture. See AT&T Response to Objections at 388 n."
1082,*, . 
1083,173," Under the plan, the duration of the transfer is limited to the period necessary to accomplish the change of multifunction 
facilities to exclusively AT&T or Operating Company facilities.  This will occur not later than five years and six months after 
divestiture, except for operator services personnel who may be transferred up to ten years and six months after divestiture. Plan 
of Reorganization at 287-88.  See note 172 supra."
1083,174," However, the State of New York would permit all employees in shared services to have and exercise transfer rights, as 
distinguished merely from the four categories of employees listed in the plan. "
1084,175," There is some dispute as to whether Official Services are limited to Operating Company internal communications or whether 
they include communications between an Operating Company and its customers. See AT&T Response to Objections at 95-96 n."
1084,*," ; Supplemental Affidavit of William Weiss, April 12, 1983, at 9; letter from Raymond Burke, April 13, 1983, at 2 n. *. The Court concludes that for purposes of the discussion and decision herein ""Official Services"" must properly include customer 
communications.  As Raymond Burke points out (April 13, 1983 letter at 3 n. *), no charges apply to communications which AT&T classifies as 'official' service . . . [and] even where there is a charge for 
such services as directory assistance, any inter-LATA administrative facilities involved are not 'for hire.' Similarly, Thomas Bolger notes (Amended Certification of April 6, 1983, at 5-6), a customer in Salisbury, Maryland actually speaks to a directory assistance operator in Baltimore, but that is done solely to 
facilitate the conduct of these exchange operations in efficient work groups.  The customer does not care where his call is 
answered and he pays no charge for the referral of his call from a local central office to a distant company location for this 
purpose."
1084,176, See AT&T Response to Objections at 95-96.
1084,177," The several communications from the Department of Justice to the Operating Companies may not be entirely consistent with 
regard to this subject, however."
1084,178," See Amended Certification of Thomas Bolger, April 6, 1983, at 5; letter from Raymond Burke, April 13, 1983, at 1."
1084,179," The Operating Companies manage their business through the following complex networks for the transmission of voice and 
data communications: (1) The Operational Support System Network is a network of dedicated voice and data private lines used by the Operating 
Company to monitor and control trunks and switches. These communications links are vital to the proper operation of the 
network since, for example, they enable Operating Company personnel to measure the maintenance status of trunks and 
switches and instantly to control equipment and reroute traffic. (2) The Information Processing Network is a network of dedicated data lines linking the Operating Companies' information 
system computer.  It is used to transmit data relating to customer trouble reports, service orders, trunk orders from 
interexchange carriers, and other information necessary for carrying out the Operating Companies' business. (3) Service Circuits comprise a network of largely dedicated voice lines used to receive repair calls and directory assistance 
calls from Operating Company customers. These communications ensure the maintenance of telephone service and they 
provide directory assistance to Operating Company customers. (4) Voice communications are used by the Operating Companies for hundreds of thousands of calls relating to their internal 
businesses. Supplemental Affidavit of William Weiss, April 12, 1983, at 11-12. "
1085,180," As Thomas Bolger, designated chief executive of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Company, has pointed out: In order to reduce costs and maximize efficiency, the BOCs have computer processing centers which receive billing and 
other data from company locations in a number of LATAs.  Similarly, calls from Operating Company customers seeking 
such services as directory assistance are currently routed between BOC offices to centralized locations in other LATAs. Amended Certification of Thomas Bolger, April 6, 1983, at 5."
1085,181," [***145]  The Department of Justice suggests that where Operating Company facilities are transferred to AT&T under the 
assignment process, it would be appropriate for AT&T to lease back to the Operating Company those circuits currently dedicated 
to Official use.  However, an Operating Company's ability to lease existing Official Service facilities from AT&T would be limited 
to the duration specified in the plan of reorganization for shared facilities -- that is, eight years.  See Department of Justice 
Response to Comments at 35; AT&T Response to Comments at 115; Amended Certification of Thomas Bolger, April 6, 1983, at 
5.  After this eight-year period, the Operating Companies would have to hire the services of AT&T or other interexchange 
carriers to meet all their inter-LATA Official Service needs."
1085,182," Department of Justice Response to Comments at 35.  Indeed, ironically, in spite of the fact that most Operating Company 
Official Service communications are presently conducted over facilities ""owned"" by these companies themselves, many such 
facilities would now, under the plan, be assigned to AT&T.  Supplemental Affidavit of William Weiss, April 12, 1983, at 10."
1085,183," Department of Justice Response to Comments at 35.  However, that is precisely what will happen in eight years under the 
Department's scheme.  See note 181 supra. Even during this eight-year period, any Official Service demands which cannot be 
satisfied by existing circuits leased from AT&T would have to be ""placed on"" commercial facilities of an interexchange carrier."
1085,184," In recent years, many of the Operating Companies have achieved significant cost savings through the modernization of their 
internal management processes.  Supplement to Sworn Statement of Wallace Bunn, April 7, 1983, at 5 (47,000 internal 
computer terminals in operation throughout Southeast region alone)."
1085,185," It has been estimated that for the Mid-Atlantic region alone, the total expenditures for all types of inter-LATA Official Services 
would be approximately $125 million annually.  Amended Certification of Thomas Bolger, April 6, 1983, at 6. "
1086,186," Supplemental Affidavit of William Weiss, April 12, 1983, at 13-14.  An increasing number of private corporations with 
operations dispersed over large geographic areas, such as oil companies and electric power utilities, have opted to construct 
and operate their own circuits by which their administrative communications are transmitted.  Letter from Raymond Burke, April 
13, 1983, at 2; see also, Amended Certification of Thomas Bolger, April 6, 1983, at 6; Supplement to Sworn Statement of 
Wallace Bunn, April 7, 1983, at 6."
1086,187," The Operating Companies are prohibited from providing inter-LATA telecommunications services under the decree for two 
reasons: the possibility of discriminatory interconnection practices and the possibility of subsidization of interexchange services 
with revenues from local exchange services.  See 552 F. Supp. at 188-89. Neither of these reasons is implicated by the 
ownership and operation by an Operating Company of its own inter-LATA Official Service network."
1086,188," There is also a distinct possibility that AT&T might be able to gain competitive advantages from its control over Operating 
Company official circuits.  Compare 552 F. Supp. at 181 (possible advantage to AT&T from control of electronic publishing 
business). In arguing that the Operating Companies should be able to construct and operate their own inter-LATA Official Service facilities, 
Raymond Burke wrote on April 13, 1983, at 4: Indeed, to the extent that the BOCs would need to purchase materials from facilities vendors in order to construct 
microwave, fibre, and other facilities for their administrative use, it would appear that competition in such markets would be 
enhanced.  In contrast, the Department's interpretation may create a situation in which the BOCs may, practically speaking, 
be able to obtain their administrative facilities from only one interexchange carrier -- AT&T. "
1087,189," AT&T argues to the contrary that section VIII(G) calls for the assignment to it of facilities which perform both intra-LATA and 
inter-LATA functions if the use for inter-LATA functions predominates.  AT&T Response to Objections at 97.  However, that 
section does not speak at all of inter-LATA and intra-LATA functions but states more simply that facilities . . . which serve both AT&T and one or more BOCs shall be transferred to the separated BOCs if the use made by 
such BOC or BOCs predominates over that of AT&T (emphasis added)."
1087,190," It may be that this provision will not have a significant effect on the assignment of assets because Official Services use may 
not often tip the scales as between inter-LATA and intra-LATA use.  See AT&T Response to Objections at 99."
1087,191," The Court reaches this question now, rather than after divestiture, so that the Operating Companies may be able to continue 
their essential network and operational planning. "
1088,192," The Court likewise finds not unreasonable AT&T's decision to consider predominant use as of January 1, 1984, rather than 
as of some earlier date, as several intervenors have suggested.  Network changes are, of necessity, occurring all the time, and 
most of them appear to have been planned, and partially implemented, for some time, in some instances for years.  The 
suggestion that the January 1, 1984 date gives AT&T an undue opportunity for manipulation is unrealistic and unwarranted."
1088,193," Several intervenors had originally objected to the plan's assignment of Digital Dataphone Service (DDS) facilities to AT&T.  
Subsequently AT&T accepted the Department of Justice's position with respect to such facilities, and it now appears that all DDS 
hubs, which were the focus of the intervenor's objections, will be assigned to the Operating Companies.  See Department of 
Justice Supplemental Response, June 1, 1983, at 7.  Additionally, the Department has made a commitment to review the 
contracts for the sharing of DDS facilities to ensure that the Operating Companies will have the ability to afford equal access to 
these facilities to all interexchange carriers. Id. at 8 n. *.  The Court, therefore, finds the assignment of DDS facilities to be 
consistent with the decree."
1088,194," [***148]  Unlike with respect to some other subjects (e.g., the Cambridge switch discussed at slip op. at pp. 12-13 supra) 
there is no reasonable basis for departing from the predominant use rule."
1088,195," It should also be noted that the plan of reorganization initially assigned ""Charge-A-Call"" public telephones to AT&T on the 
ground that they are used predominantly for inter-LATA communications.  However, a number of intervenors, along with several 
designated chief executives of the Regional Companies, objected to this assignment, arguing that despite the inter-LATA nature 
of the calls placed over these telephones, they are exchange facilities, having been installed by the Operating Companies as 
part of the service they provide to the public.  The Department of Justice concurred with these objections, and required the plan 
to be modified to assign Charge-A-Call public telephones to the Operating Companies.  See Department of Justice Response to 
Comments at 82-83. This modification was agreed to by AT&T and has been incorporated into the plan of reorganization. The 
Court concurs with this modification. Pursuant to the plan as so modified, the Operating Companies will be able to provide users 
with access to several interexchange carriers, while under the original plan AT&T would have limited access through these 
public telephones to its own long distance network. "
1089,196," These communities are presently served by NET facilities located outside the particular state, and NET requested the 
stateline crossings in order to continue these serving arrangements."
1089,197," The network reconfiguration costs and other network considerations are not so significant as to outweigh the discriminatory 
treatment of and the inconvenience to residents in these communitities."
1089,198," The regulatory commissions support this request. Additionally, Vermont wishes the Court to declare that these costs ought to 
be recovered through carrier access charges rather than through local rates. This is, of course, a matter for the regulatory 
commissions to execute, but the Court's views ought to be apparent from part I supra."
1089,199," NET maintains that all necessary modifications could be completed within five years, but Maine's observation that some 
localities may require less time and others more is sound. NET should submit a detailed request for exemptions to the state 
regulators and to the Department of Justice."
1089,200," A larger number of municipalities would be divided, but in all but nine communities EAS routes would enable NET to continue 
to carry traffic across the border from one side of town to the other."
1089,201," This factor alone is not significant since it may be expected that interexchange competitors will respond to consumer demand 
for special billing plans, e.g., for reduced rates on frequently called routes, in substitution or in addition to those offered by the 
local monopolist. "
1090,202," Most of these costs will be reflected in interexchange carrier access charges, not in the local rate base. Moreover, there costs 
could be spread over a number of years."
1090,203," Moreover, one of the factors cutting in favor of separating the LATA--the benefit to interexchange carriers of not having to 
compete with the Operating Company for calls between the Worcester area and the Boston/New Bedford region--is undermined 
somewhat by technical access considerations which previously were not entirely clear. If Worcester is in the same LATA as 
Boston and New Bedford, NET will offer access to interexchange carriers by means of No. 4ESS switch to be constructed in 
Framingham. If Worcester is placed in a separate Central Massachusetts LATA, two smaller switches will be built in 
Framingham and Worcester. NET insists that the existing cross bar switch in Worcester could not be upgraded to serve as an 
access tandem, and although this assertion is challenged by Southern Pacific Communications Corp., the Court is not prepared 
to override the Operating Company on so technical a point."
1090,204," Supporting the Department's position is the fact that the access provided for calls within a single LATA would not include a 
presubscription option while calls between Worcester and Boston, were each city in a separate LATA, would include such an 
option.  The choice is thus between access via a No. 4ESS switch (see note 203 supra) and a larger area in which 
presubscription will not be available, on the one hand, and access via an inferior switch and greater availability of 
presubscription, on the other.  Based on the comments the Court has received, it is reasonable to expect that the former would 
do more for competition than would the latter."
1090,205," The various requests for exceptions contained in the October 4, 1982 applications also are granted, except that New York 
Telephone will not be serving Wells, Vermont.  See slip op. at pp. 104-05 supra."
1090,206," The revised count is 97,000, as opposed to 200,000. "
1091,207," The Utica area contains 110,000 phones, according to New York Telephone, down from the 120,000 the Company previously 
reported."
1091,208, The Court also approves the boundaries of the new Poughkeepsie LATA as proposed by New York Telephone Co.
1091,209," A small portion of the Pittsburgh LATA, the Greensburg area, will be accessed by a 1AESS, 2-wire machine.  This is 
satisfactory since AT&T and its competitors will all be served by means of this switch, so that there will be no quality differences 
among them."
1091,210," The Department informs the Court that South Central Bell and GTE agree to an association of GTE's Lexington 264,864 main 
stations and South Central Bell's 165,000 Winchester stations.  This association will ensure that the Winchester area will be 
attractive to interexchange carriers -- the primary concern that prompted the Court to require the consolidation of the Winchester 
and Louisville LATAs.  The Louisville LATA has more than enough stations -- 430,000 -- to enable it to stand on its own. "
1092,211," The Court accepts the reasons for this action provided by Illinois Bell, the Illinois Commerce Commission, and the 
Department of Justice."
1092,212," The Court agrees in this regard with the reasoning of the Michigan Telephone Company, the Michigan Public Service 
Commission, the State of Michigan, and the Department of Justice."
1092,213," This approval is granted for the reasons stated in the Court's April 20 Opinion and the filing of the Department of Justice.  The 
approval is conditioned, however, upon Michigan's undertaking to implement its plans to have certain Michigan Bell exchanges 
home on the new GTE Three Rivers switch."
1092,214, This approval is in accordance with the recommendations of Southwestern Bell and the Department of Justice.
1092,215, This division was required by the Court's April 20 Opinion.
1092,216, The Court accepts the reasoning of the Wisconsin Telephone Company.
1092,217, This division was likewise required by the April 20 Opinion.
1092,218," Northwestern Bell currently serves the five Minnesota border communities from facilities located in North Dakota.  Under the 
previous proposal of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, the communities would have been included in the Brainerd 
LATA, obliging Northwestern Bell to rewire the communities to facilities on the Minnesota side of the border."
1092,219," The Department of Justice has withdrawn the reservations it initially expressed over inclusion of the Bellingham area in the 
Seattle LATA, noting that although the independently served expanse between Bellingham and Seattle is large geographically, it 
contains only about 20,000 subscribers. "
1093,220," Moreover, to the extent that the rates are set above cost, the presence of competitors in the corridors will exert pressure on 
the Operating Companies and the FCC to reduce the price of corridor service."
1093,221, The intra-LATA equal access requirement does not apply to non-toll calls. 
1094,222," The latter would also have to be accompanied by a prefix ""1"" in those areas where an area code must be distinguished from 
a local exchange code."
1094,223," This is because the end office would require revised computer software that could determine when a call was designated for 
a termination point within its LATA and when it was destined for a point in another LATA."
1094,224," Microtel, Inc. argues that with equal access should come a more uniform starting point for intra-LATA competition.  We have no illusion that the 
BOCs will not continue to enjoy significant competitive advantages arising from their historical relationship with customers "
1095,," and their dominant position in the . . . market.  But those advantages should not be solidified by an additional head start 
arising from carriage of undesignated intra-LATA traffic. Opposition dated May 16, 1983, at 14.  There is some merit to that argument, particularly in states where the Court approved 
large LATAs on the expectation that there would not be significant barriers to intra-LATA competition.  Microtel's primary state of 
operation, Florida, is a case in point.  The Court allowed the consolidation of three SMSAs to form the Southeast LATA (Miami, 
West Palm Beach, and Ft. Pierce) with the understanding that there would be intra-LATA competition for calls between these 
cities."
1095,225," Due to the availability of presubscription in inter-LATA calls, someone who had preselected an interexchange carrier would 
not have to dial an access code and he therefore could dial across the country with fewer digits than within his own LATA."
1095,226, [***154]  The Commission has under review whether also to license MCI for intrastate telecommunications traffic.
1095,227," See, e.g., Comments of Maine.  The situation may well be different with respect to undesignated inter-LATA calls.  It would 
seem to be inconsistent with the decree for AT&T automatically to receive inter-LATA calls dialed either mistakenly or ignorantly 
without an access code (for those calls not dialed pursuant to a presubscription).  The Operating Companies in that event would 
have two options: they could prevent an undesignated inter-LATA call from being completed (by obliging the caller to dial again 
using a proper access code) or they could allocate undesignated calls among all interexchange carriers on the basis of some 
formula.  This subject is not dealt with at all in the plan of reorganization; moreover, the Operating Companies have not yet 
formulated their own policies, and they have not advised the Court as to the practical implications of various options.  The Court 
will therefore defer a decision on this subject.  If the Operating Companies should improperly discriminate among carriers with 
respect to undesignated calls, remedies will be available through the Department of Justice and the Court."
1095,228," The corridors, as indicated at slip op. pp. 115-16 supra, run from the five boroughs of New York City into five northern New 
Jersey counties, and between five Eastern Pennsylvania counties into three southern New Jersey counties. "
1096,229," As evident from the filings, the Operating Companies intend to charge competitors inter-LATA access tariffs even though they 
would not be receiving inter-LATA-type access."
1096,230," In the case of the corridors, it is appropriate that the Operating Companies undertake the responsibility for advertising what 
they claim to be their less expensive, exceptional service and instructing business and residential users on how to take 
advantage of it.  Since many of the users of these routes are businesses, which may be expected to be very cost conscious, the 
Operating Companies should presumably have little trouble in inducing them to dial four additional numbers (in the event that, as 
many assume, that Operating Company will not be the one preselected by the user) if that would save them money."
1096,231," AT&T states that the Operating Companies alone classified the traffic between their respective LATAs and adjacent 
independent territories, without interference from AT&T.  AT&T Response to Comments, March 25, 1983, at 5 n.**."
1096,232," There are some 1425 independent telephone companies which provide local phone service in 11,000 of the 18,000 local 
exchanges in the United States.  Objections of the United States Independent Telephone Assoc., March 15, 1983, at 2.  The 
geographic areas where the Independents provide service are, in total, larger than those where the Bell Operating Companies 
provide local service; although the Independent territories are generally more sparsely populated, encompassing only 20 percent 
of the telephones in the nation."
1096,233, This would be so even where highly integrated communities are involved.
1096,234," Under the terminology used by the parties, if a particular Independent territory is considered to be ""associated"" with the 
adjacent Operating Company LATA, then telecommunications traffic between these two areas is regarded as intra-LATA and 
may be handled by the Operating Company.  If, on the other hand, a particular Independent territory is considered to be ""not 
associated"" with an Operating Company LATA, then the Operating Company would be prohibited under section II(D) of the 
decree from carrying traffic between the two areas, as this would be regarded as an inter-LATA service. "
1097,235," Letter from James P. Denvir to Jim G. Kilpatric, November 17, 1982, at 3-7."
1097,236," The Department of Justice as well as the states involved oppose these classifications on the ground that even though the 
decree cannot impose a requirement that an Operating Company actually provide service to an area which it is permitted to 
serve, the purpose of the classifications is to define areas which the Operating Companies may serve.  In that view, the 
particular traffic should be classified as intra-LATA and it would then be left to the state and federal regulators to determine 
whether the Operating Companies or any other carriers should be obligated to serve particular areas.  See Department of 
Justice Response to Comments, April 4, 1983, at 8; State of Oregon Comments, March 15, 1983, at 3-5.  The Court finds the 
position taken by the Department of Justice in this regard to be correct, since it will best ensure that the decree does not 
unnecessarily intrude upon the jurisdiction of the regulatory commissions to determine service responsibilities within their 
jurisdictions.  Accordingly, the Operating Company classifications are hereby required to be modified to conform to the 
Department's position. "
1098,237," However, for the purpose of determining whether the Operating Company may serve these areas, the traffic between the two 
areas will be classified as intra-LATA.  Thus, if in the future an Operating Company wishes to provide service to such 
Independent areas, it will be free to do so.  This minor category of classifications is, in essence, simply a request by the 
particular Operating Company for an exception to the general rule that it be assigned Bell System facilities devoted to intra-LATA 
service.  Instead, AT&T will be assigned these facilities which the Operating Companies do not intend to use.  See Department 
of Justice Response to Comments, April 4, 1983, at 9-10.  No objections have been raised with respect to this exception to the 
general rule for the division of Bell System assets, and it is, therefore, approved."
1098,238," It has also been argued that the Court should require that an opportunity be afforded the intervenors to seek reclassification 
of Bell-Independent traffic after divestiture. There is no basis for such a request, and it will be denied along with all other 
demands for systematic post-divestiture proceedings.  See Part IX infra. However, the Bell Operating Companies may, under the 
decree, subsequently petition the Court for reclassification or for exceptions in regard to service between their own areas and 
Independent territory."
1098,239," It is questionable whether, in view of the relatively limited impact of these classifications upon the intervenors (see infra), a 
level of scrutiny comparable to that employed with respect to the LATA classifications themselves was required."
1098,240," No objections were raised to the vast majority of Independent exchanges that have been classified as ""associated."" It is to be 
noted that only 940 out of the 11,000 Independent exchanges are classified as ""not associated"" to any Bell Operating Company 
LATA.  Objections of the United States Independent Telephone Assoc., March 15, 1983, at 4 n.*."
1098,241," In the few instances, such as those discussed in note 236 supra, where the Department of Justice and the Operating 
Companies took different positions with respect to whether particular traffic should be classified as intra-LATA or inter-LATA, the 
Court agrees with the position of the Department, and the classifications should, accordingly, be modified to conform to that 
position."
1098,242," Several intervenors argue that, although the associations being decided now have limited purposes under the decree, they 
will be ""frozen in time"" for state and federal regulatory bodies, common carriers, Independents, and ratepayers.  See GTE 
Comments of March 15, 1983, at 3.  There is nothing in the plan of reorganization which the Court is approving which has such 
wide consequences.  If others decide to accept the decisions made herein, that would be their decision; it can hardly be a basis 
upon which the Court would be justified in rejecting the plan.  Nothing in the Court's approval of the Bell-Independent 
classifications is intended in any way to restrict the regulatory bodies in the exercise of their legitimate authority. "
1099,243," Moreover, regardless whether traffic is classified as intra-LATA or inter-LATA, Independents will have the option of 
establishing a relationship with an Operating Company whereby the Independent would be the carrier of traffic between its 
territory and the Operating Company LATA.  See United States v. Western Electric Co., 569 F. Supp. 990, 1010; 1983-1 Trade 
Cas. P65,333, at 69,982-83 (D.D.C. 1983). If the Independent does not wish to carry such traffic itself, it will alternatively be able 
to enter into a service arrangement with AT&T (in which case it could continue to interconnect with the same Bell System 
facilities as are presently used for its interexchange of traffic with Bell territory) or any other interexchange carrier. AT&T 
Response to Comments, March 25, 1983, at 12."
1099,244," Similarly, GTE's complaints regarding splintering of trunk groups, duplication of facilities, and stranding of existing facilities 
are basically inevitable consequences of the decree insofar as it does not permit the Bell Operating Companies to carry 
interexchange traffic."
1099,245, Section I(A)(1) permits AT&T to transfer resources to such an entity.
1099,246," Of the total 8,800, approximately 6,600 staff members would perform technical functions.  Plan of Reorganization at 239."

make substantive procurement decisions."
1100,252," The Court has some concern that the centralized provision of legal advice on potential antitrust liability might be of 
questionable propriety and wisdom.  William Weiss, designated chief executive of the Midwest Region, testified at the June 2, 
1983 hearing that: ""I cannot conceive of a corporation the size of mine in the future not wanting to be self-sufficient in areas of 
liability like antitrust . . . ."" Transcript at 25497.  Although this is not a complete answer, the likelihood of antitrust violations 
through the central legal staff is not sufficiently substantial that elimination of these functions will be required."
1100,253," The delegation of national security and emergency responsibilities to the CSO is largely unchallenged.  The Court has always 
insisted that legitimate Department of Defense interests be fully protected (552 F. Supp. at 208-209), and the CSO provisions of 
the plan carry out that objective.  The security and emergency responsibilities will be executed by a specialized group within the 
CSO which will set and enforce technical standards to the extent that security and emergency needs demand that telephone 
equipment be ""capable of being interconnected nationwide."" Plan of Reorganization at 418-19."
1100,254," Several intervenors complain that the plan makes insufficient provision for an Operating Company's withdrawal from the 
CSO.  Complete withdrawal may only take place with five years' advance notice, and an Operating Company may withdraw from 
a particular function on one year's notice.  The chief executives of the Regional Companies support this approach as necessary 
to ensure the continuing viability of the CSO, and the Court sees no reason to interfere with their judgment."
1100,255," William Weiss stated that the amount will be three-quarters of the sums previously expended (transcript at 25,500), while 
AT&T claims that the 8,800 CSO employees should be compared to the 23,000 AT&T employees allegedly now supporting the 
Operating Companies.  Response to Objections at 496 note **."
1100,256," A task force of Operating Company presidents initially recommended the structure of the CSO.  Each regional planner on the

elected to do only certain things in the central staff, those things that they felt could be done to achieve economies of scale.  
They excluded from the role of that central staff things that they felt either we could do ourselves with our present organizations

1101,259," Some of the state regulatory commissions complain that they will be unable to exercise effective control over the costs of the 
CSO, but this was refuted by testimony at the June 2, 1983, hearing to the effect that the Operating Companies will present their 
respective shares of the cost of the CSO to the state regulators, so that ""it will not escape [their] attention."" Transcript at 25,501."

1102,265, See GTE Reply at 8.
1102,266," Since the representations made by AT&T in its Response to Objections regarding the limited role of the CSO in setting 
standards and testing products were critical in persuading the Department of Justice and the Court to approve the CSO as 
proposed, it is of course essential that the CSO abide by those representations.  The Court has considered adopting the 
suggestion of some (e.g., U.S. Telephone Suppliers Association) that these representations be reduced to a separate contract, 
but in the interest of avoiding the imposition of yet another set of rules on the Operating Companies, it will not insist on this 
measure.  However, the Court does expect the Operating Companies to use the CSO to further only their own competitive 
interests, not those of AT&T, and it also expects the Department of Justice to be vigilant in its oversight of the CSO's role in the 
setting of standards and testing of products. The plan of reorganization does not limit the CSO to the responsibilities initially entrusted to it.  The Court is persuaded that 
some flexibility is necessary in this regard as well.  However, here, too, it expects that the CSO will respect the boundaries 
between standards and testing, on the one hand, and procurement, on the other.  It is in this area particularly that the Court will 
not hesitate to exercise the powers vested in it by section VIII(I) of the decree should this appear to be warranted."
1102,267," Whatever sharing contracts that will be in effect will be between the Operating Companies and AT&T, not the CSO and

traditionally existed within the Bell System."
1103,271," As for the claim that the very establishment of a CSO might give rise to antitrust problems it is well established that a joint

1104,278," The Court subsequently required the adoption of section VIII(I) which permits the Court to undertake the various section VII 
responsibilities (except that of modifying the decree) sua sponte, rather than merely upon request."
1104,279," Such a party may serve upon the Department of Justice a request for enforcement.  If the Department refuses to take action 
in response thereto, an application may be made to the Court for the initiation of ""further appropriate proceedings."" The process 
was carefully restricted to complaints accompanied by affidavits alleging facts with particularity which, if true, would demonstrate 
a bad faith refusal by the Department to enforce the judgment.  552 F. Supp. at 220. The Court will in due course issue an 
implementing order, and it will not entertain enforcement requests which do not follow this route."
1104,280," E.g., the size of the divestiture, the sketchy nature of the decree itself, and, ultimately, the broad implications of the divestiture 
upon the entire telecommunications industry. "
1105,281," E.g., the attempts of the Department of Justice, of AT&T, or both, to disavow commitments previously made with respect to 
patent and trademark rights to be granted to the Operating Companies (see Parts III and IV supra) and the continuing reluctance 
of the Department to accept as final the decision regarding the marketing of CPE by the Operating Companies.  See pp. 73-74 
supra. That reluctance gives rise to some concern regarding the Department's willingness and ability to enforce fairly the CPE 
provisions of the decree (rather than to seek, once again, to pursue its own notions in that regard) and this, of course, casts 
some doubt upon the Department's overall attitude with respect to the implementation of the decree. However, in these respects, 
too, the various judicial powers enumerated above are adequate to deal with any recalcitrance, whatever form it may take."
1105,282," It should also be noted that independent auditors and actuaries will verify compliance by AT&T and the Operating Companies 
with the requirements of the plan of reorganization regarding the assignment of assets and liabilities.  AT&T Response to 
Objections at 355-60."
1105,283," For similar reasons, the Court rejects the request of the State of California that the prices charged by Western Electric be 
controlled for a period following divestiture (Further Comments of the People of the State of California, Feb. 4, 1983, at 41); the 
request of the State of Missouri to provide special representation for the Operating Companies in the form of an independent 
attorney (Motion of the State of Missouri for a Hold Separate Order, April 13, 1983); and the request of New York City for the 
appointment of a Special Master pursuant to Rule 53 (Comments of the City of New York, Feb. 14, 1983, at p. 4).  Suggestions 
similar to these were considered and rejected by the Court prior to the entry of the decree (552 F. Supp. at 166, 220-22). No new 
grounds have been adduced; indeed, the Operating Companies have not been reticent in recent months to advance their views 
to the Court, often contradicting those of AT&T.  As the Operating Companies progress further on the road to independence, 
they may be expected to be increasingly strong-willed in protecting their rights vis-a-vis AT&T. "
1106,284," The 471-page plan is a blueprint for the largest corporate reorganization in United States history.  The decree itself describes 
the reorganization process only in the most general terms."
1106,285," Many of the submissions of the parties and the intervenors (e.g., states, AT&T's competitors, consumer groups) were detailed 
and voluminous.  For example, one intervenor -- MCI -- filed a total of over 850 pages of memoranda, exhibits, and other 
documents, and AT&T's March 1983 Response alone was 617 pages in length.  For the first time in the Bell System 
reorganization process, the Operating Companies participated in the judicial proceedings in their own right.  A hearing was held 
on June 2, 1983, at which the parties, several intervenors, and the chief executives of the Regional Companies gave their views 
on several particularly controversial issues.  See notes 3 and 4 supra."
1106,286," The Court's powers under the Tunney Act are, of course, limited (see 552 F. Supp. at 151) and in passing upon the plan of 
reorganization, the Court likewise does not write on a clean slate but must conform to the provisions and principles of the decree 
itself."
1106,287," Among the actions which tended to further the cause of competition were the approval of the divestiture from AT&T of the 
twenty-two ""bottleneck"" local companies, the prohibition on the entry of these companies into business ventures where their 
monopoly status might have given them an improper advantage, and the requirement that these companies must provide equal 
access to all of AT&T's interexchange competitors. The Court also prohibited AT&T for a period of seven years from entering the 
electronic publishing market. Actions designed to preserve AT&T's effectiveness included the rejection of proposals which would have required that company 
to divest itself of Western Electric and Bell Laboratories, prohibited it from utilizing sophisticated ""bypass"" technologies, and 
otherwise limited the scope of its operations.  The Court also approved the removal of the restrictions imposed upon AT&T by 
the 1956 consent decree. The vitality of the Operating Companies and the goal of universal telephone service were promoted, inter alia, by modifications 
which permitted the entry of the local companies into the printed advertising directory market and customer premises equipment 
market."
1106,288," These actions will, of course, to some degree affect existing and potential competitors of AT&T, suppliers of products, and 
others within and without the telecommunications industry.  But in passing upon the plan of reorganization, the Court was 
principally called upon to decide ""internal"" matters between AT&T and the Operating Companies, and for that reason it is not 
particularly surprising that the primary impact of the decision is on the local companies and their financial well-being."
1106,289," This is not to say that other objectives were not advanced.  Thus, the Court approved much of the AT&T plan, and it rejected 
proposals which would have improperly saddled AT&T with substantial costs, e.g., the direct costs of providing equal access and 
reconfiguring the network (Part I(C) of this Opinion) and the sole financial responsibility for the Bell System's contingent antitrust 
liabilities (Part II).  In order further to promote competition in telecommunications services, the Court, inter alia, rejected joint use 
by AT&T and the Operating Companies of the name ""Bell"" (Part III(A)), required the access the Operating Companies provide to 
AT&T's competitors to be of sufficiently high quality so that voice and data customers will be unable to detect any difference "
1107,," (Part I(A)), and required the provision of equal access in the intra-LATA field and the densely populated ""corridors"" in the New 
York-New Jersey-Philadelphia areas (Part VII(B)).  In the interest of protecting the rights of AT&T employees, the Court made 
explicit that with respect to various subjects (e.g., pension benefits) the decree does not relieve AT&T of its obligation to bargain 
collectively.  (Part V(A))."
1107,290," Cost reductions need not, and in the Court's view will not, be achieved at the expense of quality and reliability.  See Part VIII 
of the Opinion where the Court approved the setting of uniform standards so as to maintain the quality of the telephone network."
1107,291," A number of interexchange carriers and telephone equipment manufacturers and dealers have entered these fields or have 
vastly expanded their operations.  The result has been that the prices of long distance service and customer premises 
equipment are falling and that telephone and related apparatus are becoming available in unprecedented varieties.  These 
trends may be expected to continue and, indeed, to accelerate."
1107,292," See, e.g., Department of Justice Supplemental Memorandum, June 10, 1983, at 8 (decree will not, and has not, caused 
adverse effects on local rates); AT&T Response of May 5, 1983, at 10-21 (local rates are going up but not because of 
divestiture); see also, Response of the Federal Communications Commission, June 13, 1983, at 4 n.5 (FCC decision not a 
product of divestiture since Commission had proposed customer access charges well before Court accepted decree)."
1107,293, See 47 U.S.C. § 402.
1107,294," Requests for rate increases by local telephone companies are apparently sought to be justified in some instances by 
references to the divestiture. Such reliance is unjustified.  See note 292 supra."
1107,295, 552 F. Supp. at 164-65. 
1108,296," See, e.g., Fortune, Breaking Up The Phone Company, June 27, 1983."
1108,297," The Court assumed control of this case in the summer of 1978.  Pretrial proceedings were designed and announced in 
September of that year (461 F. Supp. 1314), and they took a little over two years to complete.  Trial began in January 1981, and 
it was within weeks of completion when, in January 1982, the parties settled the case by the consent decree referred to above."
1108,298," Issues relating to the LATAs are not a part of the plan of reorganization as such.  However, the Court expects compliance 
with the decisions made with respect to such issues in the Opinion of April 20, 1983, and the present Opinion.  It also expects 
the parties to comply with the other directions contained in these two documents."
1108,299, All such modifications will supersede the existing provisions of the plan of reorganization to the extent of any inconsistency.
1108,300," Section VIII(J) of the decree provides that the plan of reorganization ""shall not be implemented until approved by the Court as 
being consistent with the provisions and principles of the decree."" The Court considers that the plan will not be consistent with 
the decree until modified as required herein. "
1109,1," This Modification reads as follows: If by January 1, 1994, the Operating Companies in the aggregate have not recovered the costs of providing equal access 
and network reconfiguration (as defined in AT&T's Consolidated Application filed with the Federal Communications 
Commission on March 1, 1983), plus financing expenses, through their collection of access charges from the interexchange 
carriers, AT&T will reimburse the Operating Companies in the amount of any remaining deficit.  For purposes of this 
provision, 'costs' shall mean the actual costs incurred by the Operating Companies, as distinguished from the estimates in 
the Consolidated Application.  A preliminary accounting will be provided to the Court at the close of the Operating 
Companies' equal access and network reconfiguration program or by January 1, 1989, whichever is earlier, and a final 
accounting not later than January 1, 1994."
1109,2, Other points made by AT&T essentially relate to the request for a proviso to the Modification and are considered under II infra.
1109,3," AT&T also claims that the issue was not briefed or otherwise considered prior to the Court's decision on July 8, 1983, but this 
claim is difficult to understand.  Dozens of memoranda with supporting materials were submitted to the Court on the question 
whether the access costs should more appropriately fall on AT&T or on the Operating Companies, and this was also one of the 
subjects on which argument and testimony were adduced at the June 2, 1983 hearing. "
1110,4," While all interexchange carriers will pay such access charges, AT&T, as the largest carrier, will contribute the lion's share."
1110,5, AT&T Memorandum at 3-4; Department of Justice Response at 2.
1110,6," Moreover, as the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) points out, it would be fundamentally unfair if AT&T, whose interstate toll operations were sheltered by the refusal to provide equal 
access, should be allowed to unload the massive costs of complying with the decree upon the BOCs. Response at 2.  On this basis, the Court also rejects AT&T's demand that it strike the reference in the July 8, 1983, Opinion to 
AT&T's prior obligation to provide equal or substantially equal access.  Motion at slip op. at p. 607 note *.  If this issue should 
arise in other, private litigation, the tribunals having jurisdiction will, of course, draw their own conclusions based on their 
understanding of court and FCC precedents."
1110,7," This would lower rates and thus stimulate usage, and it would also tend to divert the equal access obligation from the local 
companies to AT&T."
1110,8, The resulting lower intra-LATA toll rates would obviously be popular with the public the regulators serve.
1110,9," To the extent that AT&T, as a result of the guarantee, ultimately paid for the costs of providing equal access, its competitors 
would be relieved of the obligation of paying for that access through interexchange access charges. "
1111,10," Compare, e.g., section I(A)(1) with Appendix B."
1111,11," Essentially, the protection of AT&T is accomplished in the proviso by the clauses relieving AT&T of its obligation if the 
Operating Companies fail to file access charge tariffs designed to recover all costs included within the guarantee, or if the 
regulators refuse to allow such tariffs to take effect."
1111,12," E.g., Maine, p. 2; NARUC, pp. 4-7; GTE, p. 7; SBS, p. 2."
1111,13," In the event that at the conclusion of the guarantee period, there is a dispute as to the cause of any shortfall, the Court will 
resolve that dispute as provided for on p. slip op. at 19 of the Opinion of July 8, 1983."
1111,14," The proviso proposed by AT&T includes a footnote which reads as follows: To the extent that network reconfiguration costs relate to the BOCs' provision of other services (such as intra-LATA toll), 
rather than to carrier access services, the BOCs will be required to include such costs in tariffs for those other services 
which are filed and allowed to become effective in accordance with this proviso, and any amounts thus recovered shall 
count toward reimbursement of the BOCs' costs of network reconfiguration. "
1112,," Network facilities to be constructed will, of course, be used in part for services other than interexchange access (e.g., for intra-
LATA access or intra-LATA toll services), and accordingly a portion of the investment in these facilities will normally be 
recovered from services other than such access.  On this basis, it is appropriate, therefore, that any funds received by the 
Operating Companies from these other sources be counted toward AT&T's reimbursement obligation.  It was for this reason that 
the Court required in its July 8, 1983 Opinion that the Operating Companies keep records to isolate access expenses from 
expenses they would have incurred in any event (Opinion at slip op. at 19 note 37), and it is on the same basis that it approves 
the inclusion of this footnote. It should be noted that this provision will not compel regulators to determine that any portion of network reconfiguration costs 
relates to services other than carrier access services; it simply provides that if the regulators make such determinations, AT&T 
will be protected from having to pay under the guarantee even though, in reality, there was no deficit."
1112,15," The Court recognizes that one consideration cuts the other way: a ten-year schedule, as California points out (Opposition at 
7), may inflate the Operating Companies' annual access costs in the near term.  However, that increase in costs must be kept in 
perspective.  Even if $3 billion will have to be recovered in the ten-year period, the total amount would still only be two percent of 
the over $150 billion that is estimated to be collected by the Operating Companies in access charges.  See Department of 
Justice Response, Attachment B at 6.  Thus, the effect on rates of a ten-year recovery period vs. some longer period would not 
be substantial, and even that effect could further be mitigated by the regulators."
1112,16," For the same reason, the Court rejects the suggestion of the United Church of Christ (Opposition at 8) that AT&T be relieved 
of the guarantee only to the extent that the Operating Companies may be able to recover costs after 1994."
1112,17," This solution also appropriately meets concerns expressed by the Federal Communications Commission (Comments at 2) and 
by NARUC (Response at 5) that the Court's decision might improperly interfere with the authority of the regulators."
1112,18," Several of the intervenors propose various measures in other areas of the plan of reorganization in order to counterbalance 
what they regard as the effects of the proviso.  Thus, California proposes (Opposition at 9-10) that the Court assign the so-called 
""Account 232"" to AT&T, and MCI suggests (Opposition at 3) that the Court's modification with respect to patent licensing will 
have a beneficial impact on the recovery of the access costs.  The plan of reorganization, as it was required to be modified in the 
July 8, 1983 Opinion, is carefully balanced to achieve the decree's purposes and objectives.  The proviso is not sufficiently 
significant to call that balance into question and thus to provoke reconsideration of other aspects of the plan. California also suggests (Opposition at 5-6) that "
1113,," [throughout] the nation, BOCs are presenting regulatory authorities with rate increase proposals requesting not only 
substantial increases in total revenue but also drastically restructured rate designs, featuring 100 to 300 percent increases 
in basic monthly rates . . ., occasional reductions in toll rates [and] substantial customer access line charges . . . . To the extent that these requests are claimed to be based on the divestiture as presently structured, they have no justification."
1113,1," To the extent that motions or individual arguments made in motions are not addressed herein, they either raise issues which 
were previously fully considered or are deemed to lack merit for other reasons.  However, the Operating Companies' proposed 
provision of cellular radio services across LATA boundaries, which is not part of the plan of reorganization but constitutes a 
request for an exception under Section VIII(C) of the decree, will be considered at a later time."
1113,2," The provisions in the plan regarding computer software represent complex arrangements some of which were substantially 
modified by AT&T following Department of Justice objections.  See, e.g., Response of Department of Justice to Comments at 
144-52. "

1128,2," The district court also rested its summary judgment ruling for Loral and Conic on the unfair competition claim on the basis that 
Aydin failed to demonstrate that the agreement with Moyes was unlawful.  We do not address this aspect of the district court's 
ruling because we affirm the summary judgment on the unfair competition claim on another basis. "
1135,1," Plaintiffs did not allege that they would have dissolved the partnership if they had been aware earlier of Properties' negotiations 
with Realty.  Apparently, in light of the total absence of such evidence in this case they did not even request a jury instruction or 
interrogatory on this issue.  Properties' failure to notify Plaintiffs on the subject negotiations caused no damage to any 
complaining party.  Plaintiffs' financial disappointments are exclusively attributable to the exercise by Properties of its legitimate 
power of termination."
1135,2," Overwhelming evidence adduced at trial indicated that before dissolution in June, 1976, the partners or joint venturers shared 
expenses according to their respective ownership interests in the venture except that Properties paid much more than its share 
of the March 1, 1976, option payment made by the venture. See Dx. W 116, W 114, W 80.  Further, under 
TEX.REV.CIV.STAT.ANN. art. 6132b, § 18(1)(f), no partner is entitled to remuneration for acting in the partnership business 
unless the partners specifically agree to the contrary.  No such agreement was made.  Defendants retained no partnership 
property.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have not shown that they are entitled to an ccounting, see section 22, and, in fact, have not 
requested one. "
1136,3," In point of fact Properties' purchase of a parcel of land at Greenspoint was not in competition with the development goals of the 
FM 1960 venture. Properties has not acted as a mall developer or shared in such profits at Greenspoint.  See note 4, infra. "
1137,4," The constructive trust remedy is unavailable whether requested by Plaintiffs or not.  The goal of the FM 1960 venture was to 
develop the land at that location so that mall space could be rented and improved land surrounding the proposed mall could be 
sold. Properties, however, has never had an interest in the mall or surrounding land at Greenspoint which could be shared with 
Plaintiffs.  Just as it was envisioned that Plaintiffs would have no interest in the land upon which the planned Montgomery Ward 
Store at FM 1960 was to have been built, they have no present claim to the land upon which the Ward store is now located at 
Greenspoint Mall."
1137,5," This conclusion is sound even though ""[t]here are frequent expressions in [Texas] judicial opinions that ""malice"" is requisite 
[and substantially sufficient] for liability."" RESTATEMENT § 766 Comment s.  Review of the Texas cases, however, confirms the 
conclusion that generally ""what is meant is not malice in the sense of ill will but merely ""intentional interference without 
justification,"" Id., or the use of ""wrongful means"" of competition by the defendant.  See RESTATEMENT § 768(1)(a).  The 
determination whether interference was achieved without justification or by use of wrongful means is one for the Court at least in 
such a case as this which involves no dispute concerning the means employed to effect the alleged, competitive interference."
1137,6," Plaintiffs have failed to allege or show that they suffered any damages as a result of any alleged interference which occurred 
before Properties withdrew from the joint venture. All the claimed damages are attributible solely to Properties' entirely proper 
withdrawal from the venture which subsequently caused the failure of the development with consequential loss of envisioned 
profits.  In this case, because the alleged interference resulted from proper competitive efforts by the Federated Defendants, 
Plaintiffs were not wronged and are not entitled to damages.  RESTATEMENT § 768(1) Comment i. "
1138,7," Plaintiffs' claim that Defendants created or continued an unlawful restraint of trade is discussed and rejected in the final part of 
this opinion.  See RESTATEMENT § 768(1)(c). "
1140,8," United States v. Continental Can Co., supra, dealt with section 7, Clayton Act, but for purposes of product market definition 
there is little or no reason to distinguish cases applying that section and section 2, Sherman Act. See United States v. Grinnell 
Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 572-73 (1966). "
1141,9," United States v. Continental Can Co., supra, at 452-53. "
1143,10," Id. at 456.  It was uncontroverted that the average (not maximum) driving time of the patrons who shopped at Greenspoint was 
twenty-two minutes. See R. 618."
1143,11," The entire greater urban and suburban areas of Minneapolis, Forth Worth, San Antonio and Detroit were considered as

1143,12," All the listed malls are located on interstate highway systems and are well within 30 minutes driving time of Greenspoint given 
the non-stop nature of automobile travel on such highways. "
1144,13," On the contrary, Plaintiffs' complaint claimed that a major mall developer (Simon) and two major department stores (Sakowitz 
and Joskes) were quite willing to deal with Plaintiffs.  Evidence adduced at trial showed that it was possible to develop a large 
shopping center without the presence of Sears, J.C. Penney or Wards.  See Dx. F 126 at 4-5.  The evidence failed to show any 
agreement to limit any store's option to deal with Plaintiffs in any location at any time including the future.  The evidence also 
showed that Plaintiffs failed to contact stores which are now located in Houston and which might have located with them.  
Finally, if the interest to be considered is the freedom to participate in the business of regional center development, Plaintiffs are 
not unreasonably restrained since as discussed, supra, the Court found that development business to be one conducted in a 
state or nationwide area in which other opportunities were available. "
1145,14," Antitrust claims or theories not specifically alleged are deemed waived after the conclusion of trial.  See Sulmeyer v. Coca 
Cola Co., 515 F.2d 835, 846 (5th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 934 (1976). See also Associated Carpenters,    U.S.   , 103 
S.Ct. 897 (1983), 51 U.S.L.W. 4139, 4141 (1983). "
1146,15," Even if Ward's decision to move to Greenspoint had resulted in overconcentration of sellers vis a vis available buyers 
(shoppers), or had been inefficient in some other way, that agreement still would not present an anti-competitive threat to the 
market.  Such an inefficient decision would increase the competitive opportunities of others in the area to construct decentralized 
retail establishments.  Also, those entities responsible for the inefficient decision would not be shielded from the adverse 
economic consequences of their choice. "
1148,16," The fact that Ward may have had some horizontal association in mall development does not preclude application of the rule of 
reason.  If Ward and Federated had gone so far as to merge, a circumstance involving much more extensive horizontal 
agreement and cooperation than was present here, their actions still would be judged by the rule.  See United States v. General 
Dynamics Corp., 415 U.S. 486 (1974) (section 7 Clayton Act); United States v. Columbia Steel Co., 334 U.S. 495 (1948) (section 
1 Sherman Act).  Ward, of course, had important economic considerations relating to its competitiveness as a merchandiser to 
consider in choosing between Plaintiffs' and Federated's site. In moving to Greenspoint, Ward did not gain a share of the 
development project, but simply purchased a pad upon which to build its store.  Just as importantly, Ward continued to maintain 
operation of its store at the Northline Shopping Center which was located only about ten minutes driving time away from 
Greenspoint.  Northline and other centers in the relevant market which contain Ward stores are important competitors of 
Greenspoint. "
1150,*," District Judge of the Western District of Louisiana, sitting by designation. "
1151,1," The House Report on the Bill ultimately enacted into law states that the thrust of the legislation is to overturn the decision in 
California v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 474 F.2d 774 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 908, 93 S. Ct. 2291, 36 L. Ed. 2d 974 (1973). The 
Court in Frito-Lay had held that the State of California lacked standing to sue to recover treble damages as parens patriae on 
behalf of its citizens for antitrust injuries.  The House Report, after quoting from Frito-Lay, went on to say: H.R. 8532 is a response to the judicial invitation extended in Frito-Lay.  The thrust of the bill is to overturn Frito-Lay by 
allowing State attorneys general to act as consumer advocates in the enforcement process, while at the same time avoiding 
the problems of manageability which some courts have found under Rule 23 [of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]. Id. at 8, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1976, p. 2578."
1151,2," Senate debate confirms that Section 4C was intended to affirmatively authorize state attorneys general to bring parens patriae 
damage actions.  It reveals that this authority was to become effective upon Section 4C's enactment and to remain so in each 
state until that state decided to revoke it under Section 4H. 22 Cong.Rec. 15853 (1976).  During the 1977 session of the Texas 
Legislature, H.B. 592 was introduced for this purpose but was not enacted into law.  See H.B. 592 65th Leg. (Texas 1977)."
1151,3," The nature of defendants' Tenth Amendment argument is of the type that courts have avoided until another day.  So we have 
done today, but it must be noted that Section 4C does not impose any duties on the Attorney General.  It merely provides that he 
may bring parens patriae actions.  Congress has revealed its respect for state sovereignty by giving the state the option to 
withdraw the attorney general's permissive authority. "
1153,4," The wording of the statutes of Maryland, Delaware, District of Columbia and Pennsylvania appears in the opinion."
1153,5," Texas cites Section 22 of Article IV of its Constitution and Article 4409 of its Civil Statutes as additional sources of authority.  
The Interpretive Commentary to Section 22 and cases construing the section establish that these two provisions confer broad 
responsibility to oversee private corporations to safeguard the public interest. The Attorney General argues that by bringing this 
action to prevent and deter alleged violations of the antitrust laws, he is acting precisely in conformity with Section 22 and Article 
4409.  We need not address this contention because of our holding that the instant action falls precisely within the grant of 
authority of Section 15.40. "
1154,1," Because the majority opinion turns solely upon the issue of the attorney general's parens patriae authority under Texas law, 
this dissent is directed solely to that issue.  As noted in note 3 of the opinion, however, several residual issues exist, the most 
important being that the Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 grants authority to a state attorney general to bring a parens patriae 
antitrust action ""unless the State provides by law for its nonapplicability in such state."" I have very serious doubts about 
Congress's constitutional authority to grant to a state's attorney general authority which the state has not seen to confer. Nor is 
this tenth amendment violation cured by the simple expedient of an ""opt-out"" clause.  At the very least, a state attorney general 
will have been granted powers by Congress beyond those granted by the state until the state has an opportunity to exercise its 
option.  The putative evanescence of an unconstitutional grant of power does not render it constitutional."
1154,2," In addition to section discussed in the majority opinion, the attorney general has relied upon Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. Art. 4409 
(Vernon 1976), which provides that the attorney general shall . . . inquire into charter rights of all private corporations and, in the name of the State take such legal action as may be 
proper and necessary to prevent any private corporation from exercising any power or collecting any species of taxes, tolls, 
freight or wharfage not authorized by law. Also, the attorney general refers us to Tex. Const. Art. IV § 22, which states that the attorney general ""shall represent the State 
in all suits and pleas in the Supreme Court of the State in which the State may be a party . . . and perform such other duties as 
may be required by law."" My reasons for concluding that section 15.40 does not contain parens patriae authority are equally applicable to these two 
provisions."
1154,3," This suit involves an allegation that the defendants, through the mechanism of selling vacuum cleaners door-to-door, violate 
antitrust law by ""imposing a system of resale price maintenance and unreasonable customer restrictions on their distributors 
and participating in group boycotts of retail vacuum cleaner stores."" Brief for Appellee at 1. "
1155,," The essential allegation in this case appears to be that, selling door-to-door, the defendants were able to avoid head-to-head 
competition with other vacuum cleaner retailers, avoid price advertising and maintain artificially high prices for their products."
1155,4," Indeed, in the State's brief, the attorney general takes the ingenuous position that, whether or not the Texas legislature 
contemplated parens patriae suits in enacting section 15.40, he possesses that authority because the statute confers authority to 
recover all damages recoverable under the federal antitrust laws, such as damages suffered by natural persons.  Brief for 
Appellee at 12-13.  This implicates the tenth amendment, of course, and as discussed supra note 1, neither the majority nor this 
dissent deals with that issue.  The significance of the rather glib concession by the appellee is that, as in the majority opinion, the 
desires of the Texas state legislature are deemed irrelevant. "
1156,5," In Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., 405 U.S. 251, 264, 92 S. Ct. 885, 892, 31 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1972), the Court held that, inasmuch as 
section 4 of the Clayton Act allowed recovery only for injury to ""business or property,"" suits for general economic harm had not 
been provided for by Congress.  Further, the Court held that to permit recovery for such harm would duplicate individually 
recoverable damages."

among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."
1171,3," As discussed in Section V(B) below, we also have serious reservations regarding CAT's proof of damages.  See infra text 
accompanying note 55."
1171,4," The term ""aggregate"" refers to sand, gravel, slag, crushed stone and like materials which are mixed with a cementing material 
to form concrete, cement, mortar, or asphalt.  Such materials are key ingredients in the construction industry. "
1172,5," Such a one-way haul is known as a ""deadhead over."" Obviously, the ""trucker's dream"" is a full load on both hauls. Record at 
1084-85."
1172,6," According to its president, Edward Baker, FRI is the largest producer of aggregate in the state of Florida.  Record at 1557."
1172,7," At trial, Hallowell estimated that sand which sold for $1.50 a ton in Orlando would bring $4.50 a ton in the Miami area.  
Conversely, rock selling for $3.00 in the Miami area would sell for $7.00 in the Orlando area."
1172,8," Included in this figure was a bank loan of $10,000. "
1173,9," Jerry DeGarmo, a former vice president for FRI, testified that regardless of the type of trailer used, the aggregate deposited 
would have to be picked up with a front-end loader and moved.  Further, the difference in cost between moving rock dropped by 
a rear dump trailer and moving rock dropped by a bottom dump trailer ""would be negligible."" Apparently, any preference for the 
use of rear dump trailers stems from the reduced likelihood of inadvertently mixing the stockpiles in the delivery yards.  See 
Record at 1023-30.  The mixing of stockpiles containing different sizes or grades of aggregate could have disastrous results for 
the concrete or asphalt produced.  Moreover, because concrete and asphalt producers are largely dependent upon public 
contracts, their products are subject to strict quality controls.  See also infra note 18."
1173,10," Eventually, Hallowell intended to station one cab permanently at each staging area to handle all off-Turnpike duties, including 
loading and unloading aggregate material.  This would free up at least one driver to handle only over-the-road hauling down the 
Florida Turnpike.  Maximum efficiency would be reached with the use of one over-the-road tractor running a continuous circuit 
between Orlando and West Palm Beach, and one shuttle tractor at each end of the turnpike servicing up to six hopper trailers. 
See Record at 1421-23."
1173,11," The cost of the first tractor was $50,000, the second $165,000. "
1174,12, Rinker owned two stone mines in the area: Rinker Lake Worth and FEC.
1174,13," The type of stone being carried from Rinker in Miami to Southern Paving outside of Orlando was known as "" three-eighths 
stone,"" and was customarily used for making asphalt."
1174,14," In its original complaint, CAT alleged that Southern Paving had been coerced by one of its Orlando stone suppliers, Florida 
Crushed Stone, into terminating CAT's delivery of stone from Rinker in Miami.  Subsequently, CAT stipulated to the granting of a 
summary judgment against it on its claim against Florida Crushed Stone. Record at 525."
1174,15, Whether Carlson actually agreed to such an arrangement was a matter of some dispute at trial.  See infra Section V(A).
1174,16," Invoices show that CAT shipped rock one day, missed the following week for unexplained reasons, then shipped four days for 
each of the following two weeks.  In all, CAT shipped approximately 850 tons of aggregate up until its termination. "
1175,17," The significance of the term ""allocation"" is discussed below at note 56.  Testimony at trial disclosed that FRI was Basic's major 
supplier of aggregate. After Basic stopped receiving Miami rock from Rinker, through CAT, its only purchases for at least three 
months were from FRI."
1175,18," Aggregate brought out of the Miami mines typically has a lighter specific gravity than aggregate found in the Brooksville-
Orlando area.  As a result, it is not perfectly interchangeable with the Brooksville rock. For this reason, the two types of 
aggregate could not be mixed in the same stockpile.  Although asphalt might be comprised of several different types of rock, 
including both types of aggregate, a special mix would be required.  Obviously, then, stockpiling different types of aggregate in 
the same yard would increase the likelihood of mixing those types, particularly if deliveries were made in a careless manner.  
The use of rear-dump loaders generally would minimize this risk.  See Record at 1023-25. Hopper trailers are most effective when the delivery facility utilizes ""hoppers"" for receiving the aggregate. The hopper consists 
essentially of a cone-shaped receptacle leading to a conveyer belt and covered by a grate.  The hopper trailer is driven over the 
grated surface and its bottom doors are opened to allow aggregate to fall into the receptacle, where it is carried by the conveyer 
belt to a storage facility.  If a particular customer used hoppers, there would be little chance of mixing different types of 
aggregate. Neither Southern Paving nor Basic used hoppers, however.  As a result, unloading aggregate from a hopper trailer 
could be a more complicated operation.  See Record at 1294."
1175,19," On the other hand, there was testimony that the customer would have to use a payloader to move the delivery piles into more 
condensed stockpiles regardless of whether delivery was made by a rear-dump trailer or a hopper trailer. See Record at 1319."
1175,20," According to FRI's sales representative, Walter McFall, the person who allegedly threatened Basic, when he asked Jake 
Scherf of Basic why CAT had been terminated, Scherf responded: Walter, it wouldn't work out.  They were scattering the material all over our stockpile area.  Each morning that I would come 
in, I would either have to get on the front end loader or one of my people would have to get on the front end loader and 
stockpile the material every morning.  And it just didn't work out to [sic] their behalf. Record at 1541.  Hallowell and two of his drivers, however, testified that they had never received any complaints about the way 
in which they had delivered aggregate. According to Ted Baker, president of FRI, Carlson told him that if McFall had said 
anything to him that appeared to be a threat of economic coercion, ""he would take that as a joke because he and Walter were 
very close friends."" Record at 1563.  According to Hallowell, Baker told him that ""Walter McFall threatened them out there, but, 
hell, he was only kidding."" Record at 1307. "
1176,21," For a brief period shortly before its demise, CAT resumed doing a more limited form of business with Southern Paving.  See

1176,22," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this court adopted as binding precedent all of the

457 U.S. 465, 102 S. Ct. 2540, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149 (1982), the Court did not rely directly on any of the various tests used by the 
courts of appeals.  It also expressed no opinion as to the relative utility of these tests.  In concluding that the plaintiff in that case "

1178,26," McFall testified as follows: Well, I went in to talk to Jake as I do periodically, and I asked Jake the question.  I said, ""Jake, is it true that Construction 
Aggregate is hauling materials into your operation?"" And Jake's answer was yes.  He said they have hauled a few loads of 
material in here.  And my next question to Jake is, ""Is the material working out for you?"" And Jake kind of nodded his head 
and said, ""Not too well."" I said, ""Jake,"" I said, ""You know our problems that we are having at Brooksville as far as the 
stockpiles of materials there.  And you and I have discussed many times in the past about keeping your stockpile of 
material up."" And Jake said, ""I know that."" ""The only thing I can suggest to you is if you use a load of material or three loads 
a day, I would certainly replenish that material each day so that stockpile would not go down."" I said, ""Because at the 
quarry at Brooksville, if your stockpile should go down and you should need a large quantity of material say in the 
neighborhood of 40, 50, 60 loads in a short period of time, in a day or two period of time,"" I said, ""Due to our stockpile 
conditions at Brooksville, I don't know whether we will be able to get you that large quantity of material or not."" Record at 1536-37."
1178,27," This is not a case like Associated Radio Service Co. v. Page Airways, Inc., 624 F.2d 1342 (5th Cir.1980), cert. denied, 450 
U.S. 1030, 101 S. Ct. 1740, 68 L. Ed. 2d 226 (1981), in which the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant was 
purely vertical in market terms.  In Page, a supplier of Grumman Avionics equipment sued an installer of that equipment for 
attempting to drive out another installer.  Thus, there was no direct competition between the plaintiff and the defendant.  The 
only market in which the defendant had an interest in restraining competition was the installation of avionics equipment.  
Therefore, it was most appropriate in Page to allow a direct competitor of the defendant to attempt to vindicate the interests 
which underlie antitrust enforcement.  624 F.2d at 1362-63; see Associated General Contractors of California, Inc. v. California 
State Council of Carpenters, supra,    U.S. at    -   , 103 S. Ct. at 910-11, 74 L. Ed. 2d at 740-41. "
1179,28," Recently, the Supreme Court further refined the standing analysis used in McCready.  In Associated General Contractors of 
California, Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, supra, a union alleged that members of a contractors' trade association 
coerced member and nonmember contractors and landowners to give some of their business to nonunion contracting firms, 
thereby injuring unionized firms, as well as the business activities of the unions.  In denying the union standing, the Court 
examined the following factors: (1) the causal connection between the alleged violation and the injury to the plaintiff; (2) the 
intent to cause harm to the plaintiff; (3) the nature of the injury, i.e., whether the plaintiff was either a consumer of the 
defendants' goods or a competitor of the defendants; and (4) the directness of the injury.  The Court concluded that the plaintiff 
union was neither a consumer nor a competitor of the defendants; in particular, the Court noted that ""the existence of more direct 
victims of the alleged conspiracy"" (unionized firms) should ensure adequate protection of the markets directly involved.  Finally, 
the Court found it significant that the type of harm allegedly suffered by the union was more clearly the concern of the labor laws.  
In our view, Associated General Contractors does not alter our conclusion. "
1180,29," As we have stated: HN11[
] any challenge to subject matter jurisdiction in a Sherman Act case is necessarily resolved by answering the following question: Can Congress prohibit the challenged conduct under the Commerce Clause?  If so, then the conduct is 
within the jurisdictional reach of the Sherman Act. Chatham Condominium Ass'ns v. Century Village, Inc., 597 F.2d at 1008."
1180,30," It is also well established that HN12[
] the existence or absence of an intent to affect interstate commerce is not dispositive 
when determining subject matter jurisdiction under the Sherman Act. See Hospital Building Co. v. Trustee of the Rex Hospital, 
425 U.S. at 744-45, 96 S. Ct. at 1852. Neither is it necessary to prove that the antitrust violation itself affected commerce. See 
Western Waste Serv. v. Universal Waste Control, 616 F.2d 1094, 1097 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 869, 101 S. Ct. 205, 66 
L. Ed. 2d 88 (1980). "
1181,31," In McLain, the Court referred generally to the local activities of the defendant.  Thus, McLain can be read as limiting our inquiry 
to the relationship between relevant local activities of the defendant and interstate commerce. See Western Waste Serv. v. 
Universal Waste Control, 616 F.2d at 1097 n. 2 (focus of inquiry is on defendant's business).  In our view, such an analysis is too 
restrictive, and is not supported by the case law.  First, McLain involved plaintiffs who were consumers rather than businesses.  
See also Chatham Condominium Ass'ns v. Century Village, Inc., 597 F.2d 1002, 1005-10 (5th Cir.1979); City of Fort Lauderdale 
v. East Coast Asphalt Corp., 329 F.2d 871, 872-73 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 900, 85 S. Ct. 187, 13 L. Ed. 2d 175 (1964); 
cf.  United States v. Employing Plasterers Ass'n, 347 U.S. 186, 189, 74 S. Ct. 452, 454, 98 L. Ed. 618 (1954) (criminal 
prosecution); United States v. Cargo Service Stations, Inc., 657 F.2d 676, 678 (5th Cir.1980) (same), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 
1017, 102 S. Ct. 1712, 72 L. Ed. 2d 135 (1982). In such cases there will be little alternative to concentrating on the defendant's 
activities. More importantly, however, the antitrust laws are concerned primarily with the integrity of interstate markets.  The starting place 
for analysis, therefore, is the relationship between the defendant's business and interstate markets, in particular the effect the 
defendant's business will have on those markets.  Most often this effect will be readily apparent because the defendant engages 
directly in interstate commerce, and any restrictive conduct has an immediate impact on the particular goods or services 
involved.  See Kypta v. McDonald's Corp., 671 F.2d 1282 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 857, 103 S. Ct. 127, 74 L. Ed. 2d 
109 (1982). Beginning the inquiry with an examination of the defendant's activities, however, does not mean that the plaintiff's 
relationship with interstate markets is irrelevant.  Occasionally the relationship between the defendant and interstate commerce 
becomes apparent only by examining the relationship between the defendant and other businesses.  Hypothetically, a business 
engaged in purely intrastate commerce could restrain trade in interstate commerce through its local conduct with regard to 
businesses that enjoy substantial ties to interstate commerce. Thus, when determining whether interstate commerce is affected 
by an alleged violation courts will often examine both the defendant's relationship with interstate markets and the plaintiff's.  
Such an approach makes good sense because injury to the plaintiff may result directly in injury to the market.  See, e.g., 
Hospital Building Co. v. Trustees of the Rex Hospital, 425 U.S. 738, 741, 96 S. Ct. 1848, 1850, 48 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1976) (local 
actions by defendants to block relocation of hospital adversely affects interstate commerce with regard to medicines and 
supplies purchased by hospital); Lehrman v. Gulf Oil Corp., 464 F.2d 26, 34-35 (5th Cir.) (demise of plaintiff's business had 
impact on interstate flow of goods he would have sold) (alternative holding), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1077, 93 S. Ct. 687, 34 L. 
Ed. 2d 665 (1972); Heille v. City of St. Paul, 671 F.2d 1134, 1137 (8th Cir.1982) (examining both plaintiff's and defendant's use 
of goods manufactured out-of -state); Turf Paradise, Inc. v. Arizona Downs, 670 F.2d 813, 819 (9th Cir.1980) (examining, inter 
alia, plaintiff's relationship with out-of -state corporations), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 1011, 102 S. Ct. 2308, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1308 
(1982). See generally, I E. Kintner, Federal Antitrust Law § 6.5, at 294 n. 41 (1980); I P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law 
para. 232, at 234 (1978) (necessary relationship between defendant and interstate commerce may ""consist in injuring plaintiffs 
who purchase supplies from interstate markets"").  In our view, therefore, the proper inquiry is one which focuses on the interstate 
markets involved in both the defendant's and the plaintiff's operations, and seeks to determine whether the defendant's business 
conduct will likely make its presence known in those markets."
1181,32," Moreover, the company which manufactured CAT's trailers was a division of an international corporation.  Record at 1046-47. "
1184,33," The movement of people has long been held to constitute commerce. Thus, businesses lying near interstate highways and 
serving interstate customers have the effect on commerce necessary to invoke jurisdiction under the Sherman Act. See United 
States v. Cargo Service Stations, 657 F.2d at 680, and cases cited therein.  Obviously, the movement of people interstate, as 
well as the movement of goods in commerce, depends upon the elimination of impediments to that movement.  Such 
impediments may consist of a scarcity of businesses serving interstate movement, e.g., gasoline stations and motels; see id.; 
they may also consist of conditions which physically restrict such travel in a more direct way, such as the absence or destruction 
of the means of travel. On the other hand, earlier Supreme Court cases determining whether Congress could regulate those engaged in the production 
of instrumentalities of commerce were concerned with statutes referring to those ""engaged in commerce"" or ""engaged in the 
production of goods for commerce."" See e.g., Alstate Construction Co. v. Durkin, 345 U.S 13, 73 S. Ct. 565, 97 L. Ed. 745 
(1952); Overstreet v. North Shore Corp., 318 U.S. 125, 63 S. Ct. 494, 87 L. Ed. 656 (1943); Pedersen v. Delaware, Lackawanna 
& West. R.R., 229 U.S. 146, 33 S. Ct. 648, 57 L. Ed. 1125 (1913). This suggests that technically the ""instrumentalities"" theory is 
the offspring of the older ""flow of commerce"" theory.  See Thornhill Pub. Co. v. General Tel. & Electronics, 594 F.2d 730, 737 
(9th Cir.1979) (treating ""instrumentalities"" theory as a type of ""in commerce test"")."
1184,34," It is worth noting that two well-known authorities have stated their reluctance to believe that the Supreme Court intended to 
narrow the scope of the Sherman Act, particularly in light of the Court's subsequent decision in Hospital Building Co. v. Trustees 
of the Rex Hospital, 425 U.S. 738, 96 S. Ct. 1848, 48 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1976). Indeed, they point out that rarely has the Court 
required anything more than a reasonable presumption that certain activities affect interstate commerce. See I P. Areeda & D. 
Turner, supra note 31, para. 232, at 237-41.  Moreover, Copp may represent no more than a deferential treatment of the district 
court's finding on that particular record of no substantial impact on interstate commerce. 419 U.S. at 202-03, 95 S. Ct. at 402. However, the only other court to address a Sherman Act instrumentalities claim since Copp has expressed reluctance to apply 
the instrumentality theory to find the necessary effect on commerce to support Sherman Act jurisdiction.  See Thornhill Pub. Co. 
v. General Tel. & Electronics, 594 F.2d at 737."
1184,35," The trial court instructed the jury in part as follows: There are four essential elements which the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence in order to establish its 
claim under the Sherman Act, that is this provision of the antitrust law as follows: First, that there was a combination or a 
conspiracy between the defendant, Florida Rock Industries, and the Basic Asphalt Company to put the plaintiff out of the 
business.  And that would be complied with if that occurred even though Basic Asphalt was nonwilling or a reluctant party to 
that particular agreement.  But unless the plaintiff proves that, it cannot recover.  Next, it must prove that such a 
combination or conspiracy constituted an unreasonable restraint on interstate commerce as hereafter defined."
1184,*," * * * The second element which plaintiff must prove to establish his claim is that the alleged threatened activity amounted to an 
unreasonable restraintive [sic] trade.  Not all restraints of trade are unreasonable.  All business agreements restrain trade in 
some way.  But only unreasonable restraints are illegal. "
1185,," In sum and substance, I would suggest that you consider these questions.  First, was the plaintiff, that is CAT, forced out of 
business because it lost the Basic Asphalt Company account?  Now, if your answer to this question is no, you would cease 
your deliberations and promptly give a verdict for the defendant. Now, if your answer to that question is yes, then did Basic Asphalt terminate the plaintiff because Florida Rock Industries 
threatened to cut off Basic Asphalt's allocation of aggregate unless it terminated the plaintiff? If your answer to this question 
is no, again you would cease your deliberations and return a verdict for the defendant. If your answer is yes, then did the fact that the plaintiff was forced out of business have a not insubstantial adverse affect 
upon interstate commerce by lessening competition or any other way?  Now, if your answer to this is no, then again you 
must cease your deliberations and return a verdict for the defendant. Record Excerpts at 26-36.  Later, the trial court was asked to repeat a portion of its charge: The Court: All right.  First was the plaintiff, Construction Aggregate Transport, Inc. -- is that the correct name? Mr. Schwartz: Yes sir. The Court: Forced out of business because it lost the Basic Asphalt Company Account?  Next, did Basic Asphalt terminate 
the plaintiff because Florida Rock Industries threatened to cut off Basic Asphalt's allocation of aggregate unless it 
terminated the plaintiff?  Now, if you answer either of those questions no, that would be the end of the case. Record Excerpts at 43.  The trial court's instructions could have been clearer regarding the particular analysis (per se or rule of 
reason) being applied.  Because the plaintiff did not introduce evidence of the relevant market, the case must be considered 
submitted under a per se theory.  Neither party has argued or assumed otherwise."

E. Kintner, supra note 31, §§ 8.2, 8.3, at 350-70. "
1186,37," These two terms are commonly used interchangeably.  See St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Barry, 438 U.S. 531, 540-45, 98 
S. Ct. 2923, 2929-31, 57 L. Ed. 2d 932 (1978); United States v. Realty Multi-List, Inc., 629 F.2d 1351, 1354 (5th Cir.1980); 
Bauer, Per Se Illegality of Concerted Refusals to Deal: A Rule Ripe for Reexamination, 79 Colum.L.Rev. 685 n. 5 (1979). "
1187,38," For a valuable critique of the relationship between these alternative analyses of concerted refusals to deal, see generally 
Bauer, supra note 37."
1187,39," Professor, now Judge, Bork has stated that: A restraint -- whether on price, territory, or any other item -- is vertical . . . when a firm operating at one level of an industry 
places restraints upon rivalry at another level for its own benefit. R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 288 (1978); see Bauer, supra note 37, at 692 & n. 45. If we examine the restraints alleged by CAT in terms of the underlying agreement (as we must given the plaintiff's allegation of 
conspiracy), then we see that the agreement is between entities occupying different levels -- rock supplier and purchaser of rock. 
Likewise, the agreement which FRI initiated, and in which Basic acquiesced, restrains competition at a level different from that 
occupied by FRI. The primary restraint is upon competition among transporters of aggregate. Although this may redound to the 
benefit of FRI's trucking subsidiary, the restraint was initiated by FRI.  Arguably, the restraint may endanger competition among 
purchasers of rock. This too however, constitutes a different level in the chain of production.  We see, then, that in this case the 
arrangement is almost purely vertical; the agreement is between, and the restraint acts upon, entities at different levels in the 
market.  In contrast, a horizontal arrangement involves agreement among entities operating at the same level.  Such an 
agreement generally will restrain competition at that level of the market.  Finally, on occasion entities on the same market level 
will seek to have an entity at a different level impose restrictions upon them.  Such putative vertical arrangements are in reality 
horizontal: the actual agreement is among competitors, and the effect is to restrain competition at their level, although the "
1188,," vehicle for the restraint occupies a different level.  See United States v. Topco Associates, 405 U.S. 596, 608-09, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 
1133-34, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972); Sports Center, Inc. v. Riddell, Inc., 673 F.2d 786, 791 n.4 (5th Cir. 1982)."
1188,40," As the Supreme Court made clear in the Sylvania case, a restraint on trade at a level different than that of the ""initiator"" of the 
agreement is often tolerated because it may lead to greater competition at that ""initiating"" level.  See infra note 48."
1188,41," Implicit in the argument is treatment of Tank Lines, not a party to this litigation, as a co-conspirator of Basic and FRI.  This 
assumption apparently stems from the relationship between Tank Lines and FRI.  There is no evidence that officials of Tank 
Lines were involved in or had knowledge of the alleged conspiracy."
1188,42," In Klor's, ten manufacturers conspired, at the behest of a competitor of Klor's, either not to sell goods to Klor's or to sell only at 
higher prices.  The Supreme Court focused generally on the possible injury to retailers in Klor's position. See 359 U.S. at 210-13, 
79 S. Ct. at 708-10. However, the Court also stressed that the agreement deprived ""manufacturers and distributors of their 
freedom to sell to Klor's at the same prices and conditions made available to [Klor's competitor]."" The Court also contrasted the 
case with one where a dealer agrees to an exclusive distributorship.  Id. at 212-13, 79 S. Ct. at 709-10. The necessary 
implication is that the feature which renders one agreement horizontal and the other vertical is the mutual agreement between 
entities on the same market level.  See Gough v. Rossmoor Corp., 585 F.2d 381, 387 n. 7 (9th Cir.1978). cert. denied, 440 U.S. 
936, 99 S. Ct. 1280, 59 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1979); McCormick, Group Boycotts -- Per Se or Not Per Se, That is the Question, 7 
Seton Hall L.Rev. 703, 760 (1976) (Klor's case is complex because it involved both horizontal and vertical restraints). "
1189,43," Thus, in Topco the putative vertical restraint was actually a mutual, and thus horizontal restraint among competing distributors 
regarding the allocation of territory.  405 U.S. at 608-10, 92 S. Ct. at 1133-34. For one court's analysis of a similar situation, see 
Sports Center, Inc. v. Riddell, Inc., supra note 39."
1189,44," One commentator has stated: The danger to the market begins with aggregates of units at the same level.  Any horizontal combination of sellers [which 
attempts to exclude a business from access to the market] . . . would seem to be per se illegal, regardless whether the 
coercive pressure is directed at the victim or the victim's customers; so long as two or more defendants are on the same 
level of distribution, it would not seem to make any difference whether the party denied access to the market by the 
combination's refusal to deal is (1) on a different level from one or more members of the combination, or (2) is or is not a 
competitor.  Woolley, Is a Boycott a Per Se Violation of the Antitrust Laws?  27 Rutgers L.Rev. 773, 793 (1974) (footnotes omitted).  
Professor Gerhart points out that ""attempts to synthesize the group boycott cases are legion."" Gerhart, The Supreme Court and 
Antitrust Analysis: The (Near) Triumph of the Chicago School, 1982 Sup.Ct.Rev. 319, 324 n. 16 (1983)."
1189,45," One example of a classic refusal to deal, a vertical restraint, involves a purchaser refusing to buy from a seller.  In the instant 
case, Basic is the purchaser of trucking services, and has refused to buy from CAT.  When the purchaser refuses to buy 
because he is obligated to purchase from another source, the arrangement becomes one of exclusive dealing.  The uniqueness 
of this case stems from the involvement of two products -- rock and transportation.  The potential significance of this aspect is 
discussed below. "
1190,46," In Abadir, the plaintiff, Abadir & Co., was an independent trader dealing in various chemicals, including urea -- an inorganic 
chemical compound used worldwide for fertilizer and other industrial uses.  The defendant, First Mississippi Corp., was engaged 
in the distribution and sale of urea.  The defendant agreed to sell a certain quantity of urea to the plaintiff, conditioned upon the 
plaintiff's agreement to resell urea for consumption only in Asia.  Subsequently, the defendant discovered that Abadir had resold 
the urea for consumption in the United States.  The defendant then terminated its contract with Abadir and sold directly to 
Abadir's American customer, effectively eliminating competition from Abadir.  In Abadir's antitrust action against First Mississippi, 
the plaintiff alleged that the contract between it and the defendant was an illegal horizontal market-dividing agreement, since 
First Mississippi engaged in the distribution of urea in competition with its distributors, such as Abadir.  A panel of the Former 
Fifth Circuit, however, held otherwise.  In doing so, the court recognized that the requirement of a horizontal aspect is not 
satisfied by the mere fact that the initiator of the restraint engages in some degree of competition on the plaintiff's market level.  
Rather, the court recognized that in essence the original agreement between Abadir and First Mississippi was simply a vertical 
agreement imposed by one merchant upon another occupying a different level in the market.  651 F.2d at 425. Thus, the court 
looked to the policies justifying the distinction between vertical and horizontal restraints, and tempered its analysis with those 
general considerations which militate against expansion of the per se categories: Departure from the rule of reason standard must be based upon demonstrable economic effect rather than -- as in [United 
States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U.S. 365, 87 S. Ct. 1856, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1249 (1967)] -- upon formalistic line drawing. . . 
.  It is only after considerable experience with certain business relationships that courts classify them as per se violations of 
the Sherman Act. . . .  The usual assumption is that a per se rule would grow out of a history of rule of reason cases all 
arriving at the same verdict. . . .  When the courts are uncertain of the competitive significance of a particular type of 
restraint they decline to apply the per se label. "
1190,651, F.2d at 428 (citations omitted). 
1191,47," In fact, McQuade has been cited as an example of an attempt to temper the harshness of the per se rule when there is a clear 
absence of anticompetitive effects, notwithstanding that the arrangement in question seems to constitute a classic boycott. See 
McCormick, supra note 42, at 744-46."
1191,48," The court in Sylvania announced that the primary concern of the antitrust laws is the protection of interbrand competition, 
occasionally at a cost to intrabrand competition.  433 U.S. at 58-59, 97 S. Ct. at 2561-62. We note that many unilateral refusals 
to deal or exclusive dealing situations necessarily involve an effect on interbrand competition.  The decision by a distributor to 
carry only a particular manufacturer's line of products, to the exclusion of another manufacturer's line, may reduce the ability of 
the excluded manufacturer to market his goods.  Nonetheless, this is not the type of negative impact on interbrand competition 
against which the Supreme Court's analysis in Sylvania was aimed.  Rather, the Court was concerned with those types of 
arrangements in which competitors agree among themselves to take certain courses of action.  The distinction rests on an 
economic assumption that when a manufacturer or supplier restricts his business vis-a-vis his customers or distributors he is 
attempting to compete more effectively against the manufacturers and suppliers of other brands.  The result will be vigorous 
interbrand or industry-wide competition.  See id. at 54-56, 97 S. Ct. at 2559-2560. On the other hand, the rule of per se illegality 
for horizontal agreements is based on another economic assumption -- that when business entities which operate at the same 
market level reach an agreement as to the conduct of their businesses, there is a strong likelihood that the net effect will be to 
restrict the output of products in an entire industry, thereby restraining interbrand competition.  Such restraints in turn thwart 
such goals as consumer welfare and the efficient allocation of resources: ""Horizontal"" agreements among competitors . . . threaten the achievement of antitrust goals by eliminating competition 
among the participants and thereby allowing them to enhance their collective profits to the detriment of consumers. P. Areeda, supra note 36, at 16."
1191,49," As the court in Com-Tel pointed out, the arrangement in Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 79 S. Ct. 
705, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741 (1959), was condemned even though there was only one conspirator on the boycotted level -- the 
numerosity requirement was satisfied at the boycotting level.  Conversely, in United States v. General Motors, 384 U.S. 127, 86 
S. Ct. 1321, 16 L. Ed. 2d 415 (1966), horizontal numerosity existed at the boycotted level, among the target's competing 
distributors, all of whom were parties to the boycotting agreement. In Blackburn v. Crum & Forster, 611 F.2d 102 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 447 U.S. 906, 100 S. Ct. 2989, 64 L. Ed. 2d 856 (1980), a 
panel of the former Fifth Circuit stated that the per se rule against concerted refusals to deal applies only when ""the plaintiff, the "
1192,," excluded party, is on the same competitive level with one member of the conspiracy. In other words, in such cases it may be 
proper to infer anticompetitive motive and effect because the conspiracy has a horizontal aspect."" Id. at 104. Because there was 
no evidence of agreement between the alleged conspirators in Blackburn, the foregoing statement was unnecessary to decide 
the case.  Further, the court's opinion that a horizontal restraint necessarily involves one conspirator on the plaintiff's level is 
doubtful, at best.  Of course, most concerted refusals to deal or boycotts will involve at least one conspirator on the target's level, 
since there generally will be at least one ""beneficiary"" at that level of the refusal by the boycotters to deal with the target. See, 
e.g., Radiant Burners v. Peoples Gas Light & Coke Co., 364 U.S. 656, 81 S. Ct. 365, 5 L. Ed. 2d 358 (1961); Klor's, Inc. v. 
Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 79 S. Ct. 705, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741 (1959); Fashion Originators' Guild of America v. FTC, 
312 U.S. 457, 61 S. Ct. 703, 85 L. Ed. 949 (1941). That this factor is not necessary in order to find a horizontal restraint, 
however, is implicit in many of the Supreme Court cases which resulted from prosecutions by the United States.  For example, in 
United States v. Sealy, Inc., 388 U.S. 350, 87 S. Ct. 1847, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1238 (1967), the Court struck down as per se illegal a 
scheme whereby competing manufacturers were licensed and allocated territories in which to sell bedding products under the 
Sealy name.  In determining whether the arrangement was vertical or horizontal, the Court focused on the relative market levels 
of the parties to the agreement, and not upon the particular level of the market which was being injured.  See also Timken Roller 
Bearing Co. v. United States, 341 U.S. 593, 595-96, 71 S. Ct. 971, 973, 95 L. Ed. 1199 (1951) (territorial restrictions among 
manufacturers); Hobart Brothers Co. v. Malcolm T. Gilliland, Inc., 471 F.2d 894, 899 (5th Cir.) (per se violation for competitors at 
same level of market to allocate territories), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 923, 93 S. Ct. 2736, 37 L. Ed. 2d 150 (1973); A.H. Cox & Co.

D.C. 81, 595 F.2d 888 (D.C.Cir.1979)."
1192,50," CAT's final argument is that the use of coercion in bringing about the agreement is a per se violation regardless of whether the 
agreement is vertical or horizontal. We reject this contention.  See Associated Radio Service Co. v. Page Airways, Inc., 624 F.2d 
1342 (5th Cir.1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1030, 101 S. Ct. 1740, 68 L. Ed. 2d 226 (1981); Northwest Power Products, Inc. v. 
Omark Industries, 576 F.2d 83 (5th Cir.1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1116, 99 S. Ct. 1021, 59 L. Ed. 2d 75 (1979); Oreck Corp. 
v. Whirlpool Corp., 579 F.2d 126 (2d Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 946, 99 S. Ct. 340, 58 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1978). ""The 
use of unfair means resulting in the substitution of one competitor for another without more does not violate the antitrust laws."" 
Manufacturing Research Corp. v. Greenlee Tool Co., 693 F.2d 1037, 1043 (11th Cir.1982)."
1192,51," To reiterate, those categories include horizontal and vertical price fixing agreements, division of markets between competitors, 
tying arrangements, and group boycotts. We have already eliminated the last category.  Additionally, there is no contention by 
CAT that FRI has engaged in any practices regarding prices."
1192,52," Actually, the tied product would be the agreement not to utilize CAT's services in the transportation of stone. See Northern 
Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. at 5-6, 78 S. Ct. at 518 (1958) (tying HN23[
] arrangement may be defined as an 
agreement by a party to sell one product but only on the condition that the buyer also purchases a different product, or at least 
agrees that he will not purchase that product from any other supplier). "
1193,," Thus, if Hallowell's version of FRI's ""threat"" is accurate, it does not constitute a classic tying arrangement: Basic was not 
required to purchase the tied product, aggregate transportation, from FRI, but was merely admonished not to purchase it from 
CAT.  The distinction potentially is of great significance.  In Kentucky Fried Chicken v. Diversified Packaging, 549 F.2d 368 (5th 
Cir.1977), a panel of the former Fifth Circuit stated that: HN24[
] When the victim of an alleged tie-in is not required to buy a single unit of the tied product from the tying party or 
from any source in which the tying party has an interest or on whose sales the tying party earns a commission, the 
arrangement simply does not constitute a tie.  Id. at 378-79. Thus, Kentucky Fried Chicken provides that to constitute a tie the arrangement must economically benefit the 
alleged perpetrator with regard to the tied product.  That case, however, involved franchise restrictions: The franchisee of the 
defendant franchisor was required to purchase certain products from either the franchisor or one of a group of suppliers 
approved by the franchisor.  The record demonstrated that no supplier who met the product specifications required by the 
franchisor had ever failed to gain approval.  Id. at 380. Further, there was no evidence that the franchisor had coerced the 
franchisee into purchasing its supplies. Franchising inevitably creates a tension between free competition and the need of the franchisor to maintain the quality and 
reputation of its trademark.  In such situations, as the court recognized, allowing franchisors to set quality requirements with 
regard to the purchase of certain products can actually enhance competition.  Id. at 379-80. These special concerns, however, 
may be limited to franchise disputes.  In the case before us, CAT clearly was foreclosed from doing business with Basic, 
compare id. at 378, and there appears to be no competition-enhancing justification for allowing FRI to restrict competition in the 
tied market.  Instead, this case directly implicates those concerns over barriers to entry which justify per se treatment for tying 
arrangements. Aside from the franchise problem, the facts of Northern Pacific are similar to those of Kentucky Fried Chicken.  In Northern 
Pacific, the Railroad sold and leased land on condition that goods produced on the land would be shipped over its lines, 
provided that its rates were equal to those of competing carriers.  356 U.S. at 3, 78 S. Ct. at 517. Thus, the case did not involve 
an ""absolute"" tie of the second product.  The Court's discussion of the cost loophole in this tie, however, suggests that every 
effort to use power in one market to influence competition in another should arouse Sherman Act concern.  See id. at 11-12, 78 
S. Ct. at 521 (even if tie subject to many exceptions, essential fact remains that agreements are binding obligations which deny 
defendant's competitors access to fenced-off market on same terms as defendant).  See generally, Note, Tie Out -- A Case for 
the Extension of Tying Theory, 35 Ohio S.L.J. 140 (1974). Finally, it is possible that although FRI did not expressly require Basic to secure shipping services from Tank Lines, the effect of 
the coercion was to ensure that Tank Lines would be CAT's substitute.  Even under Kentucky Fried Chicken such an effect 
would warrant per se treatment.  See id. at 377-78.  The record is ambiguous on this point; it is clear that Tank Lines did haul 
rock to Basic, but it is not certain that it was the exclusive transporter of Basic's rock during the critical period after CAT's 
termination. "
1194,53," Professors Kaysen and Turner have stated: A tie-in always operates to raise the barriers to entry in the market of the tied good to the level of those in the market for the 
tying good: the seller who would supply the one can do so only if he can also supply the other, since he must be able to 
displace the whole package which the tying seller offers.  Developing a substitute for the tying product may be very difficult, 
if not impossible.  Thus, tying tends to spread market power into markets where it would not otherwise exist: for example, 
few firms are prepared to supply machines like those of IBM, whereas many may be prepared to supply punch cards.  C. Kaysen and D. Turner, Antitrust Policy 157 (1959).  But See R. Bork, supra note 39, at 366-81.  Professor, now Judge, 
Posner has suggested that the real evil of tie-ins is that they enable a monopolist of the tying product to generate greater 
monopoly profits by engaging in price discrimination.  See R. Posner, Antitrust Law 171-84 (1976)."
1194,54," See Doran v. Petroleum Management Corp., 576 F.2d 91, 93 (5th Cir.1978) (parties free on remand to present by amendment 
new issues not inconsistent with appellate decision) (quoting Jones v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Co., 108 F.2d 123, 124 (5th 
Cir.1939)). See also GTE Sylvania, Inc. v. Continental T.V., Inc., 537 F.2d 980, 1004 n. 41 (9th Cir.1976) (en banc)

1195,5," See generally Williams v. Slade, 431 F.2d 605, 608-09 (5th Cir.1970). "
1196,56," There was some dispute at trial as to whether FRI's rock was ""on allocation."" Apparently, during the early 1970's FRI had 
attempted to cope with chronic shortages of rock by allocating a specific percentage to each of its customers. According to 
employees of FRI, this practice was abandoned shortly thereafter due to complaints by its customers. At trial, Hallowell and 
other CAT employees all claimed that during the time period here involved FRI was again allocating rock on some type of 
percentage basis among its customers. Employees of FRI denied this.  In our view, whether or not FRI was in fact pursuing such 
a course of conduct is a relatively minor issue.  All parties seem to have agreed that the demand for Orlando rock exceeded its 
current supply.  See also supra note 26 (statement by employee of FRI regarding ""stockpile conditions"")."
1196,57," Moreover, soon after CAT began hauling stone to Basic, Basic established an apparently open-ended line of credit with Rinker 
Miami."
1196,58," There was also evidence that at approximately the same time that CAT went out of business, Rinker opened up a rail spur 
from its Miami stone mines to its plant at City Point, fifty miles south of Orlando.  According to Dicks, this spur allowed Rinker 
itself to ship its Miami rock to City Point by train, and from there by truck into the Orlando market. At the time of trial, Rinker was 
shipping approximately 30 cars a day; it had the capacity to ship more.  It is not clear what relevance this evidence has to the "
1197,," case at hand.  There is no evidence to suggest that Rinker was doing any more than shipping its own rock from Miami to its own 
asphalt plants in the Orlando area; in other words, Rinker's ability to satisfy its own rock needs in the Orlando area does not 
necessarily bear upon the demand of producers such as Basic for Miami rock. Moreover, Dicks himself conceded that if CAT 
had been able to stay in business long enough to reach its anticipated goal of hauling 1,000 tons a day at a competitive price 
Rinker South Orange may have agreed to stay open on a 24-hour basis in order to continue doing business with CAT.  See 
Record at 1075-81."
1197,59," In H & B Equipment Co. v. International Harvester, 577 F.2d 239 (5th Cir.1978), a panel of the former Fifth Circuit stated that 
""isolated self-serving statements"" of the plaintiff's corporate officers are insufficient to establish antitrust causation.  In our view, 
H & B Equipment is distinguishable: There, statements by plaintiff's corporate officer provided the sole basis for an inference of 
causation.  Id. at 247. Nor did the plaintiff present any expert testimony as to its ability to penetrate the market and maintain a 
viable market position.  Id. In the case at bar, Hallowell's testimony was corroborated by a former officer of FRI.  Further, it is 
uncontroverted that each one-way haul by CAT which resulted from its inability to secure a 24-hour customer at the northern 
terminus resulted in a loss of revenue for that haul."
1197,60," The cases relied upon by FRI to demonstrate the absence of causation are readily distinguishable.  For example, Copper 
Liquor, Inc. v. Adolph Coors Co., 509 F.2d 758 (5th Cir.1975) (per curiam), denying petition for rehearing, 506 F.2d 934, involved 
a complaint by a beer retailer who operated at a substantial profit both before and after the alleged antitrust violation.  According 
to the plaintiff, his supply of Coors beer had been cut off because he failed to abide by the defendant's pricing and quality 
restrictions.  The plaintiff, however, used Coors only as a ""loss leader"" in order to draw customers into the store to purchase 
other goods.  The court rejected his claim of injury and damages because the plaintiff presented no itemized product-by-product 
records to show the impact on the sale of other products resulting from his loss of Coors beer.  Essentially, the only evidence 
introduced was the plaintiff's gross bank deposit records, which did not reflect product-by-product effects.  More importantly, 
however, although the plaintiff had available to him daily sales records which would have been extremely probative, he made no 
attempt to introduce these records.  The court concluded that when relative degrees of profitability are concerned, as opposed to "
1198,," the destruction of a going concern, there can be no evidentiary substitute for accurate sales and inventory records.  Clearly, 
Copper Liquor does not govern the case before this court. Similarly, in Shumate & Co. v. National Ass'n of Securities Dealers, Inc., 509 F.2d 147 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 868, 96 
S. Ct. 131, 46 L. Ed. 2d 97 (1975), plaintiff failed to produce any relevant data bearing upon injury and damages other than his 
own unsupported testimony.  See also Kestenbaum v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 514 F.2d 690 (5th Cir.1975) (no injury from price 
fixing scheme where plaintiff conceded he would have voluntarily taken action which defendant sought to coerce, and where 
plaintiff failed to introduce any evidence of reduction in sales), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 943, 96 S. Ct. 1412, 47 L. Ed. 2d 349 
(1976)."
1198,61," In particular, CAT's receipts demonstrate a clear decrease in revenues subsequent to its termination by Basic at the behest of 
FRI.  See Malcolm v. Marathon Oil Co., 642 F.2d at 858-60 & n. 24 (when plaintiff has offered sufficient evidence of fact of 
damage directed verdict on amount of damages is proper only in most unusual circumstances)."
1198,62, The trial court stated in part: 
1199,," The use of a projection of anticipated profits by an antitrust plaintiff in proving damages is entirely acceptable so long as the 
projection when reduced to present cash value leads to a reasonable estimate of the damages caused by the violation 
based upon the evidence. Now, you may elect to use any formula or theory that you consider reasonable for a reasonable estimate or an 
approximation provided that it is based upon the evidence in the case and the loss stated by the court. Now, in considering 
the elements of future profits and in determining what damages, if any, were sustained by the plaintiff, if it is entitled to 
recover, you are instructed that if because of the violation of the antitrust laws plaintiff was unable to earn that profit which it 
could have earned but for the violation of the antitrust laws, the plaintiff was, in fact, damaged . . . Now, the fact that a plaintiff's business may have been new or unestablished is not fatal to the amount of damages 
constituting that profit. Record at 1218."
1199,63," This two-page pro forma was a statement of expected income and expenditures with regard to the planned operation of the 
new business.  Record at 855.  During CAT's existence the figures contained in the pro forma were never updated, despite 
changes in the costs of various items such as fuel."
1199,64," The relevant growth rates were 10.48% for residential building, and 5.1% for road construction. Road hauling produced 57.7% 
of CAT's revenue, while sand hauling resulted in 43.3% of that revenue. Record at 863-66."
1199,65," Dr. Raffa testified that he used a ten-year period because Department of Labor statistics indicated that Hallowell could 
reasonably be expected to continue working for that period of time.  In addition, he relied upon Hallowell's own representations. "
1200,66," Thus, although the estimated cost for items in this category was $10,000, Dr. Berg's calculation of checks actually made 
payable to Hallowell as salary amounted to almost $22,000.  This did not include other items also included in this category, such 
as road expense ($6,500), car payments ($2,800), and miscellaneous expenses ($7,100)."
1200,67," For example, although according to CAT's disbursements for salary it had been withholding federal and state income taxes 
from its employees, it had never actually paid such taxes to the authorities.  Thus, CAT had incurred tax liability of over $35,000.  
In addition, CAT had incurred a liability of over $7,000 with the Florida Department of Transportation for payment of highway 
tolls."
1200,68," Implicit in the methodology used by both experts, the annualization of costs and revenues incurred during the normalized 
period of operation, was an effort to separate out recurring costs from start-up costs.  Calculations based on the pro forma would 
facilitate this task, since each category could readily be assigned the label of either recurring or start-up costs.  Dr. Berg testified 
that he encountered some difficulty in attempting to determine from the cancelled checks whether or not certain outlays 
belonged in one category or another.  Dr. Berg further testified that occasionally he was not able to determine whether a 
particular expenditure was made during the normalized period as opposed to either the start-up period or the slow-down period.  
A case in point would be the downpayment on the trailers which CAT purchased.  Because of manufacturing flaws in these 
trailers, which were returned several times to the manufacturer, CAT's deadline for the downpayment was delayed by several 
months.  If the actual payment was made during the normalized period, the expense nonetheless should be considered a part of 
start-up expenses, including this expenditure during the normalized period would tend to skew Dr. Berg's calculation of annual 
expenses.  On the other hand, since CAT intended to continue ordering sets of trailers at an increased rate, and not simply to 
operate on the first sets of trailers manufactured, it is possible that inclusion of this expense actually resulted in a more accurate 
calculation."
1200,69," In at least one category the pro forma clearly was inaccurate.  Hallowell had based his fuel costs per mile upon an estimate 
that diesel fuel would cost 55 cents a gallon.  Soon after CAT began operations, however, the price of fuel rose to approximately 
$1.  At one point during his testimony, Dr. Raffa indicated he relied on the original figure of 55 cents.  At another point, he 
seemed to suggest that he had updated the cost to 85 cents a gallon.  Even this estimate, however, falls far short of the mark. "
1201,70," The thrust of Hallowell's explanation appears to be that although revenue was calculated on the basis of using one set of 
trailers during the first few months of CAT's operation, the costs were calculated upon the basis of the ideal utilization of CAT's 
resources at a time when it would have between 10 and 20 trailers on the road.  Hallowell testified that maximum utilization 
would result when CAT would have sufficient equipment to run its tractors exclusively on the Florida Turnkpike between the 
Palm Beach exit and the Orlando exit.  At the same time, CAT would rely upon tractors stationed at these exits to actually 
conduct the shuttle operation of pulling each trailer to the various delivery and loading points.  Apparently, the mileage between 
Turnpike exits would be approximately 800 miles per round trip, excluding the shuttle operations.  Regardless of the viability of 
this plan, we agree with FRI that use of the two different mileage figures to calculate revenue per running mile results in a 
distortion of CAT's profit margin."
1201,71," FRI cites Copper Liquor, Inc. v. Adolph Coors Co., 506 F.2d 934 (5th Cir.), aff'd on rehearing, 509 F.2d 758 (5th Cir.1975) (per 
curiam), for the proposition that testimony as to lost future profits must be based upon the best available evidence. We would not 
go so far, however.  In Copper Liquor the plaintiff had established a long track record of profitability, and had available to it 
accurate sales and inventory records.  In such a situation, reliance on general operating statements and income tax records 
clearly is insufficient.  Copper Liquor does not control when, as here, the plaintiff enjoyed only a brief existence.  See Greene v. 
General Foods Corp., 517 F.2d 635, 665-66 & n. 23 (5th Cir.1975) (to support jury verdict expert's assumptions and 
methodology need not be most preferable ones), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 942, 96 S. Ct. 1409, 47 L. Ed. 2d 348 (1976)."
1201,72," We note, in passing, that CAT seems to have proceeded under the assumption that in order to prove lost future profits it must 
demonstrate that the business destroyed was operating at a profit.  Such is clearly not the law in this circuit.  See Terrell v. 
Household Goods Carriers' Bureau, 494 F.2d at 24 (plaintiff may proceed under lost profits theory even if business had never 
been profitable so long as each element of projection is supported by proven facts).  Accord, Murphy Tugboat Co. v. Crowley, 
658 F.2d 1256, 1260-63 (9th Cir.1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 1018, 102 S. Ct. 1713, 72 L. Ed. 2d 135 (1982). Thus, plaintiff's 
case for damages does not necessarily depend upon showing CAT's profit-making ability during the normalized period of 
operations.  When, however, the expert's opinion is based on the assumption that an entity was profitable, then the validity of the 
expert's ultimate opinion depends upon the accuracy of that assumption. "

Objection and Opposition at 12.  But plaintiff fails to advance any theory under which the Court could find such contracts to be 
illegal restraints of trade.  It does not suggest that the contracts with adjusters by themselves restrain trade, nor does it indicate 
that such agreements facilitate other types of illegal combinations.  The Court therefore concludes that plaintiff's allegations as to 
the illegality of the defendant's agreements with insurance adjusters are without merit. "
1215,3," The Court is nevertheless aware that the First Circuit has recently warned that Poller should not ""become a magic wand waved 
indiscriminantly by those opposing summary judgment motions in antitrust actions."" White v. The Hearst Corp., 669 F. 2d 14, 17 
(1st Cir. 1982), (quoting Mutual Fund Investors v. Putnam Management Co., 553 F. 2d 620, 624 (9th Cir. 1977)). "
1216,4," A threshold objection by defendant to this Court's jurisdiction can be disposed of without extended dicussion.  The defendant 
contends that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this case because plaintiff has failed to establish that the alleged 
restraint of trade affects interstate commerce.  See 15 U.S.C.  § 1 (prohibiting ""restraint of trade among the several States, or 
with foreign nations . . ."").  The defnednat concedes that many of the parts and supplies which plaintiff purchases in the course 
of its business come from outside of Rhode Island.  Defendant's Memorandum of Law at 24.  The defendant argues, however, 
that the effect of any alleged illegalities is merely to divert business from one body shop to another without affecting the total 
volume intrastate business or the total amount of parts and supplies purchased in interstate commerce.  However, if plaintiff is 
successful in showing that the provider agreements between Aetna and certain body shops are used to limit the quality of repair 
work performed, the requisite effect on interstate commerce could be shown.  This possibility that the defendant's practices as a 
matter of practical economics may affect interstate commerce is sufficient to satisfy the Sherman Act's jurisdictional requirement.

1217,5," The reasoning and analysis in Royal Drug were closely followed in the Supreme Court's most recent decision on McCarron-
Ferguson immunity.  See Union Labor Life Insurance Co. v. Pireno, 50 U.S.L.W. 4911, 4913 (U.S. June 29, 1982)."
1217,6," Participating pharmacies agreed to charge plan members only $2 for any prescription drug they dispensed.  The health 
insurance company reimbursed participating pharmacies for only the actual cost of all drugs dispensed to plan members.  The 
pharmacies in the plan thus received only a $2 markup on all drugs sold to plan members.  Royal Drug at 209."
1217,7," Plan members dealing with participating pharmacies had to pay only $2 for any prescription drug.  Members who dealt with 
nonparticipating pharmacies had to pay the full price charged by the pharmacy, and received reimbursement amounting to only 
75% of the difference between the price of the drug and $2.  Id. "
1218,8," In D & B Auto Body, Inc. v. Firemen's Fund Insurance Co., Civ. No. 79-0550, a case involving antitrust issues identical to those 
in the case at bar, the Court requested the participation of the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice as 
amicus Curiae.  In response to this invitation to this invitation, the Division submitted an excellent Memorandum of Law 
discussing the relevant issues.  D & B Auto Body subsequently was dismissed pursuant to a stipulation by the parties.  The 
Court nevertheless found the views of the Antitrust Division quite useful, and will cite them in this Opinion where appropriate.  In 
connection with the McCarron-Ferguson immunity issue discussed above, the Court notes that the Justice Department agrees 
that the vertical provider agreements at issue do not constitute ""the business of insurance"" within the meaning of the McCarran-
Ferguson Act.  Memorandum of the United States at 6-7. "
1220,9, See Plaintiff's Objection and Opposition at 3 and 11.
1220,10," Monopsony is the economic term used to describe a market involving one buyer and numerous sellers.  It is the counterpart in 
the buyer's market of monopoly."
1220,11," The vertical provider agreements might also have anticompetitive effects if they facilitated the creation of horizontal cartels 
between insurance companies or between automobile repair shops. Workman v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 
520 F. Supp. 610, 615-17 (N.D. Cal. 1981); Sausalito Pharmacy, Inc. v. Blue Shield of California, 1981-1 TRADE CASES at 
75,609; Quality Auto Body, Inc. v. Allstate Insurance Co., 1980-2 TRADE CASES at 76,696. Likewise, the agreements might 
violate the rule of reason if they were used by automobile repair shops as an instrument of predatory pricing.  Sausalito 
Pharmacy, Inc. v. Blue Shield of California, supra, at 75,609. There is no contention in this case that automobile repair shops 
have attempted to form a horizontal cartel or have engaged in predatory pricing.  Plaintiff's contentions with respect to the 
existence of horizontal agreements between insurance companies are discussed in greater detail infra. "
1221,12," The Justice Department takes the position that the vertical agreements in question do not violate the Sherman Act absent a 
showing that ""insurance companies have the power to limit the amount of repair work performed for policyholders, that they 
refuse to deal with any competent repair shop in the same terms available to other repair shops, or that there are other facts that 
would render their actions unreasonably anticompetitive."" Memorandum of the United States at 11."
1221,13," The Seventh Circuit in this case noted that: ""When the rate is too low, some repair shops resort to dishonest practices in order to survive.  These practices include: (1) 
charging for new parts but using old parts; (2) estimating parts that are not damaged; (3) straightening old parts but charging for 
new parts; (4) inflating labor hours; (5) billing for repairs which have not been performed; and (6) offering rebates and bribes to 
adjusters."" Quality Auto Body, Inc. v. Allstate Insurance Co., supra, 1204 n. 6. The court went on to observe that, ""Although these deplorable practices may be prevalent in the auto repair industry, in and of 
themselves they are not matters the antitrust laws were intended to address."" Id.  (emphasis in original).  This Court agrees with 
the Seventh Circuit that unethical business practices which do not have a significant adverse effect on competition do not violate 
the antitrust laws. George R. Whitten, Jr., Inc. v. Paddock Pool Builders, Inc., 508 F. 2d 547, 560-2 (1st Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 
421 U. S. 1004 (1975). However, if dishonest business practices are the result of a concerted effort to restrict output, a 
significant adverse effect on competition may result, and the Sherman Act's rule of reason may be violated. "
1222,14," Aetna comes very close to demonstrating that it does not attempt to restrict output by limiting the quality of repairs performed 
by its preferred shops. Aetna's affidavits state that it recommends shops based on their ability to perform quality repairs at a 
competitive price, and that it quarantees that workmanlike repairs can be performed for the amount of its estimate. Daffron 
Affidavit at 5; Mistretta Affidavit at 2.  This is circumstantial evidence that Aetna has not conspired with preferred repair shops to 
restrict output by performing inferior repairs. Absent an explicit denial that such an agreement exists, however, the Court cannot 
say that this is sufficient to meet Aetna's burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact. "
1223,15," Plaintiff appears to rely on the theory of conscious parallelism to prove the existance of a horizontal conspiracy. It claims that 
the defendant and other insurance companies employ similar practices in settling claims, such as the use of the same 
independent publication to determine repair times and new part prices.  Plaintiff suggests that the existence of these similiar 
practices can only be explained as the result of a conspiracy between insurance companies.  The Supreme Court has indicated 
that parallel behavior may be circumstantial evidence of the existence of an agreement or conspiracy. See Interstate Circuit, Inc. 
v. United States, 306 U.S. 208, 226-27 (1939). But it is also clear that mere proof of parallel behavior without more does not 
prove the existence of a contract, combination or conspiracy. Theatre Enterprises, Inc. v. Paramount Film Distributing Corp., 346 
U.S. 537, 541 (1954); Naumkeag Theatres Co. v. New England Theatres, Inc., 345 F. 2d 910, 911-12 (1st Cir., cert. denied, 382 
U.S. 906 (1965). In this case, plaintiff has failed to show that the similar practices employed by automobile insurance companies are anything 
more than the result of the companies' independent pursuit of their economic self-interest.  Absent such a showing, the doctrine 
of conscious parallelism in no way supports an inference of conspiracy. See Quality Auto Body, Inc. v. Allstate Insurance Co., 
660 F.2d 1195, 1200-01 (7th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 102 S. Ct. 1717 (1982); Workman v. State Farm Mutual Automobile 
Insurance Co., 520 F. Supp. 610, 621 (N.D. Cal. 1981); Sausalito Pharmacy, Inc. v. Blue Shield of California, 1981-1 TRADE

1223,16," The Court therefore need not dedcide whether an agreement between insurance companies to fix the price of automobile 
repairs would be immune under the McCarran-Ferguson Act."
1223,17," Such a claim would clearly be a challenge to ""the business of insurance"" within the meaning of the McCarran-Ferguson 
exemption. "
1224,18," Plaintiff appears to argue that even if the agreements between Aetna and its insureds are themselves immune under the 
McCarran-Ferguson Act, the anticompetitive effects of such agreements are not.  Objection and Opposition at 11-12.  This 
argument is completely without merit.  As the Justice Department points out, ""An antitrust exemption would be meaningless, 
however, if it were forfeited to the extent that the exempted conduct produced anticompetitive effects."" Memorandum of the 
United States at 14.  See Royal Drug at 249 (Brennan, J. dissenting).  If the agreements satisfy the requirements of the 
McCarran-Ferguson Act, they are exempt from the antitrust laws without regard to their possible anticompetitive effects."
1224,19," In addition, under the McCarren-Ferguson Act the antitrust laws remain applicable to acts of boycott, coercion and intimidation 
in the business of insurance. 15 U.S.C.  § 1013(b).  The Court concludes for the reasons set forth in a subsequent section of this 
opinion that the actions of defendant and its insureds cannot be said to constitute an act of boycott or coercion.  See pp. 30-34 
infra. "
1225,20," To trigger McCarran-Ferguson exemption, the system of state regulation need not completely duplicate the provisions of the 
federal antitrust laws. The Court agrees with the Second Circuit's observations that: ""The McCarran-Ferguson Act clearly contemplates that where a state undertakes to regulate the business of insurance, it has 
the power to permit practices which would otherwise violate federal antitrust laws; if the exemption is only to apply when state 
law squarely prohibits all acts which would, absent the exemption, violate the antitrust laws, the state regulation which the 
McCarran-Ferguson Act aims to foster, 15 U.S.C.  §§ 1011, 1012(a), would be a nullity."" Dexter v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc'y of the United States, 527 F. 2d 233, 236 (2d Cir. 1975); accord Travelers Ins. Co. v. 
Blue Cross of Western Pa., 481 F. 2d 80, 83 n. 10 (3rd Cir.); cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1093 (1973); Ohio AFL-CIO v. Insurance 
Rating Bd., 451 F. 2d 1178, 1181 (6th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 409 U. S. 917 (1972)."
1225,21," The Justice Department takes the position that a combination between insurers and insureds which aggregates buying power 
would not violate the antitrust laws in any case, absent some showing that insureds had agreed to pool their purchasing power 
and restrict demand so as to lower the price of automobile repairs below the competitive level.  Memorandum of the United 
States at 16.It seems at least unlikely that plaintiff could make such a showing at trial.  Because defendant is entitled to 
summary judgment on McCarran-Ferguson grounds, however, the Court need not decide if defendant has met its burden of 
showing that no genuine issue of fact exists as to this possible anticompetitive effect of the insurer-insured combination. "
1228,22," Defendant in its Memorandum of Law cites the deposition of Richard Ruggiero, the plaintiff's president, in support if its position 
that Fortin's statement was made without malice.  The Court has read the cited portion of the deposition and finds therein no 
discussion whatsoever of the question of malice. "
1233,1," Blue Cross relies on two cases from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to support its position that it is entitled to a summary 
judgment on the conspiracy issue.  Neither case is applicable since both determined that no conspiracy existed after a full review 
of the evidence presented at trial and the peculiar circumstances of the industries and relationships involved.  In Oreck Corp. v. 
Whirlpool Corp. 639 F.2d 75 (2d Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1083, 102 S. Ct. 639, 70 L. Ed. 2d 618 (1982), the court 
affirmed a directed verdict, and in Venture Technology, Inc. v. National Fuel Gas Co., 685 F.2d 41 (2d Cir. 1982), the court 
reversed a jury verdict. "
1235,2," It should be noted that it is plaintiffs' contention that Blue Cross' decision not to reimburse for physician-owned CAT scans was 
only one aspect of the overall illegal conduct. "
1250,*," The Honorable William C. Hanson, Senior District Judge for the Northern and Southern Districts of Iowa, sitting by designation."
1250,1," The district court's memorandum opinion sets out plaintiffs' basic allegations as follows: Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants conspired to: (a) fix the price to Plaintiffs of abstractor countersignatures on title 
insurance policies; (b) engage in frivolous and sham litigation by appealing the decision of the South Dakota Director of 
Insurance to grant a certificate of authority to Plaintiff First American Title Insurance Company to do business in South 
Dakota; (c) engage in frivolous and sham litigation by participating in the case of Fall River County Abstract Company v. 
Knutson, (6th Judicial Circuit Court, Hughes County, S.D., Nov. 6, 1979, Judge Robert A. Miller, presiding); (d) engage in 
efforts to influence the enactment of S.L. 1979, ch. 345, amending SDCL 58-25-16, which had the effect of requiring all title 
insurance policies issued in the state to contain the countersignature of an abstractor; (e) enforce and attempt to enforce 
SDCL 58-25-16; (f) attempt to establish a fee schedule for countersignatures to be provided by abstractors on title 
insurance policies; (g) enforce and attempt to enforce ARSD § 20:36:04:01; (h) engage in a publicity campaign directed 
against the Plaintiffs, ostensibly directed toward influencing government action, which campaign was a sham to cover an 
attempt to interfere with the business relationships of Plaintiffs. First American Title Co. v. South Dakota Land Title Association, 541 F. Supp. 1147, 1150 (D.S.D. 1982) (Bogue, Ch.J.). "
1251,2," HN1[
] Section 58-25-16 of the South Dakota Codified Laws provided: No foreign insurance company shall issue any policy of title insurance or certificate of title or other guarantee of title, 
covering any property located within the state of South Dakota, unless the same is countersigned by a person, partnership 
or corporation, who has met the requirements of §§ 36-13-8 and 36-13-10. Violation of this section is a Class 2 
misdemeanor. This statute was amended by the South Dakota legislature in 1979. See Part I B infra."
1251,3," HN3[
] The amended § 58-25-16 which became effective July 1, 1979, states: "
1252,," No insurance company shall issue any policy of title insurance or certificate of title or other guarantee of title, covering any 
property located within the state of South Dakota, unless the same is countersigned by a person, partnership or 
corporation, who has met the requirements of §§ 36-13-8 and 36-13-10 in the county in which the real property is located, 
or maintains an abstract plant in the county where the real property is located and meets the requirements of chapter 36-
13. A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor. The emphasized portion indicates language which was added by amendment in 1979."
1252,4," HN4[
] The legislature enacted SDCL § 36-13-26.1, which states, ""An abstractor's countersignature on a title insurance policy is verification that the abstracter has furnished the insurer a report based on the examination of record title and any other title 
information and services required by the insurer and § 36-13-25."" HN5[
] The legislature also amended SDCL § 36-13-25 to state in pertinent part that, ""[The Board of Examiners] shall also establish a schedule of fees and the requirements for an abstracter's services for countersigning title insurance policies pursuant 
to § 58-25-16."" The Board of Examiners subsequently promulgated regulations implementing these statutory changes. A title search -- meaning 
a search of both the abstracter's plant and the official county records -- is required before countersigning a title insurance policy. 
ARSD § 20:36:07:01.  Additionally, the search is to be ""made under the direction of an abstracter licensed in the county in which 
the property is located."" ARSD § 20:36:07:02. This regulation also requires the abstracter's full cooperation with the title insurer 
by forbidding any unnecessary delays in performing the search and countersigning the policy: ""Delays in the search or reporting 
shall be cause for complaint and disciplinary proceedings by the abstracters' board of examiners."" Id. "
1253,5," We shall refer to appellants collectively as ""First American"" throughout the remainder of this opinion. "
1254,6," This circuit recently refused to rely on the Duke & Co.  coconspirator exception, noting that it has been subject to criticism.

Pennington Doctrine, 45 U.Chi.L.Rev. 80, 115 (1977) (""in most cases the co-conspirator exception is unworkable and should not 
be recognized""). "
1256,7," SDCL § 58-6-8 requires the director of the Division of Insurance to hold a hearing in order to determine whether authority to 
engage in the INSURANCE BUSINESS SHOULD BE GRANTED. PART OF THIS INQUIRY IS A determination whether the 
grant of such authority would be in the public interest. Id."
1256,8," Apparently, the Association's asserted public interest concern (see note 7, supra) was that untrained individuals could issue 
title insurance policies without the necessity of being supervised or trained by abstracters licensed by the State of South Dakota. 
Brief of the Association at 6-7. This situation prevailed as long as SDCL § 58-25-16 required only foreign insurance companies 
to obtain the countersignature of a licensed abstracter before issuing a policy of title insurance. The Association asserted its 
position without success before the Division of Insurance and before a state court. It appealed the state court's decision to the 
South Dakota Supreme Court, but abandoned this appeal following the amendment of SDCL § 58-25-16 which deleted the word 
""foreign"" from the statute, thus extending the statute's requirements to domestic title insurance companies. "
1257,9," See Brief of First American at 41 (where First American claims that the abstract plant requirement makes it ""prohibitively 
expensive"" to construct an abstract plant and that the effect of the regulation is to give ""existing abstracters monopoly power 
over title services within their respective counties""). Apparently there was never any evidence offered at trial indicating exactly 
how costly it would be to assemble an abstract plant in accordance with ARSD § 20:36:04:01."
1257,10," The unauthorized conduct of the business of abstracting in South Dakota is a petty offense. SDCL § 36-13-9. The Board of 
Examiners is empowered to commence actions for injunctions against such unauthorized business as an alternative to the 
state's initiation of criminal proceedings. SDCL § 36-13-9.1. In addition, SDCL § 58-25-16 states that violation of its 
countersignature requirement ""is a Class 2 misdemeanor."" "
1258,11," Of course the state's exercise of its police powers in effecting economic regulations may impermissibly impinge on other 
federal interests which does not concern us in the instant case -- notably the interest in preventing significant burdens on 
interstate commerce which is protected by the Commerce Clause. See P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law paras. 219-20 
(1978)."
1258,12," See Community Communications Co. v. City of Boulder, 455 U.S. 40, 70 L. Ed. 2d 810, 102 S. Ct. 835 (1982); California

1258,13," Uncertainty exists regarding whether the second Midcal criterion -- the requirement of active state supervision -- applies to 
conduct by municipalities and other state subdivisions as well as to conduct by private parties. The Court expressly declined to 
address this issue in Community Communications Co. v. City of Boulder, 455 U.S. 40, 51 n.14, 70 L. Ed. 2d 810, 102 S. Ct. 835 
(1982) (""Because we conclude in the present case that Boulder's moratorium ordinance does not satisfy the 'clear articulation 
and affirmative expression' criterion, we do not reach the question whether that ordinance must or could satisfy the 'active state 
supervision' test focused upon in Midcal."") "
1259,," This circuit has answered this question in the negative in the context of municipal conduct.  Gold Cross Ambulance & Trans. v. 
City of Kansas City, 705 F.2d 1005, 1014 (8th Cir. 1983) (""The state supervision requirement is intended to control the potential 
for abuse created by authorizing private persons to make anticompetitive decisions and to insure that those decisions are 
consistent with the clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy at stake.""). The court's reasoning in Gold Cross 
was fourfold: municipal officials are generally politically accountable to their citizens, which keeps those officials in check; 
requiring state authorization for local government conduct is analogous to requiring active supervision of private conduct; it 
would make little sense to require the state to supervise and enforce municipal ordinances; and state supervision could lead to 
duplicative, wasteful regulation as well as the erosion of local autonomy.  Id., 705 F.2d at 1014-15. But see Ronwin v. State Bar 
of Arizona, 686 F.2d 692, 696 (9th Cir. 1981), cert. granted, 461 U.S. 926, 103 S. Ct. 2084, 77 L. Ed. 2d 296, 51 U.S.L.W. 3825 
(1983) (No. 82-1474) (The court held in the context of challenged action by the state supreme court-appointed committee which 
grades the Arizona bar examination that the acts of this governmental body had to be ""actively supervised by the state itself"" in 
order to be immune from Sherman Act scrutiny.)."
1259,14," The Court indicated that the conduct of a particular distiller under the statute would not necessarily be insulated from scrutiny 
under the Sherman Act, even though there was no basis ""for condemning the statute itself by force of the Sherman Act."" Rice v. 
Norman Williams Co., 458 U.S. 654; 73 L. Ed. 2d 1042, 1052, 102 S. Ct. 3294 (1983). "
1261,15," See also 1 Am.Jur.2d Abstracts of Title § 4 at 230 (1962) (""The inherent police power of the states permits reasonable 
regulation of businesses or professions when such regulation appears necessary for the general welfare of the people, and in 
the exercise of this power, a state may impose reasonable regulations upon those who seek to engage in the business of 
abstracting titles to real estate."") "
1262,16," It is thus unnecessary to consider the district court's alternative holding that the countersignature statute is exempt from 
antitrust scrutiny under the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1011-15, because the statute constitutes state regulation of 
the ""business of insurance."" See Union Labor Life Ins. Co. v. Pireno, 458 U.S. 119, 102 S. Ct. 3002, 73 L. Ed. 2d 647 (1982). Additionally, we reject First American's contention that the district court failed to consider its claims under § 2 of the Sherman 
Act. 15 U.S.C. § 2. If the alleged private price-fixing conspiracy was supposed to be evidence of monopolization, the claim failed 
for lack of proof. If the lobbying and litigation activity which has been held immune from anti-trust scrutiny under Noerr-
Pennington is alleged to be evidence of an attempt or a conspiracy to monopolize, then Noerr-Pennington applies to immunize 
defendants from these claims as well. "
1265,1," The briefs in this case, though of excellent quality, are a bit long, totaling 342 pages.  Counsel for both sides, who are frequent 
litigators in this court, should be aware of the passage of new local rules by the judges of this district on May 24, 1983.  One of 
the new rules, number 6.01, provides that except with permission of the court, principal briefs on motions may not exceed 30 
pages in length.  Reply briefs are limited to 15 pages.  The new rules will become effective on September 1, 1983. "
1266,2," For an interesting, and critical, review of Mr. Baxter's position, see the article written by David D. Stewart, an attorney in the 
Washington, D.C. firm of Miller, Cassidy, Larroca & Lewin.  Mr. Stewart's article appears in the July 18, 1983 issue of the 
National Law Journal."
1266,3," The articles were written by Judge Posner when he was a professor of law at the University of Chicago Law School.  Ironically, 
Mr. Baxter was also a professor of law (at Stanford) before he joined the Department of Justice in 1981. "
1267,4," It is certainly possible that someday in the future the defendants here will be in Chicago renewing their argument on this point 
before a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.  It is also possible that Judge Posner could be one of the 
members of the panel.  If he is, one could hardly blame the defendants if they smile. Judge Posner has been a member of the Court of Appeals since December of 1981. While I have found his judicial writings to be 
interesting and informative -- he is obviously very intelligent and his style is to be admired -- he has been criticized, most notably 
by a former brother from academia (Professor James F. Ponsoldt, University of Georgia Law School), for not remembering that 
he is no longer speaking as a law professor from the University of Chicago.  The criticism, written as a letter to the editor and 
published in the February 7, 1983 edition of the National Law Journal stated: ""Since President Reagan has demonstrated no reluctance to appoint law professors to the federal judiciary, it may be 
appropriate to take another look at the proper role of the Senate in reviewing and approving these most important "
1268,," presidential appointments.  In particular, the question arises: to what extent should a person's public expression of and 
commitment toward an idealogy hostile to prevailing law and public policy effectively preclude him from serving as a judge? ""Part of the job of a law professor is to criticize and seek change.  In fact, law professors often achieve prominence through 
their association with innovative reform and more radical schools of thought. Yet the role of a federal judge is institutionally 
different, if for no other reason than to engender respect for the rule of law -- distinguishing our governmental system from 
others -- among the public. ""Perhaps most startling among this group of professor-judges is Richard A. Posner, formerly a prolific University of Chicago 
law professor.  As one example, Judge Posner's recent opinion for the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Marrese v. 
American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 692 F.2d 1083, reported in your Dec. 13 issue, may demonstrate the 
continuing need for the Senate to insist upon closer substantive scrutiny of judicial appointees' intentions. ""Judge Posner's writing and consulting had long been known for its revisionist, anti-populist critique of the existing body of 
antitrust legislation and Supreme Court caselaw.  Judge Posner's antitrust casebook had set forth and criticized 50 years of 
Supreme Court antitrust boycott law as being too restrictive to business integration and not promoting economic efficiency. ""Perhaps, therefore, it should have come as no surprise that Judge Posner's opinion in Marrese relied on his own views 
and ignored at least six relevant landmark Supreme Court decisions, constituting the 50-year development of the law 
through the present day.  What is surprising, as evidenced by retired Justice Potter Stewart's outraged dissent in Marrese 
(Justice Stewart was sitting on the panel by designation), is that Judge Posner purported to revise the law and legislative 
history in a private antitrust case in which the merits of the antitrust claim had never been submitted to trial or even to 
pretrial discovery.  The case was an interlocutory appeal in which the appellate court admittedly lacked jurisdiction to reach 
the merits of the antitrust claim and in which Judge Posner did not even participate in oral argument. ""The Posner opinion in 
Marrese represents the imperial judiciary in its extreme.  The possibility of similar judicial nullification, based upon any 
ideology, should be addressed specifically by the Senate in its confirmation hearings, at least where the nominee is so 
publicly associated with an extralegal view of public policy."" "

1276,*," Additional difficulties may be mentioned for consideration if this ruling is reviewed on appeal.  It may still be arguable in this 
Circuit that a future profit claim based on a plaintiff's continuing employment life expectancy should not be made even for a 
wrongful antitrust termination.  Evidence of future profits is normally offered as one of the elements needed for capitalization into 
lost going concern value. Albrecht v. Herald Company, 452 F.2d 124, 128-29 (8th Cir. 1971). Unlike an employment termination 
case, a ""life annuity"" is not allowable as recovery for an antitrust violation, since ""the injury is to the business and not to the 
person."" 1.c. 131.  The ""life annuity"" method of calculating damages seems to have been allowed, however, in such later cases 
as Lehrman v. Gulf Oil Corp., 500 F.2d 659, 663-64 (5th Cir. 1974) and Arnott v. American Oil Co., 609 F.2d 873 (8th Cir. 1979), 
cert. den. 446 U.S. 918, 64 L. Ed. 2d 272, 100 S. Ct. 1852 (1980). Senior Judge Gibson's comment in Albrecht may, however, 
still have appeal to some members of the reviewing court. In the present case, moreover, plaintiff's business ""lifetime"" as a sole 
proprietor may be deemed to have ended when the corporation was formed.  The absence of a corporate claim for its losses as 
a possible future customer might thus serve to limit any recovery. "
1277,*," * Recognizing the monetary significance of this ruling, I note that it is necessarily interlocutory and that plaintiff will have a 
further opportunity, either orally or through further citations, to persuade me to change the views expressed above, which are, 
however, at this point firmly held.  Perhaps plaintiff will give up hope at this level and will reserve his contention for settlement 
value or appeal. "

1312,2," Calderone defined a ""target"" as a person or business against which competitive aim is taken. The line is clearly drawn by requiring that to have standing 
one must be an object of an antitrust conspiracy. Id. at 1296, note 2. "
1313,3," The Supreme Court prefaced its discussion in Data Processing with the following observation: HN9[
] Generalizations about standing to sue are largely worthless as such.  One generalization is, however, necessary 
and that is that the question of standing in the federal courts is to be considered in the framework of Article III which 
restricts judicial power to ""cases"" and ""controversies"".  As we recently stated in Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 101, 88 S. Ct. 
1942, 1953, 20 L. Ed. 2d 947 ""In terms of Article III limitations on federal court jurisdiction, the question of standing is 
related only to whether the dispute sought to be adjudicated will be presented in an adversary context and in a form 
historically viewed as capable of judicial resolution."""
1313,397," U.S. at 151-52, 90 S. Ct. at 829. Malamud reflected: "
1314,," The doctrine of standing poses the question whether a particular person is a proper party to litigate a given issue. 
Undoubtedly, the principal function of the doctrine is as a device to eliminate those plaintiffs who are jurisdictionally barred 
by Article III from maintaining a suit."

1315,5," The inquiry of whether an injury is ""too remote"" from an antitrust violation was analogized to an inquiry of proximate cause: In the absence of direct guidance from Congress, and faced with the claim that a particular injury is too remote from the alleged 
violation to warrant § 4 standing, the courts are thus forced to resort to an analysis no less elusive than that employed 
traditionally by courts at common law with respect to the matter of ""proximate cause"". McCready, supra, 457 U.S. at 477, 102 S. Ct. at 2548. "
1316,6," The Court conceded that ""HN16[
] it [is] virtually impossible to announce a black-letter rule that will dictate the result in every 
case"".  Id., 459 U.S. at 536, 103 S. Ct. at 908."
1316,7," Footnote 33 provides in full: Some courts have focused on the directness of the injury, e.g., Loeb v. Eastman Kodak Co., 183 F.704, 709 (CCA3 1910); 
Productive Inventions, Inc.  v. Trico Prods. Corp., 224 F.2d 678, 679 (CA2 1955), cert. denied, 350 U.S. 936, 76 S. Ct. 301,

372 U.S. 907, 83 S. Ct. 721, 9 L. Ed. 2d 717 (1963). Others have applied the requirement that the plaintiff must be in the 
""target area"" of the antitrust conspiracy, that is, the area of the economy which is endangered by a breakdown of 
competitive conditions in a particular industry. E.g., Pan-Islamic Trade Corp. v. Exxon Corp., 632 F.2d 539, 546-547 (CA5 
1980); Engine Specialties, Inc. v. Bombardier Ltd., 605 F.2d 1, 17-18 (CA1 1979); Calderone Enterprises Corp. v. United 
Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc., 454 F.2d 1292-1295 (CA2 1971). Another court of appeals has asked whether the injury is 
""arguably within the zone of interests protected by the antitrust laws."" Malamud v. Sinclair Oil Corp., 521 F.2d 1142, 1151-
1152 (CA6 1975). See generally Berger & Bernstein, supra n.31. As a number of commentators have observed, these labels may lead to contradictory and inconsistent results. See Berger 
& Bernstein, supra n.31, at 835, 843; Handler, The Shift From Substantive to Procedural Innovations in Antitrust Suits, 71 
Colum.L.Rev. 1, 27-31 (1971); Sherman, Antitrust Standing: From Loeb to  Malamud, 51 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 374, 407 (1976) (""it 
is simply not possible to fashion an across-the-board and easily applied standing rule which can serve as a tool of decision 
for every case""). In our view, courts should analyze each situation in light of the factors set forth in the text infra. This directive to the federal forum appears to conclusively resolve the inquiry left open in McCready wherein the Court 
acknowledged that the various aids to analysis implemented by the circuit courts were ""possibly conflicting"" but refused to 
""evaluate the relative utility of any of these possibly conflicting approaches toward the problem of remote antitrust injury."" 
McCready, supra, 457 U.S. at 477-78, 102 S. Ct. at 2547, note 12."
1316,8," Phrased differently, the antitrust court is to ascertain ""whether the law affords a remedy in specific circumstances"" or ""whether 
the [plaintiff] may recover for the injury it allegedly suffered"".  Associated General Contractors, supra, 459 U.S. at 535 and    , 
103 S. Ct. at 908 and 907."
1316,9," The case at bar does not require this Court to confront the issue of whether the factors enunciated in Associated General 
Contractors are exhaustive or merely illustrative. "
1317,10," Specifically, Malone is alleged to have monopolized the grocery industry in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. 
Monopoly power is the power to control prices or exclude competition.  U.S. v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 76 
S. Ct. 994, 100 L. Ed. 1264 (1956). Accord: Borden, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, 674 F.2d 498, 507 (6th Cir. 1982); 
Bataseed, Inc. v. U & I Inc., 681 F.2d 1203, 1231 (9th Cir. 1982); Dimmit Agri Industries, Inc. v. CPC International Inc., 679 F.2d 
516, 525 (5th Cir. 1982). Logic dictates, therefore, that the primary class of persons protected by § 2 are those adversely 
affected as a result of controlled prices or an exclusion of competition. In the case at bar Southaven has not adduced an injury 
resulting from either controlled prices of grocery products or exclusion of competitors or participants in the grocery industry. "
1318,11," The complaint states at Paragraph 6: Defendant's acts of unfair competition and monopolization have subverted Plaintiff's business and financial interests as well 
as the interests of the consuming public and other food suppliers and retailers. Similarly, Paragraph 8 provides: [Malone] desires to destroy the site as a present and future location for the retail sale of groceries and further desires to 
illegally dominate, control and monopolize the free competition in the area by damaging Plaintiff, the consuming public and 
other business in the trade area."
1318,12," Further, should Southaven possess a § 4 remedy against Malone predicated upon diminished lease revenue resulting from 
less consumer activity at a shopping area without a grocery enterprise, then it follows axiomatically that Southaven's non-grocery 
lessees would possess a similar cause of action predicated upon diminished sales resulting from less consumer activity. Not 
only would the potential damage claims of these absent plaintiffs be highly speculative, but apportionment of damages among "
1319,," the lessees, and Southaven, would require complex calculations joining, at best, conceptual difficulties. See: Associated General 
Contractors, supra, 459 U.S. at 545, 103 S. Ct. at 912 (""the District Court would face problems of identifying damages and 
apportioning them""). "

except for services rendered in connection with the sale or purchase of goods, wares, or merchandise, either to the other 
party to such transaction or to an agent, representative, or other intermediary therein where such intermediary is acting in 
fact for or in behalf, or is subject to the direct or indirect control, of any party to such transaction other than the person by

1331,1," The plaintiff invoked the district court's jurisdiction over the federal antitrust claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1337 and over the 
state antitrust claims under the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction."
1331,2," Certain of the defendants filed a cross-appeal, contesting the district court's preliminary determination that the activities 
complained of satisfied the Sherman Act's interstate commerce requirement. At oral argument this challenge was abandoned 
and the defendants conceded that their activities had a substantial effect on interstate commerce."
1331,3," The federal government had numerous financial assistance programs designed to encourage states and local governments to 
develop comprehensive plans for solid waste disposal. One example was the Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965. See 42 U.S.C. 
§§ 6901-6987."
1331,4," Significantly, in May 1970, aware of the critical problem in solid waste disposal, the Iowa legislature enacted sections 455B.75-
.83 for the purpose of encouraging municipalities to ""provide sanitary disposal projects for the final disposition of solid wastes by 
their residents and, thereby, protect the citizens of this state from such hazards to their health, safety, and welfare that result 
from the uncontrolled disposal of solid wastes."" See 1970 Iowa Legis. Serv. at 336 § 1. This statute required that municipalities 
establish and maintain solid waste disposal systems, and, like Chapter 28E, provided for cooperative arrangements between 
governmental units. "
1332,5," The Supreme Court of Iowa ruled that the delegation of legislative power to the municipalities and Metro under chapters 28E 
and 28F of the Iowa Code was proper under the Iowa constitution.  Goreham v. Des Moines Metropolitan Area Solid Waste 
Agency, 179 N.W.2d 449 (Iowa 1970)."
1332,6," Under Section 401 of the Service Contract, each of the Municipalities agreed to adopt an ordinance prior to the execution of the 
Service Contract authorizing the levying and collection of rates, charges, tolls, and other fees for the services and facilities of the 
Metro project.  Each municipality adopted such a rate ordinance."
1332,7," Section 701 provided in pertinent part: Non-Competitive Facilities. So long as any Bonds of the Agency are outstanding, the Municipality shall not grant any 
franchise or license to any person, firm, association or corporation for a competing solid waste disposal system, nor shall 
they permit any municipal solid waste disposal system to compete with the Agency. . . . The Agency however shall have the right to establish, construct and acquire any other disposal project, provided, however, 
that no such other disposal project shall be so established, constructed or acquired unless the Consulting Engineers shall 
certify that such other disposal project will not be competitive with said Project constructed and acquired pursuant to the 
terms of the Resolution, and will not materially or adversely affect the revenues to be derived from said Project, or the rights 
and security of the holders of the Bonds issued pursuant to said Resolution."
1332,8," In addition, the municipalities were apprehensive that, unless future revenues could be assured, the municipalities themselves 
might become liable for any default by Metro in paying the bondholders. This would violate section 28F.6 of the Iowa Code, 
which required the cooperative project to be self-supporting. "
1333,9," In its brief to the district court, plaintiff explained: CIRS does not challenge the establishment of the Metro facility. It does not dispute the municipalities' powers to regulate 
the disposal of refuse and garbage, either pursuant to the municipal police power to promote and preserve the welfare and 
convenience of the people (citation) or pursuant to statutory mandate (citation). It does not challenge the municipalities 
ability to jointly exercise their powers to provide for joint facilities, including sanitary disposal projects. What CIRS does challenge here is the defendants' method of insuring the economic success of its project by destroying 
competition; i.e., requiring that, as long as the bonds are outstanding, all solid waste generated from within the Metro area 
be deposited at the Metro site, and the enforcement of that anti-competitive activity by way of permits and criminal 
ordinances. Such conduct obviously cannot be justified as a proper exercise of the Defendants police power since the 
requirement is not tied to a health or welfare concern but rather to a financial one. "
1334,10," In a concurring opinion, Chief Justice Burger developed the theory that municipal conduct should be subject to antitrust 
strictures if it was ""proprietary"" in nature but not if it was ""governmental"" in nature. See 435 U.S. at 418."
1334,11," State authorization can perhaps be inferred from concurrent state acts evincing a policy favoring regulation or from a 
delegation of authority to a municipality to act in an area which has customarily been regulated in an anticompetitive manner. 
See Note, The Application of Antitrust Laws to Municipal Activities, 79 Colum. L. Rev. 518, 523 (1979). "
1335,12," These sections, however, do not require that the cities and counties actually establish and operate such facilities themselves. 
The municipalities could have complied with their statutory obligation by contracting with private parties."
1335,13," The statute also provides for administrative supervision and regulation of disposal facilities by the Iowa Environmental Quality 
Commission. "
1337,14," Plaintiff also points out that the constituent municipalities in Metro could guarantee the financial stability of the agency by 
assessing a fee on all property owners in the area. This would eliminate the need for any monopoly of the disposal of solid 
waste, and would be permissible, since the activities of Metro involve the public health and welfare."
1337,15," Indeed, this conclusion is strengthened by the Iowa Supreme Court's interpretation that Chapters 28E and 28F authorize the 
issuance of revenue bonds and the use of restrictions on competition to protect the liquidity and merchantability of the bonds. 
See Goreham v. Des Moines Metro Area Solid Waste Agency, supra, 179 N.W.2d at 457-58. "
1338,16," In view of the district court's dismissal of the federal antitrust claims, dismissal of the pendent state antitrust claims was 
warranted."
1338,17," Relying upon National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833, 49 L. Ed. 2d 245, 96 S. Ct. 2465 (1976), and Hodel v. Virginia 
Surface Mining & Reclamation Ass'n, 452 U.S. 264, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1, 101 S. Ct. 2352 (1981), the defendants have also argued 
that, even apart from the Parker exemption, their activities are protected from antitrust scrutiny by the tenth amendment to the 
United States Constitution. Because we hold that the Parker exemption applies, there is no need for us to consider the 
defendants' constitutional argument. It should be noted, however, that once the revenue bonds have been retired, the legislative 
justification for the anticompetitive provisions will disappear. If the ordinances are still in effect and plaintiff chooses to challenge 
them at that time, the Parker exemption might no longer be available to Metro. "

from a rental property into a condominium; (2) the three Invsco defendants, two of which succeeded the developer defendants 
as the title holders of the unsold residential units and one of which is the assignee of a contract to manage the condominium;

Stat. ch. 30, §§ 304, 306. The Illinois Condominium Property Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 30, §§ 301-31, has been amended several 
times since the declaration of condominium ownership and the contracting for management services in 1973. None of the 
changes affect the issue before us. We note, however, that an amendment to Ill.  Rev. Stat. ch. 30, § 318.2, effective January 1, 
1978, if applicable, would have provided an opportunity to cancel the contract in question or any developer negotiated contract 
which attempted to bind the unit owners' association for a period of more than two years from the recording of the declaration.

1350,2," The draft is a selection system whereby the respective NFL teams are awarded the initial rights to negotiate exclusively with 
football players graduating from college. The option clause is a provision of the NFL Standard Player Contract which grants the team the right to renew a player's contract 
for one additional year if the team and player cannot agree to a new contract.  After the option year expires, the player becomes 
a ""free agent"" and may negotiate and contract with teams of another league or with other NFL teams subject to the Rozelle rule. The Rozelle rule is named after the NFL commissioner, Pete Rozelle.  This rule provides if a free agent contracts with another 
NFL team, the new team must compensate the player's former team with draft choice(s) or other player contracts.  If the new 
and former teams cannot agree as to the compensation, the commissioner arbitrates the matter and determines the 
compensation. The tampering rule prohibits an NFL team from negotiating with a player currently under contract with another NFL team. Also, if 
one team has the exclusive right to negotiate with a player, no other team may tamper with that player. The one-man rule refers to the commissioner's authority to compel a player to adhere to terms of an operative collective 
bargaining agreement between the players and the NFL teams."
1350,3," This second collective bargaining agreement was negotiated during the pendency of antitrust suits brought by players against 
the NFL.  The most significant case, Alexander v. National Football League (D.Minn. 1977) 1977-2 Trade Cases (CCH) para. 
61,730, was a class action.  The agreement and Alexander incorporate a settlement which includes the practices and rules 
Partee challenges.  The settlement also contains a covenant not to sue (in antitrust) by the class members.  However, Partee, 
who filed this suit before the specified cutoff date, chose not to be a class member.  This agreement terminated in mid-1982. "
1351,4," As considered by the trial court in Flood v. Kuhn, baseball's reserve system had many of the attributes of the NFL rules and 
practices of which Partee complains.  Baseball's reserve system involved an agreement by all of the teams to be involved in a 
draft creating exclusive bargaining rights in the club as to the draftee; a uniform player's contract empowering the signing club 
unilaterally to renew a player's contract from year to year; denial of any right in a player, once signed, to negotiate with any other 
team; a prescribed number of players per team; and the unilateral right of a team to assign the contract to another team. (See 
Flood v. Kuhn, supra, 316 F.Supp. 271, 273-275.) "

would necessarily have to exempt all businesses engaged in multistate activities."" (Dis. opn. at pp. 389, 408.) This opinion has a 
limited scope.  The Cartwright Act remains vital.  We do not mean to suggest that multistate activities of other businesses may 
not be subject to state regulation upon due consideration of the commerce clause. Our holding is limited to the issue directly 
before us, the inapplicability of the Cartwright Act to professional football. "
1353,1," (U.S. Const., art. VI, cl. 2.)"
1353,2," ""The Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate Commerce . . . among the several States . . . ."" (U.S. Const., art. I, § 8, cl. 3.) 
The Supreme Court has explained: ""The Commerce Clause reaches, in the main, three categories of problems.  First, the use of 
channels of interstate or foreign commerce which Congress deems are being misused, as, for example, the shipment of stolen 
goods . . . or of persons who have been kidnapped . . . .  Second, protection of the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, as, 
for example, the destruction of an aircraft . . . or persons or things in commerce, as, for example, thefts from interstate shipments 
. . . .  Third, those activities affecting commerce."" ( Perez v. United States (1971) 402 U.S. 146, 150 [28 L.Ed.2d 686, 690, 91 
S.Ct. 1357].) We are here concerned with the third element of interstate commerce jurisdiction. "
1354,3," ""Consequently, it would be difficult to prove that a policy which removes privately instituted interferences, delays, interruptions, 
and inconveniences with interstate commerce, is itself a delay, interference, interruption, and inconvenience to interstate 
commerce when enforced at the local level by the States."" (Flynn, Federalism and State Antitrust Regulation (1964) at p. 84.) "
1356,4," Pursuant to federal rules of procedure for class actions, a notice was sent to all class members, including Partee, concerning 
the potential settlement. The settlement notice contained the following statement: ""Neither the covenant not to sue, nor the 
dismissal with prejudice of this action shall prevent any member of the plaintiff class who duly commenced an individual action . . 
. in any Federal or State Court, prior to March 4, 1977, from pursuing such action to its lawful conclusion through trial and 
appeal."" (Italics added.)"
1356,5, The court found in favor of the Chargers on fraud and unpaid wages causes of action.
1356,6," The traditional preemption doctrine focuses on congressional intent.  Thus, state regulation is preempted if Congress 
expresses a clear intent to reserve a field exclusively within its jurisdiction (see, e.g., Pennsylvania v. Nelson (1956) 350 U.S. 
497 [100 L.Ed. 640, 76 S.Ct. 477]; Charleston & W.C. Railway v. Varnville Furniture Co. (1915) 237 U.S. 597 [59 L.Ed. 1137, 35 
S.Ct. 715]) or if such an intent can be inferred in a field dominated by pervasive federal regulation (see, e.g., Garner v. 
Teamsters Union (1953) 346 U.S. 485 [98 L.Ed. 228, 74 S.Ct. 161]; Hines v. Davidowitz, supra, 312 U.S. 52). Conversely, in the 
absence of congressional occupation of a field, a state may regulate the interstate aspects of an activity, even though the 
regulation has some effect on interstate commerce. (See, e.g., Head v. New Mexico Board (1936) 374 U.S. 424 [10 L.Ed.2d 
983, 83 S.Ct. 1759]; Huron Cement Co. v. Detroit (1960) 362 U.S. 440 [4 L.Ed.2d 852, 80 S.Ct. 813, 78 A.L.R.2d 1294].) 
However, even in this latter area, state laws which conflict with federal law may be preempted. (E.g., California v. Zook (1949) 
336 U.S. 725 [93 L.Ed. 1005, 69 S.Ct. 841]; but see Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland (1978) 437 U.S. 117 [57 L.Ed.2d 91, 
98 S.Ct. 2207]; Parker v. Brown (1943) 317 U.S. 341 [87 L.Ed. 315, 63 S.Ct. 307].) "
1357,7," ""The history of the Sherman Antitrust Act makes it clear that the Congress did not intend that the federal legislation preempt 
parallel state efforts to control unfair competitive practices.  Before the enactment of the Sherman Act, some 21 states had 
legislation proscribing 'combinations in restraint of trade.' Thus, it was not by accident that Congress did not use language in its 
act that would expressly preclude state regulation though the activity possessed interstate qualities.  Senator Sherman, in urging 
enactment of his bill, stated: 'This bill . . . has for its . . . object to invoke the aid of the courts of the United States to deal with the 
combinations . . . when they affect injuriously our foreign and interstate commerce . . . and in this way to supplement the 
enforcement of the established rules of the common and statute laws by the several states in dealing with combinations that 
affect injuriously the industrial liberty of the citizens of those states.  It is to arm the federal courts within the limit of their 
constitutional power that they may cooperate with the state courts in checking, curbing and controlling the most dangerous 
combinations that now threaten the business, property, and trade of the people of the United States . . . .' (21 Cong. Rec. 2457 
(1890).)"" ( R. E. Spriggs Co. v. Coors, supra, 37 Cal.App.3d at p. 660, original italics, fn. omitted.) Thus, the fact that federal 
antitrust enforcement has historically become the dominant force in the field does not in itself mean that state antitrust law is 
displaced or preempted by the Sherman Act which, as noted, was passed for the purpose of supplementing state antitrust 
enforcement by providing for more efficient regulation of anticompetitive interstate activities."
1357,8," Also relevant in this regard is the shared common law heritage of state and federal antitrust laws. (See Flynn, Federalism and 
State Antitrust Regulation, supra, at p. 90.) As this court stated in Speegle v. Board of Fire Underwriters (1946) 29 Cal.2d 34, 44 
[172 P.2d 867]: ""The Cartwright Act merely articulates in greater detail a public policy against restraint of trade that has long 
been recognized at common law . . . ."" This policy is wholly in conformity with the purposes sought to be furthered by the 
Sherman Act. (See, e.g., Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States (1958) 356 U.S. 1 [2 L.Ed.2d 545, 78 S.Ct. 514]; Apex Hosiery 
Co. v. Leader (1940) 310 U.S. 469 [84 L.Ed. 1311, 60 S.Ct. 982, 128 A.L.R. 1044].)"
1357,9," Although some courts have employed supremacy clause preemption and commerce clause preclusion terminology 
interchangeably, it is apparent that preclusion has been treated as a species of preemption. "
1358,10," Conversely, the reach of federal antitrust jurisdiction into intrastate activity, while generally expansive, is also limited by the 
requirement that the impact of the local conduct on interstate commerce be more than incidental.  (See, e.g., Sun Valley 
Disposal Co. v. Silver State Disposal Co. (9th Cir. 1969) 420 F.2d 341 [garbage collection]; Kallen v. Nexus Corp. (N.D.Ill. 1973) 
353 F.Supp. 33 [bar review courses].) The boundaries in this area, however, are elusive.  The courts have disagreed as to what 
type of activities are ""essentially local"" and thus not subject to federal intervention.  (Compare United States v. Yellow Cab Co. 
(1947) 332 U.S. 218, 230 [91 L.Ed. 2010, 2020, 67 S.Ct. 1560] with Times-Picayne v. United States (1953) 345 U.S. 594, 602, 
fn. 11 [97 L.Ed. 1277, 1286, 73 S.Ct. 872].)"
1358,11," In Allied Chemical, supra, 101 N.W.2d 133, three out-of-state corporate defendants were charged with a price-fixing 
conspiracy under the Wisconsin antitrust law. Defendants had neither offices nor employees in the state; and prices were set 
nationwide. Nonetheless, the court found them within the purview of the Wisconsin law. "
1359,12," As previously noted, some cases do appear to discuss preclusion and preemption interchangeably.  One example is Alfred M. 
Lewis, Inc. v. Warehousemen etc. Local No. 542, supra, 163 Cal.App.2d 771, which involved an agreement to restrict 
competition.  The trial court had determined that the agreement ""would have been in violation of the Cartwright Act if it involved 
'local businesses not engaged in interstate commerce,' but that because appellant [Lewis] was engaged in interstate commerce, 
the laws of the United States apply."" ( Id., at p. 783.) Lewis was ""engaged in interstate business, operating grocery stores in 
many states."" ( Id., at p. 775.) Thus, the issue of commerce clause preclusion was squarely raised.  The Court of Appeal 
reversed, holding that the Sherman Act does not preempt the Cartwright Act since there is no conflict between the acts.  The 
court also discussed commerce clause preclusion: it stated that, even assuming ""that the activities in question are within the 
sphere of the commerce clause [,] . . . [the] fact that Congress has acted to prevent restraints on trade in commerce, of itself, 
does not invalidate legislation by a state effecting the subtantially same result."" ( Id., at p. 788.) "
1360,13," McHugh, the Massachusetts case cited by the Court of Appeal, makes the following pertinent observations in arguing against 
a restricted role for state antitrust regulation: ""Monopolies and restraints of trade are of infinite form and variety . . . .  Some 
expend their efforts almost wholly upon intrastate commerce and are of only local interest and some almost wholly upon 
interstate commerce and so become matters of national concern, and there are all graduations in between.  In many cases it 
would be very difficult to draw the line.  If State laws have no force as soon as interstate commerce begins to be affected, a very 
large area will be fenced off in which the States will be practically helpless to protect their citizens without, so far as we can 
perceive, any corresponding contribution to the national welfare . . . .  Especially is this true in view of the immense broadening 
in the conception of interstate commerce in recent years."" (326 Mass. at p. 265.)"
1360,14," The final paragraph of the opinion states: ""The argument that the Sherman Act necessarily invalidates many state laws 
regulating insurance we regard as [greatly] exaggerated."" (322 U.S. at p. 562 [88 L.Ed. at p. 1462].) In response to South-
Eastern, Congress enacted the McCarran-Ferguson Act which provides that federal law is only ""applicable to the business of 
insurance to the extent that such business is not regulated by state law."" ((1945) 59 Stat. 33, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1011, 1012.) "
1361,15," While Speegle relied on an antitrust case ( South-Eastern, supra), Coors necessarily relied on commerce clause decisions 
outside the field of antitrust because the Supreme Court, to my knowledge, has never specifically addressed itself to the 
question of the outer limit of state antitrust regulation of interstate commerce. Nevertheless, in every case I have found that 
raised the question factually, the high court has expressed a willingness to defer to state regulation. (See Waters-Pierce Oil Co. 
v. Texas (No. 1) (1909) 212 U.S. 86 [53 L.Ed. 417, 29 S.Ct. 220]; Standard Oil Co. v. Tennessee (1910) 217 U.S. 413 [54 L.Ed. 
817, 30 S.Ct. 543]; Straus v. Am. Publishers' Ass'n. (1913) 231 U.S. 222 [58 L.Ed. 192, 34 S.Ct. 84]; cf.  Gibbs v. Buick (1939) 
307 U.S. 66, 83 [83 L.Ed. 1111, 1121, 59 S.Ct. 725] [Black, J., dis.]; see also U.S. v. Underwriters Assn., supra 322 U.S. 533.) 
The early cases are of limited precedential value, however, since they only implicitly approved the application of state antitrust 
law, and also because these decisions were rendered in the era of strict adherence to the mechanical intrastate-interstate view 
of the commerce clause. It appears that in these early cases the court perceived the activity in question as purely intrastate in 
nature.  As an example, see Standard Oil's rejection of a contention that the Tennessee antitrust law constituted ""an 
unreasonable constitutional interference with commerce among the States."" (217 U.S. at p. 419 [54 L.Ed. at p. 820].) Justice 
Holmes responded: ""The mere fact that [the Tennessee act] may happen to remove an interference with commerce among the 
States as well with the rest does not invalidate it.  It hardly would be an answer to an indictment for forgery that the instrument 
forged was a foreign bill of lading, or for assault and battery that the person assaulted was engaged in peddling goods from 
another State.  How far Congress could deal with such cases we need not consider, but certainly there is nothing in the present 
state of the law at least that excludes the States from a familiar exercise of their power."" ( Id., at p. 422 [54 L.Ed. at p. 821], 
italics added.)"
1361,16," I note that commentators are ""overwhelmingly supportive of the extension of state antitrust regulation to include conduct and 
practices that, while possessing a local nexus, nonetheless 'affect' or are 'in' interstate commerce."" (Rubin, Rethinking State 
Antitrust Enforcement (1974) 26 U.Fla.L.Rev. 653, 670; see also Flynn, Federalism and State Antitrust Regulation, supra, at pp. 
56-108; Mosk, State Antitrust Enforcement (1962) 21 A.B.A., Antitrust Section 358; Note, The Commerce Clause and State 
Antitrust Enforcement (1961) 61 Colum.L.Rev. 1469.) "
1362,17," The lower courts accepted this inconsistent result, but they did so reluctantly.  One circuit court stated: ""We freely 
acknowledge our belief that Federal Baseball was not one of Justice Holmes' happiest days, that the rationale of Toolson is 
extremely dubious and that, to use the Supreme Court's own adjectives, the distinction between baseball and other professional 
sports is 'unrealistic,' 'inconsistent' and 'illogical.' [Citation.] . . . However, . . . we continue to believe that the Supreme Court 
should retain the exclusive privilege of overruling its own decisions . . . ."" ( Salerno v. American League of Prof. Baseball Clubs 
(2d Cir. 1970) 429 F.2d 1003, quoting Radovich v. National Football League, supra, 352 U.S. at p. 452 [1 L.Ed.2d at p. 461].) "
1364,18," I note that the preemption holding alone is sufficient to dispose of the Flood case.  If state antitrust regulation is completely 
preempted by the supremacy clause there is no need to weigh the state's interest in regulating the activity against the burden 
imposed upon interstate commerce. Under a commerce clause analysis, state interference is presumed valid unless it unduly 
burdens commerce; therefore, such analysis must be preceded by a judicial determination (or litigant's concession) that state 
law is not preempted by the supremacy clause. In Flood, the circuit court did not discuss supremacy clause preemption; nor did 
it comment on the district court's preemption holding.  It might be argued, therefore, that the high court's affirmance of the district 
court rendered the circuit court's commerce-clause-preclusion holding dictum, or that the court's affirmance of the circuit court is 
itself dictum."
1364,19," The Supreme Court has sustained preemption challenges against state law in most cases where the ""national interest"" 
implicated is in the area of national security or labor policy, neither of which is in issue here.  (See, e.g., Hines v. Davidowitz, 
supra, 312 U.S. 52; Pennsylvania v. Nelson (1956) 350 U.S. 497 [100 L.Ed. 640, 76 S.Ct. 477]; Garner v. Teamsters Union 
(1955) 346 U.S. 485 [98 L.Ed. 228, 74 S.Ct. 161]; Hill v. Florida (1945) 325 U.S. 538 [89 L.Ed. 1782, 65 S.Ct. 1373].)"
1364,20," Chief Justice Stone's statement in Parker v. Brown, supra, 317 U.S. at page 351 [87 L.Ed. at p. 326], is particularly apt in this 
regard: ""In a dual system of government in which, under the Constitution, the states are sovereign, save only as Congress may "
1365,," constitutionally subtract from their authority, an unexpressed purpose to nullify a state's [regulatory scheme] is not lightly to be 
attributed to Congress."""
1365,21," I recognize of course that state and federal lower courts have held state antitrust laws inapplicable to various professional 
sports. (See State v. Milwaukee Braves, Inc. (1966) 31 Wis.2d 699, 719-732 [144 N.W.2d 1], cert. den.  (1966) 385 U.S. 990 [17 
L.Ed.2d 451, 87 S.Ct. 598]; Matuszak v. Houston Oilers (Tex.Civ.App. 1974) 515 S.W.2d 725; Robertson v. National Basketball 
Association (S.D.N.Y. 1975) 389 F.Supp. 867, 880-881; HMC Management v. New Orleans Basketball Club (La.App. 1979) 375 
So.2d 700, 706, cert. den. (La. 1980) 379 So.2d 11.) These authorities, however, are not controlling. In Milwaukee Braves, a pre-Flood case, Wisconsin brought an action against 10 baseball teams alleging that the league's 
decision to move the Braves' franchise to Atlanta violated its state antitrust law. In holding state law inapplicable, the majority 
opinion obliquely stated that ""some members"" of the court believed state law was preempted under the supremacy clause while 
""other members"" preferred a commerce clause rationale.  In either event, the court makes clear that its decision was grounded 
on baseball's unique ""history of judicial action and legislative inaction"" and the resulting ""conflict between state and federal 
policy."" (31 Wis.2d at p. 721.) Moreover, ""transfer of a team franchise is certainly distinguishable (particularly with regard to the 
likelihood of state discrimination in favor of its own economic interests) from restraints imposed . . . upon players' freedom to 
negotiate, . . ."" ( Flood, supra, 316 F.Supp. 271, 279.) Similarly, HMC Management involved an attempt to keep the ""Jazz"" basketball team from moving from New Orleans.  Relying 
on Flood, the court held on preemption grounds that ""most of the violations that are alleged cannot be subject to Louisiana Anti-
Trust Laws."" (375 So.2d at p. 706.) The court held, however, that the alleged violation of a lease, if proven to be the result of 
anticompetitive conspiracy, would be subject to the state law. ( Id., at p. 707.) As I have explained, though, this court cannot, 
absent an unambiguous Supreme Court directive to the contrary, limit our state antitrust law to purely intrastate activities. In Matuszak, a football case, the Texas court simply quoted the circuit court's opinion in Flood and concluded, on ""federal pre-
emption"" grounds and without analysis, that the circuit court's ""holding is applicable to the instant case . . . [therefore], the 
question of whether Matuszak's contract violates federal law is a question for the Federal Courts."" (515 S.W.2d at pp. 728-729.) Finally, in Robertson a federal district court found ""the opinion of the Court of Appeals [in Flood] unquestionably applicable and 
controlling."" (389 F.Supp. at p. 880.) The court held state antitrust regulation inapplicable to professional basketball because that 
sport is in the ""'same business'"" as baseball, involving ""'substantial volumes of interstate . . . commerce.'"" ( Id., at p. 881.). To the extent that HMC Management, Matuszak and Robertson held (either without analysis or in reliance on the virtually 
identical league structures and interstate nature of professional sports) that state antitrust law is preempted or precluded, we 
should decline to follow these cases.  In my view we should not decide the instant case on the basis of the organizational 
similarities between professional football and baseball; rather, we should focus on the aberrant treatment historically accorded 
the latter sport. "
1367,22," I do not mean to suggest that under different factual circumstances state antitrust regulation may not unreasonably burden 
interstate commerce. Such a case, however, is not before us. "
1368,23," ""The test of whether both federal and state regulations may operate, or the state regulation must give way, is whether both 
regulations can be enforced without impairing the federal superintendence of the field, not whether they are aimed at similar or 
different objectives."" ( Florida Avocado Growers v. Paul, supra, 373 U.S. at p. 142 [10 L.Ed.2d at p. 257].) "
1375,1," References to FERC during the time prior to October 1, 1977, should be construed as referring to the Federal Power 
Commission, which had essentially the same statutory authority as FERC prior to the above-noted date."
1375,2," At the time the instant complaint was filed, the predecessor statutes to the above-cited provisions were in effect and governed 
public utilities' retail rates.  Except where specifically noted, the provisions of the Code are substantially identical to those of the 
prior act. "
1376,3," Defendant's motion for summary judgment was filed February 14, 1983.  Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint 
was filed February 18, 1983. "
1380,4," CAPCO consists of Ohio Edison, Penn Power, Duquesne Light, Toledo Edison and Cleveland Electric Illuminating Companies.  
""The group was formed in 1967 to enable the members to coordinate installation of generation and transmission in order to take 
advantage of economies of scale."" Complaint, para. 5. "
1390,1," Relevant portions of the Senate debate on the proposed bill are set forth below. Mr. FERGUSON. * * * By no means does the bill anticipate that any act would or should be passed which would create 
monopoly. Mr. O'MAHONEY. Then, does the Senator believe that the bill as it now stands permits that interpretation? Mr. FERGUSON. It would permit it. * * * I think the bill is broad enough to allow a state to pass a law allowing any 
agreement or contract other than those inhibited in paragraph (b) of section 4. But it is not the purpose of the bill at all to "
1391,," foster monopoly, or to anticipate that any act will be passed permitting or even encouraging monopoly. A state law * * * 
relating to regulation, for instance, the fixing of rates, or the fixing of the terms of a contract of insurance, which might under 
some definitions of monopoly be monopolistic, would be permitted under the pending bill; but if the state law undertook to 
authorize a boycott, a coercion, or an intimidation, or an agreement to do any one of those three things, then it would be 
clearly void because Congress would have already spoken, and once Congress speaks on interstate commerce, no state 
can speak contrary to the congressional declaration. 91 Cong. Rec. 480-81 (1945) (emphasis added). "
1394,1," The first amended complaint lists two plaintiffs: Supermarket of Homes, Inc., and the Original Supermarket of Homes, Inc.  The 
former is the predecessor corporation of the latter."
1394,2," At the time this suit was filed, plaintiff's practice was to charge a fixed commission of $1,995 per house."
1394,3, Other individual defendants have been dismissed from the suit.
1394,4," Since 1980, the MLS has disclosed only the commission to be paid to the selling or cooperating broker, and not the full 
commission payable to the listing broker."
1394,5," As a technical matter, both the amount of the overall commission, which is paid by the seller, and the amount of the ""split"" 
between the listing and cooperating brokers are negotiable.  The prevailing industry practice, however, appears to be to charge 
a six percent commission which is then split evenly between the two brokers. "
1395,6," Plaintiff estimates that over seventy-five percent of the home sales in the San Fernando Valley are effectuated by means of a 
subagency relationship entered into through the MLS."
1395,7," Plaintiff's original complaint, to which the present motion for summary judgment was directed, contained six causes of action.  
The first of these was disposed of on prior motion for summary judgment. The first amended complaint basically restates the 
allegations of the remaining five causes of action, adding the Original Supermarket of Homes as a plaintiff and consolidating two 
of the original price fixing claims into one.  The Court therefore treats defendants' motion as directed toward the present first 
amended complaint. "
1396,8," See First Amended Complaint P11 at 5.  In addition, the Proposed Joint Pretrial Conference Order, signed by counsel for all 
parties, contains the following stipulation: ""A Matter Which All Parties Agree is Not in the Case: As part of its proof, plaintiff does not intend to show that the Board, NAR, 
or CAR was party to any agreements with real estate agents by which the agents agreed with each other or with the Board, NAR 
or CAR not to show plaintiff's properties, and the parties agree that there is no such issue in the case."" Proposed Pretrial Conference Order at 11."
1396,9," See First Amended Complaint, P11 at 5."
1396,10," This theory is set forth in greatest detail in the declarations of plaintiff's expert, Dr. Conley."
1396,11," The Court must note at the outset that it has some difficulty understanding this aspect of plaintiff's theory.  In particular, it is not 
altogether clear why a buyer would be significantly concerned with the level of the commission paid by the seller to the listing 
and cooperating brokers. While some portion of the commission may be passed on to the buyer in the form of a higher purchase 
price, any such amount seems unlikely to be significant in comparison to the overall price.  At most, therefore, a buyer might 
attempt to use the fact that a seller will be paying little or no commission as a bargaining point in negotiations over the purchase 
price.  In comparison to the numerous other variables that a buyer must consider in selecting a home for purchase, the level of "
1397,," the commission payable by the seller would appear to be of doubtful importance to a buyer in deciding which homes he wishes 
to be shown."
1397,12," That this contention is the centerpiece of the complaint is borne out by plaintiff's prayer for relief, which requests:"
1397,1," .  A declaration that the rules and agreements of defendants prohibiting public access to the MLS violate sections 1 and 2 of 
the Sherman Act,"
1397,2," .  An injunction that defendants shall not create or enforce any rule which prohibits any person from placing a property listing in 
the Board's MLS for a price equal to the cost of processing such listing, including reasonable overhead and reserves,"
1397,3," .  An injunction that the Board shall print sufficient quantities of MLS materials to sell to the public for a price equal to the cost of 
processing such listing, including reasonable overhead and reserves,"

MLS to any member of the public,"

1397,13," Obviously, if none of plaintiff's theories of antitrust liability is applicable, plaintiff's allged injury at the hands of defendants will 
be immaterial, as any such injury would not be ""by reason of"" an antitrust violation, and plaintiff would lack standing under 
section 4. "

1400,18," The Court notes that under the present access rule, individuals who are bona fide prospective buyers of property may consult 
the MLS at no cost simply by going to a broker's office and asking to see it.  Such an individual incurs no cost in so doing, as the 
commission payable on any property listed in the MLS is independently set by the seller and the listing broker. If a cooperative 
broker does not wish to then take the individual to see a particular listed property, there is nothing to prevent the individual from 
approaching the listing broker directly."

1404,31," Plaintiff's evidence regarding this matter consists of transcripts of telephone conversations with officials of the two 
newspapers. See Declaration of Gina Williams, Exhs. Q-R. The transcript of the conversation with the Los Angeles Times indicates that the newspaper refused to continue running a 
nonspecific advertisement promoting plaintiff's low commissions in a space reserved for advertisements offering specific 
properties for sale after receiving some complaints from ""other brokers."" The transcript also indicates that the newspaper offered 
to continue running the advertisement if plaintiff would agree to revise it to include specific properties, or to move it to another 
space reserved for nonspecific advertisement of real estate services. The transcript of the conversation with the Los Angeles Herald Examiner indicates that the newspaper delayed approval of one 
of plaintiff's advertisements, apparently for fear of becoming embroiled in a legal controversy.  The record does not indicate 
whether the advertisement was eventually approved."

1411,2," Midwest also argues that a conspiracy to eliminate a competitor by unfair means is a per se violation because the conspiracy 
constitutes something akin to a market allocation agreement, a concerted refusal to deal, and a price fixing arrangement.  Brief 
of Plaintiff-Appellee and Cross-Appellant at 35-42.  Midwest contends that Melland's diversion of its corporate opportunities 
constituted a market allocation agreement because it diverted what would otherwise have been Midwest's share of the market.  
HN7[
] The essence of a market allocation violation, however, is that competitors apportion the market among themselves and 
cease competing in another's territory or for another's customers. There is no evidence of any market division here, either "
1412,," among the defendants or between Midwest and the defendants.  Instead, the defendants attempted to control Midwest's share 
of the market by excluding Midwest.  This does not constitute the type of anticompetitive conduct condemned as a per se 
unlawful market allocation. Neither does the alleged conspiracy constitute a concerted refusal to deal.  HN8[
] Concerted refusals to deal are generally 
characterized by conduct inducing a competitor's suppliers or customers to refuse to deal with that competitor. See, e.g., Radiant 
Burners, Inc. v. Peoples Gas Light & Coke Co., 364 U.S. 656, 5 L. Ed. 2d 358, 81 S. Ct. 365 (1961); Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-
Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741, 79 S. Ct. 705 (1959); Fashion Originators' Guild of America, Inc. v. Federal 
Trade Commission, 312 U.S. 457, 85 L. Ed. 949, 61 S. Ct. 703 (1941). Here, there is no allegation or evidence that Midwest's 
suppliers or customers have refused to deal with Midwest; nor is there evidence that the defendants have conspired to boycott 
those suppliers or customers to coerce such a refusal. Midwest's attempt to characterize the conspiracy as price fixing is also unconvincing.  The foreclosure of price rivalry between 
Midwest and the defendants does not, by itself, constitute price fixing, and there is no evidence of an agreement between 
Midwest and the defendants or of an agreement among the defendants to fix or manipulate the price of storage. That the 
defendants were able to charge more than Midwest would have charged does not compel the conclusion that they engaged in 
supracompetitive pricing. "
1414,3," The figure $ 3,911,637 was listed on plaintiff's exhibit 100, which set forth the manner in which Midwest's damage claim for 
LPG product shortage was calculated, and on plaintiff's exhibit 104, which summarized the various damage claims and is 
reconstructed as follows: SUMMARY OF DAMAGES Deal #1 - El Paso - Hutchinson Storage $ 3,686,500 Deals #2, 3 & 4 - El Paso - Canadian transactions $ 5,628,250 Empire Gas Underground Storage $ 400,000 Loss of value because additional 1,000,000 BBLS. of storage not developed in"

1422,3, The defendants have not appealed the district court's permanent injunction on the use of this equipment.
1422,4," On August 16, 1982, the district court modified its judgment to specify that the permanent injunction enjoined the defendants 
from soliciting or making sales to any party listed on the memorandum of Temple Tag's feeder tag customers prepared by Reed 
and from using or disclosing the contents of the memorandum to any other party. "
1423,5," For the text of this agreement, see note 2."
1423,6," The subject matter of trade secrets falls into two categories, technological and internal operating information. R. Callman, The 
Law of Unfair Competition, Trademarks, and Monopolies § 14.06 (4th Ed.1982).  Customer lists fall into the latter category. "
1424,7," At least one Texas appeals court case has suggested that the use of business information obtained by an employee in an 
unlawful manner from his employer will give rise to liability, though the information is not technically a trade secret. Jeter v. 
Associated Rack Corp., Tex.Civ.App.1980, 607 S.W.2d 272, 275-76. The Jeter court held that the key inquiry is whether the 
employee obtains access to confidential business information to facilitate the formation of a new corporation without the 
permission of the employer. The availability of a lawful means to acquire the information is not dispositive of the issue of a 
breach of confidentiality.  Id. at 275. See also Comment, Misappropriation of Trade Secrets, 53 Tul.L.Rev. 215, 226-27; R. 
Callman, The Law of Unfair Competition, Trademarks, and Monopolies § 14.03 at 21. Reed and Poncik acquired the business 
information at issue here during work hours, with the aid of other employees, and without Temple Tag's knowledge or 
permission.  Because we find that the customer information constituted a trade secret, we do not reach the issue of liability 
under this theory."
1424,8," Because the classification of information as a trade secret depends on the facts of each case, this area of the law is unsettled, 
resulting in seemingly conflicting opinions. The classification of customers lists is particularly confused. See Crouch v. Swing 
Machinery Co., Tex.Civ.App.1971, 468 S.W.2d 604 (Cadena, J., stating that ""the customer list cases stand on the periphery of 
that area of the law which can best be described as the 'trade secret quagmire '."") Id. at 607."
1424,9," Our decision is not inconsistent with Mercer v. C.A. Roberts Co., 5 Cir.1978, 570 F.2d 1232. In Mercer, the district court found 
that the information at issue could be obtained from other sources, and, therefore, did not constitute a trade secret. Id. at 1239. 
As in the case at bar, we concluded that the district court's finding of fact was not clearly erroneous. "
1448,1," The complaint alleges that plaintiffs are bringing the case both individually and as part of a class of patients injured by the 
defendants, but, as of this date, no motion for class certification has been brought or granted.  Thus, at this point, we are 
concerned only with allegations made by plaintiffs as individuals."
1448,2," Although not part of the pleadings, and thus not directly relevant to the motion presently before the Court, the Court notes that 
this allegation is not fanciful -- Dr. Capper pled guilty to Medicaid fraud in state court. "
1449,3," See, e.g., Moss v. Morgan Stanley, Inc., 553 F. Supp. 1347 (S.D.N.Y. 1983); Harper v. New Japan Securities, 545 F. Supp.

1981); North Barrington Development, Inc. v. Fanslow, 547 F. Supp. 207 (N.D. Ill. 1980). This includes cases in this district.  
See, e.g., Barker v. Underwriters At Lloyd's, London, 564 F. Supp. 352 (E.D. Mich. 1983); Landmark Savings & Loan v. 
Rhoades, 527 F. Supp. 206 (E.D. Mich. 1981)."

remarks of Rep. McCulloch).  The President's Commission on Law Enforcement also noted: ""In all of these illicit operations the 
'customers' -- in reality the victims -- are the people least able to afford criminal exploitation.  They are the poor, the uneducated,

1459,1," Two defendant medical organizations settled prior to trial and thus were not parties to the judgment.  Plaintiffs have not 
appealed from the judgment in favor of one defendant, the Chicago Medical Society.  Plaintiffs' complaint named individual 
members of the defendant associations as co-conspirators but not as defendants."
1459,2," Section 1 of the Sherman Act HN1[
] declares illegal ""every contract, combination . . ., or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce. . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 1 (1970). Section 2 prescribes penalties for ""every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to 
monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce. . . ."" 15 
U.S.C. § 2 (1970). "
1460,3," On appeal, plaintiffs raise no claim based solely on § 2. They assert conclusorily that the trial court erred with regard to those 
claims in its jury instructions on conspiracy, its failure to instruct the jury that good motives do not constitute a defense to either § 
1 or § 2 violations, and its admission of evidence on defendants' public health and welfare motives. They do not present specific 
argument on these issues.  Since we treat each of these points in light of plaintiffs' § 1 claims, and since plaintiffs failed to raise 
the § 2 claims in any meaningful fashion on appeal, we do not address separately their general assertion of claims based solely 
on § 2. "
1461,4," Spinal manipulation also is practiced by osteopathic physicians, physical therapists, and a small number of medical doctors. "
1462,5," This memorandum was characterized as a report of the Committee's activities during the previous seven years. The memorandum said: ""The Committee has not submitted such a report [earlier] because it believes that to make public some 
of its activities would have been and continues to be unwise. Thus this report is intended only for the information of the Board of 
Trustees."" "
1463,6," Defendant ACP argues that the trial court erred in admitting this exhibit, or alternatively, that the exhibit could not be the basis 
of an antitrust violation, because the activities it described were protected by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine.  Some of the 
committee's recommendations were directed toward protected activities. But others were not.  That some activities of a particular 
organization are protected by the first amendment does not shield all its activities, under Noerr-Pennington. "
1464,7," In part II, above, we have set forth those facts concerning what defendants actually did and with what effect, that a reasonable 
jury could have found from the evidence when viewed most favorably to plaintiffs.  In all that follows, we will assume that the jury 
did make such findings.  In this manner, the significance of error in the conduct of the trial, if any, can be tested. "
1467,8," ""Conspiracies are illegal"" is taken from the reporter's transcript of the instructions as read by the trial judge.  It is clear from the 
joint appendix that the judge intended to say: ""The conspiracies are illegal."" Whether the error was his or the reporter's, we are 
sure that the jury understood the reference to be to the kind of conspiracies described in the immediately preceding sentence. "
1472,9," Defendants explain that the phrases ""genuineness of the defendants' justification"" and ""reasonableness of the standards 
themselves"" were drawn from Feminist Women's Health Center, Inc. v. Mohammad, 586 F.2d 530 (5th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 
444 U.S. 924, 62 L. Ed. 2d 180, 100 S. Ct. 262 (1979). An abortion clinic claimed, among other things, that the defendant 
medical doctors had conspired to boycott it, and the district court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment.  In 
reversing in part, the court of appeals commented that even if defendants' efforts to enforce professional standards were to be 
tested by the rule of reason, rather than the per se rule, factual issues remained ""as to the genuineness of the defendants' 
justification, the reasonableness of the standards themselves, and the manner of their enforcement."" Id. at 547. The Fifth 
Circuit's choice of words in its cryptic dealing with this summary judgment question cannot fairly be accorded the immense 
significance attributed to it by defendants in the context of the case before us. "
1477,10," Plaintiffs contend, also, that the court failed to instruct on one of their conspiracy theories: namely, that the individual members 
of each defendant organization conspired among themselves.  Although not explicit on the point, the instructions as given (e.g., 
""plaintiffs . . . have alleged that . . . the defendants and their members have agreed . . ."") were sufficient to reveal to the jury that 
this was one of plaintiffs' theories. "
1479,11," The motion by the Health Care Equalization Committee of the Iowa Chiropractic Society, pursuant to Federal Rules of 
Appellate Procedure 27, for the limited purpose of obtaining access to discovery, is denied. "
