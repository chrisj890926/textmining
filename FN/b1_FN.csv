28,1," The Order provides in relevant part: It Is Further Ordered that said respondent corporations . . . General Cable Corporations . . . Habirshaw Cable and Wire 
Corporation . . . The Okonite Company, Phelps-Dodge Copper Products Corporation . . . and their successors, officers, agents 
and employees, and the respondent, National Electrical Manufacturers Association, cease and desist, in connection with the 
business of selling and offering for sale impregnated paper cable, . . . in interstate commerce, from doing and performing, by 
agreement, combination or conspiracy between or among any two or more of said respondent corporations acting directly or by 
or through the respondent, National Electrical Manufacturers Association, the following acts and things: (1) Fixing maintaining or enhancing prices, special charges, discounts, transportation charges or any terms or conditions of sale 
which terms or conditions constitute a substantial element in competition; (2) Providing that any price lists compiled and distributed by any of them among their competitors are to be adopted and 
adhered to until modifications thereof are similarly compiled and distributed with the result that such original lists and 
amendments are so adopted and adhered to by any of them and their competitors;. . . (4) Participating with competitors in initiating or conducting any investigation for the purpose of ascertaining and reporting for 
their joint benefit if, when and to what extent any competitor has deviated from any price list or any announced or quoted price, 
or otherwise bringing pressure or persuasion to bear upon competitors not to deviate from any such price list or price, provided 
that this paragraph shall not prevent the circulation of reports of the prices, terms, conditions and like particulars of closed 
transactions, when not done for the purpose of policing the activities prohibited in paragraphs (1) or (2);. . . In re National Electrical Manufacturers Ass'n (No. 2565, Dec. 29, 1936). "
51,1," According to plaintiffs, TRW had previously offered to purchase Eagle in 1978 for 70,000 shares of TRW stock, which then sold 
for $60 per share. The deal was never consummated, allegedly because TRW was concerned that the warrants held by the 
SBICs would create problems after the acquisition, and because TRW believed that Eagle lacked the management services that 
Abbott and Lassar were supposed to provide. "
53,2," Kaushal did not address these cases, but it did note that the current antitrust law contains the ""and shall recover"" language in 
a section separate from that specifically authorizing private injunctive relief, a section not contained in RICO.  Kaushal, 556 F. 
Supp. at 583 & n. 22. "
54,3," We do not reach the issue whether preliminary injunctive relief would be available to a private RICO plaintiff in extraordinary 
circumstances, such as where necessary to prevent a disposition or dissipation of assets pending a final money judgment. "
55,4," That the funds happen to be held in trust at present does not affect matters. We would not be ""ordering"" the trustee to pay to 
one party or another but rather permitting one or the other party to receive the funds held in trust."
55,5," In Car Carriers, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 583 F. Supp. 221 (N.D. Ill. 1984), Judge Shadur addressed a RICO claim in which 
""equitable rescission"" of a lease was sought.  Id. at 227. Though other grounds for dismissal existed thus obviating the need to 
address the availability of such a remedy under RICO, Judge Shadur suggested that were he called upon to do so, he would 
hold that Kaushal applied to equitable rescission as well. Id. To the extent that Judge Shadur's dictum in Car Carriers conflicts 
with what we state above, we respectfully disagree. "
56,6," We do not hold to the view that a RICO plaintiff must show damages amounting to ""racketeering enterprise injury"" or the like. 
We have previously rejected that view. Addis v. Moser, No. 83 C 6118 (N.D. Ill.  Feb. 15, 1984). "
57,7," We note that Anvil Investment, which upheld an award of punitive damages to a purchaser defrauded in violation of the Illinois 
Act, relied solely on federal case authority for the proposition that awards of punitive damages may be made under a statute 
absent specific legislative authorization. 85 Ill. App. 3d at    , 407 N.E.2d at 653. Further, the court seemingly disregarded a 
federal decision from which it quoted extensively, which held that punitive damages were unavailable under the federal statute 
parallel to the provision of the Illinois Act at issue in Anvil. Id. (citing Globus v. Law Research Service, Inc. 418 F.2d 1276 (2d 
Cir. 1969)). "
71,1, Editors Note: No text for footnote 1 appears on the manuscript copy of the order. 
74,2," The process of defining a relevant market is well stated by Professor Areeda: A vast number of firms might have some actual or potential effect on a defendant's behavior.  Many of them, however, will 
not have a significant effect and we attempt to exclude them from the ""relevant market"" for appraising defendant's power.  
We try to include in the relevant market only those suppliers -- of this same or related product in the same or related 
geographic area -- whose existence significantly restrains defendant's power.  This process of inclusion and exclusion is 
spoken of as ""market definition."" P. Areeda, Antitrust Analysis: Problems, Text, Cases para. 231, at 239-40 (1981). Here, generally speaking, the relevant market is restaurants similar to Waffle House -- those with similar menus, hours, and 
service. "
77,3," Section 4 of the Clayton Act 15 U.S.C. § 15 HN20[
] conditions a private action on this showing. Even if the practice is a per 
se violation of the law, the plaintiff must show economic injury to itself.  Warriner Hermetics, Inc. v. Copeland Refrigeration, 463 
F.2d 1002, 1016 (5th Cir.1972). Said another way, plaintiff must show the fact of injury which means that what the defendant did 
impacted in some way on plaintiff's business.  To show injury means that plaintiff must be able to demonstrate that it suffered 
economic damages which are quantifiable.  McClure v. Undersea Industries, 671 F.2d 1287, 1289 (11th Cir.1982). See also

87,1," The chairman of the board and chief executive officer of both Copperweld and Regal, Phillip H. Smith, was also named as a 
defendant.  In addition, respondents originally charged petitioners and Smith with an attempt to monopolize the market for 
structural steel tubing in violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 2. Before trial respondent 
dismissed Smith as a defendant and dismissed its § 2 monopolization count. Petitioners counterclaimed on the ground that respondent and Grohne had used proprietary information belonging to Regal, had 
competed unfairly by hiring away key Regal personnel, and had interfered with prospective business relationships by filing the 
lawsuit on the eve of a large Copperweld debenture offering.  At the close of the evidence, the court directed a verdict against 
petitioners on their counterclaims.  The disposition of these claims is not at issue before this Court."
87,2," The jury was instructed to consider many different factors: for instance, whether Copperweld and Regal had separate 
management staffs, separate corporate officers, separate clients, separate records and bank accounts, separate corporate 
offices, autonomy in setting policy, and so on.  The jury also was instructed to consider ""any other facts that you find are relevant 
to a determination of whether or not Copperweld and Regal are separate and distinct companies."" App. to Pet. for Cert. B-9. "
88,3," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides in pertinent part: HN1[
] ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among 
the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal.  Every person who shall make any contract or engage in any 
combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony."" 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U. S. 
C. § 1."
88,4," Under the arrangements condemned in Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U.S. 197, 354 (1904) (plurality opinion), 
""all the stock [a railroad holding company] held or acquired in the constituent companies was acquired and held to be used in 
suppressing competition between those companies.  It came into existence only for that purpose."" In Standard Oil Co. v. United 
States, 221 U.S. 1 (1911), and United States v. American Tobacco Co., 221 U.S. 106 (1911), the trust or holding company 
device brought together previously independent firms to lessen competition and achieve monopoly power.  Although the Court in 
the latter case suggested that the contracts between affiliated companies, and not merely the original combination, could be "
89,," viewed as the conspiracy, id., at 184, the Court left no doubt that ""the combination in and of itself"" was a restraint of trade and a 
monopolization, id., at 187."
89,5," Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, post, at 779, 788, n. 18, our point is not that Yellow Cab found only the initial acquisition 
illegal; our point is that the illegality of the initial acquisition was a predicate for its holding that any postacquisition conduct 
violated the Act."
89,6," When discussing the fact that some of the affiliated Chicago operating companies did not compete to obtain exclusive 
transportation contracts held by another of the affiliated companies, the Court stated: ""[The] fact that the competition restrained is that between affiliated corporations cannot serve to negative the statutory violation 
where, as here, the affiliation is assertedly one of the means of effectuating the illegal conspiracy not to compete."" 332 U.S., at 
229 (emphasis added). The passage quoted in text is soon followed by a cite to United States v. Crescent Amusement Co., 323 U.S. 173, 189 (1944). 
Crescent Amusement found violations of §§ 1 and 2 by film exhibitors affiliated (in most cases) by 50 percent ownership.  The 
exhibitors used the monopoly power they possessed in certain towns to force film distributors to give them favorable terms in 
other towns.  The Court found it unnecessary to view the distributors as part of the conspiracy, id., at 183, so the Court plainly 
viewed the affiliated entities themselves as the conspirators. The Crescent Amusement Court, however, in affirming an order of 
divestiture, noted that such a remedy was appropriate when ""creation of the combination is itself the violation."" Id., at 189. This 
suggests that both Crescent Amusement and Yellow Cab, which cited the very page on which this passage appears, stand for a 
narrow rule based on the original illegality of the affiliation. The dissent misconstrues a later passage in Crescent Amusement stating that divestiture need not be limited to those affiliates 
whose ""acquisition was part of the fruits of the conspiracy,"" 323 U.S., at 189. See post, at 780-781.  This meant only that 
divestiture could apply to affiliates other than those who were driven out of business by the practices of the original conspirators 
and who were then acquired illegally to increase the combination's monopoly power.  See 323 U.S., at 181. It did not mean that 
affiliates acquired for lawful purposes were subject to divestiture."
89,7," Appalachian Coals does state that the key question is whether there is an unreasonable restraint of trade or an attempt to 
monopolize.  ""If there is, the combination cannot escape because it has chosen corporate form; and, if there is not, it is not to be 
condemned because of the absence of corporate integration."" 288 U.S., at 377. Appalachian Coals, however, validated a 
cooperative selling arrangement among independent entities. The statement that intracorporate relationships would be subject to 
liability under § 1 is thus dictum.  The statement may also envision merely the limited rule in Yellow Cab pertaining to 
acquisitions that are themselves anticompetitive. "
90,8," In two cases decided soon after Yellow Cab on facts similar to Crescent Amusement, see n. 6, supra, affiliated film exhibitors 
were found to have conspired in violation of § 1. Schine Chain Theatres, Inc. v. United States, 334 U.S. 110 (1948); United 
States v. Griffith, 334 U.S. 100 (1948). Griffith simply assumed that the companies were capable of conspiring with each other; 
Schine cited Yellow Cab and Crescent Amusement for the proposition, 334 U.S., at 116. In both cases, however, an intra-
enterprise conspiracy holding was unnecessary not only because the Court found a § 2 violation, but also because the affiliated 
exhibitors had conspired with independent film distributors.  See ibid.; Griffith, supra, at 103, n. 6, 109."
90,9," LEdHN[3B][
] [3B] Although the plaintiff apparently never acquiesced in the resale price maintenance scheme, Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. 
Seagram & Sons, Inc., 182 F.2d 228, 231 (CA7 1950), rev'd, 340 U.S. 211 (1951), one of the subsidiaries did gain the 
compliance of other wholesalers after once terminating them for refusing to abide by the pricing scheme.  See 182 F.2d, at 231; 
340 U.S., at 213. A theory of combination between the subsidiaries and the wholesalers could now support § 1 relief, whether or 
not it could have when Kiefer-Stewart was decided.  See Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145, 149-150, and n. 6 (1968); United 
States v. Parke, Davis & Co., 362 U.S. 29 (1960). "
91,10," See United States v. Timken Roller Bearing Co., 83 F.Supp. 284, 311-312 (ND Ohio 1949), aff'd as modified, 341 U.S. 593 
(1951). The agreement of an individual named Dewar, who owned 24 and 50 percent of the foreign corporations respectively, 
was apparently required for the American defendant to have its way."
91,11," For almost 20 years before they became affiliated by stock ownership, two of the corporations had been party to the sort of 
restrictive agreements the Timken Court condemned.  Three Justices upholding antitrust liability were of the view that Timken's 
""interests in the [foreign] companies were obtained as part of a plan to promote the illegal trade restraints"" and that the 
""intercorporate relationship"" was ""the core of the conspiracy."" Id., at 600-601.  Because two Justices found no antitrust violation 
at all, see id., at 605 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting); id., at 606 (Jackson, J., dissenting), and two Justices did not take part, 
apparently only Chief Justice Vinson and Justice Reed were prepared to hold that there was a violation even if the initial 
acquisition itself was not illegal.  See id., at 601-602 (Reed, J., joined by Vinson, C. J., concurring)."
91,12," The doctrine has long been criticized.  See, e. g., Areeda, Intra-enterprise Conspiracy in Decline, 97 Harv. L. Rev. 451 (1983); 
Handler & Smart, The Present Status of the Intracorporate Conspiracy Doctrine, 3 Cardozo L. Rev. 23 (1981); Kempf, Bathtub

92,13," LEdHN[5B][
] [5B] Section 2 of the Sherman Act provides in pertinent part: HN3[
] ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or 
persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed 
guilty of a felony."" 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 2. By making a conspiracy to monopolize unlawful, § 2 does reach 
both concerted and unilateral behavior.  The point remains, however, that purely unilateral conduct is illegal only under § 2 and 
not under § 1.  Monopolization without conspiracy is unlawful under § 2, but restraint of trade without a conspiracy or 
combination is not unlawful under § 1."
92,14," LEdHN[6B][
] [6B] For example, the Court has declared that § 2 does not forbid market power to be acquired ""as a consequence of a superior 
product, [or] business acumen."" United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 571 (1966). We have also made clear that the 
""antitrust laws . . . were enacted for 'the protection of competition, not competitors.'"" Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 
429 U.S. 477, 488 (1977) (damages for violation of Clayton Act § 7) (quoting Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294,

Report of the Attorney General's National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws 31 (1955).  At the same time, many courts have 
created an exception for corporate officers acting on their own behalf.  See, e. g., H & B Equipment Co. v. International 
Harvester Co., 577 F.2d 239, 244 (CA5 1978) (dictum); Greenville Publishing, supra; Johnston v. Baker, 445 F.2d 424, 427 
(CA3 1971). LEdHN[12B][
] [12B] LEdHN[13B][
] [13B]Nothing in the language of the Sherman Act is inconsistent with the view that 
corporations cannot conspire with their own officers.  It is true that a ""person"" under the Act includes both an individual and a 
corporation.  15 U. S. C. § 7. But § 1 does not declare every combination between two ""persons"" to be illegal.  Instead it makes 
liable every ""person"" engaging in a combination or conspiracy ""hereby declared to be illegal."" As we note, the principles 
governing § 1 liability plainly exclude from unlawful combinations or conspiracies the activities of a single firm."
93,16," See 691 F.2d 310, 316 (CA7 1982) (decision below); Cliff Food Stores, Inc. v. Kroger, Inc., 417 F.2d 203, 205-206 (CA5

1062 (1970); Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 109 U. S. App. D. C., at 174, 284 F.2d, at 603."
93,17," The Court left this issue unresolved in Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 368 U.S., at 469, n. 4. "
94,18," As applied to a wholly owned subsidiary, the so-called ""single entity"" test is thus inadequate to preserve the Sherman Act's 
distinction between unilateral and concerted conduct.  Followed by the Seventh Circuit below as well as by other Courts of 
Appeals, this test sets forth various criteria for evaluating whether a given parent and subsidiary are capable of conspiring with 
each other.  See n. 2, supra; see generally Ogilvie v. Fotomat Corp., 641 F.2d 581 (CA8 1981); Las Vegas Sun, Inc. v. Summa 
Corp., 610 F.2d 614 (CA9 1979), cert. denied, 447 U.S. 906 (1980); Photovest Corp. v. Fotomat Corp., 606 F.2d 704 (CA7 
1979), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 917 (1980). These criteria measure the ""separateness"" of the subsidiary: whether it has separate 
control of its day-to-day operations, separate officers, separate corporate headquarters, and so forth.  At least when a subsidiary 
is wholly owned, however, these factors are not sufficient to describe a separate economic entity for purposes of the Sherman 
Act. The factors simply describe the manner in which the parent chooses to structure a subunit of itself.  They cannot overcome 
the basic fact that the ultimate interests of the subsidiary and the parent are identical, so the parent and the subsidiary must be 
viewed as a single economic unit."
94,19," Because an ""agreement"" between a parent and its wholly owned subsidiary is no more likely to be anticompetitive than an 
agreement between two divisions of a single corporation, it does not matter that the parent ""availed [itself] of the privilege of 
doing business through separate corporations,"" Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 141 (1968). 
The purposeful choice of a parent corporation to organize a subunit as a subsidiary is not itself a reason to heighten antitrust 
scrutiny, because it is not laden with anticompetitive risk."
94,20," For example, ""[separate] incorporation may reduce federal or state taxes or facilitate compliance with regulatory or reporting 
laws.  Local incorporation may also improve local identification.  Investors or lenders may prefer to specialize in a particular 
aspect of a conglomerate's business.  Different parts of the business may require different pension or profitsharing plans or 
different accounting practices."" Areeda, 97 Harv. L. Rev., at 453. "
95,21," Sunkist Growers provides strong support for the notion that separate incorporation does not necessarily imply a capacity to 
conspire. The defendants in that case were an agricultural cooperative, its wholly owned subsidiary, and a second cooperative 
comprising only members of the first.  The Court refused to find a § 1 or § 2 conspiracy among them because they were ""one 
'organization' or 'association' even though they have formally organized themselves into three separate legal entities."" 370 U.S., 
at 29. Although this holding derived from statutory immunities granted to agricultural organizations, the reasoning of Sunkist 
Growers supports the broader principle that substance, not form, should determine whether a separately incorporated entity is 
capable of conspiring under § 1."
95,22," See Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc. v. Hawaiian Oke & Liquors, Ltd., 416 F.2d 71 (CA9 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1062 
(1970)."
95,23," The dissent argues that references in the legislative history to ""trusts"" suggest that Congress intended § 1 to govern the 
conduct of all affiliated corporations.  See post, at 787-788.  But those passages explicitly refer to combinations created for the 
very purpose of restraining trade.  None of the cited debates refers to the postacquisition conduct of corporations whose initial 
affiliation was lawful.  Indeed, Senator Sherman stated: ""It is the unlawful combination, tested by the rules of common law and human experience, that is aimed at by this bill, and not 
the lawful and useful combination."" 21 Cong. Rec. 2457 (1890). "
96,24," LEdHN[12D][
] [12D] Even if common-law intracorporate conspiracies were firmly established when Congress passed the Sherman Act, the obvious 
incompatibility of an intracorporate conspiracy with § 1 is sufficient to refute the dissent's suggestion that Congress intended to 
incorporate such a definition.  See post, at 784-787.  Moreover, it is far from clear that intracorporate conspiracies were 
recognized at common law in 1890.  Even today courts disagree whether corporate employees can conspire with themselves or 
with the corporation for purposes of certain statutes, such as 42 U. S. C. § 1985(3).  Compare, e. g., Novotny v. Great Am. Fed. 
Sav. & Loan Assn., 584 F.2d 1235 (CA3 1978) (en banc), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 442 U.S. 366 (1979), with 
Dombrowski v. Dowling, 459 F.2d 190 (CA7 1972). And in 1890 it was disputed whether a corporation could itself be guilty of a 
crime that required criminal intent, such as conspiracy. Commentators appear to agree that courts began finding corporate 
liability for such crimes only around the turn of the century.  See generally Edgerton, Corporate Criminal Responsibility, 36 Yale 
L. J. 827, 828, and n. 11 (1927); Miller, Corporate Criminal Liability: A Principle Extended to Its Limits, 38 Fed. Bar J. 49 (1979); 
Note, 60 Harv. L. Rev. 283, 284, and n. 9 (1946). Of course, Congress changed that common-law rule when it explicitly provided 
that a corporation could be guilty of a § 1 conspiracy. But the point remains that the Sherman Act did not import a pre-existing 
common-law tradition recognizing conspiracies between corporations and their own employees."

government has not relied on the doctrine in recent years."" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26, n. 42. "
98,1," The language I have quoted, most of which is overlooked by the majority, makes it clear that the Court's adoption of the 
concept of conspiracy between affiliated corporations was unqualified.  As the first word of the sentence indicates, the Court's 
following statement: ""Similarly, any affiliation or integration flowing from an illegal conspiracy cannot insulate the conspirators 
from the sanctions which Congress has imposed,"" 332 U.S., at 227, expresses a separate if related point."
98,2," ""[By] preventing the cab operating companies under their control from purchasing cabs from manufacturers other than CCM, 
the appellees deny those companies the opportunity to purchase cabs in a free, competitive market.  The Sherman Act has 
never been thought to sanction such a conspiracy to restrain the free purchase of goods in interstate commerce."" Id., at 226-227 
(footnote omitted)."
98,3," ""[The] combining of the open and closed towns for the negotiation of films for the circuit was a restraint of trade and the use of 
monopoly power in violation of § 1 and § 2 of the Act.  The concerted action of the parent company, its subsidiaries, and the 
named officers and directors in that endeavor was a conspiracy which was not immunized by reason of the fact that the 
members were closely affiliated rather than independent.  See United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U.S. 218, 227; United 
States v. Crescent Amusement Co., 323 U.S. 173."" 334 U.S., at 116. "
99,4," In Kiefer-Stewart, Seagram unsuccessfully argued that Yellow Cab was confined to cases concerning unlawful acquisitions, 
see Brief for Respondents, O. T. 1950, No. 297, p. 21.  Thus the Kiefer-Stewart Court considered and rejected exactly the same 
argument embraced by today's majority."
99,5," ""The fact that there is common ownership or control of the contracting corporations does not liberate them from the impact of 
the antitrust laws. E. g., Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Seagram & Sons, [340 U.S.,] at 215.  Nor do we find any support in reason or 
authority for the proposition that agreements between legally separate persons and companies to suppress competition among 
themselves and others can be justified by labeling the project a 'joint venture.' Perhaps every agreement and combination to 
restrain trade could be so labeled."" 341 U.S., at 598."
99,6," ""There remains for consideration only the Court of Appeals' alternative holding that the Sherman Act claim should be dismissed 
because respondents were all part of a single business entity and were therefore entitled to cooperate without creating an illegal

separate corporations, the fact of common ownership could not save them from any of the obligations that the law imposes on 
separate entities. See Timken Co. v. United States, 341 U.S. 593, 598 (1951); United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U.S. 218,

even commonly owned firms must compete against each other, if they hold themselves out as distinct entities. 'The corporate

102,18," This legislative history thus demonstrates the error in the majority's conclusion that only acquisitions of corporate affiliates fall 
within § 1. See ante, at 761-762.  The conduct of the trusts that Senator Sherman and others objected to went much further than 
mere acquisitions. Indeed, the irony of the Court's approach is that, had it been adopted in 1890, it would have meant that § 1 
would have no application to trust combinations which had already been formed -- the very trusts to which Senator Sherman was 
referring. I cannot believe that the Court really intends to express doubt as to whether the Congress that passed the Sherman Act thought 
conspiracy doctrine could apply to corporations.  Ante, at 775-776, n. 24.  If that were not the case, then the Sherman Act would 
have no application to corporations.  Since, as is clear and as the Court concedes, the Sherman Act does apply to corporations, 
there can be no doubt that Congress intended to apply the law of conspiracy to agreements between corporations. "
103,19," Market power is the ability to raise prices above those that would be charged in a competitive market.  See Jefferson Parish 
Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 27, n. 46 (1984); United States Steel Corp. v. Fortner Enterprises, Inc., 429 U.S. 610, 620 
(1977); United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 391 (1956)."
103,20," Significantly, the Court never suggests that the plurality-of-actors requirement has any intrinsic economic significance.  Rather, 
it suggests that the requirement has evidentiary significance: combinations are more likely to signal anticompetitive conduct than 
is unilateral activity: ""In any conspiracy, two or more entities that previously pursued their own interests separately are combining 
to act as one for their common benefit.  This not only reduces the diverse directions in which economic power is aimed but 
suddenly increases the economic power moving in one particular direction."" Ante, at 769.  That is true, but it is also true of any 
ordinary commercial contract between separate entities, as can be seen if one substitutes the word ""contract"" for ""conspiracy"" in 
the passage I have quoted.  The language of the Sherman Act indicates that it treats ""contracts"" and ""conspiracies"" as 
equivalent concepts -- both satisfy the multiplicity-of-actors requirement -- and yet one of the most fundamental points in antitrust 
jurisprudence, dating at least to Standard Oil, is that there is nothing inherently anticompetitive about a contract.  Similarly, an 
agreement to act ""for common benefit"" in itself is unremarkable -- all agreements are in some sense a restraint of trade be they 
contracts or conspiracies. It is only when trade is unreasonably restrained that § 1 is implicated.  The Court's evidentiary concern 
lacks merit."
103,21," We made this point in the context of resale price maintenance in United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., 362 U.S. 29 (1960): ""The Sherman Act forbids combinations of traders to suppress competition.  True, there results the same economic effect as is 
accomplished by a prohibited combination to suppress price competition if each customer, although induced to do so solely by a 
manufacturer's announced policy, independently decides to observe specified resale prices.  So long as Colgate is not 
overruled, this result is tolerated but only when it is the consequence of a mere refusal to sell in the exercise of a manufacturer's 
right 'freely to exercise his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal.'"" Id., at 44 (quoting Colgate, 250 
U.S., at 307)."
103,22," ""[It] is the potential which this conspiracy concept holds for the development of a rational enforcement policy which, if anything, 
will ultimately attract the courts.  If conduct of a single corporation which restrains trade were to violate Section 1, a forceful 
weapon would be available to the government with which to challenge conduct which in oligopolistic industries creates or 
reinforces entry barriers.  Excessive advertising in the cereal, drug, or detergent industries, annual style changes in the auto 
industry, and other such practices could be reached as soon as they threatened to inhibit competition; there would be no need to 
wait until a 'dangerous probability' of monopoly had been reached, the requirement under Section 2 'attempt' doctrine.  Nor 
would a single firm restraint of trade rule be overbroad.  It would in no way threaten single firm activity -- setting a price, deciding 
what market it would deal in, or the like -- which did not threaten competitive conditions."" L. Sullivan, supra n. 9, § 114, at 324 
(footnotes omitted)."
103,23," This was the case in Kiefer-Stewart, for example.  Seagram had refused to sell liquor to Kiefer-Stewart unless it agreed to an 
illegal resale price maintenance scheme.  Kiefer-Stewart refused to agree, and as a result was injured by losing access to 
Seagram's products.  See 340 U.S., at 213. "
104,24," See United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 588-593 (1981) (discussing congressional findings underlying the Organized 
Crime Control Act of 1970).  Section 1 of the Sherman Act has on occasion been used against various types of racketeering 
activity.  See Hartwell, Criminal RICO and Antitrust, 52 Antitrust L. J. 311, 312-313 (1983); McLaren, Antitrust and Competition -- 
Review of the Past Year and Suggestions for the Future, in New York State Bar Assn., 1971 Antitrust Law Symposium 1, 3 
(1971)."
104,25," See Comment, Decisionmaking, supra n. 9, at 1753-1757; Note, Suggested Standard, supra n. 9, at 735-738.  Professor 
Sullivan elaborates: ""Picture, at one end of the spectrum, a family business which operates one retail store in each of three or four adjacent 
communities.  All of the stores are managed as a unit by one individual, the founder of the business who sets policy, does all the 
buying, decides on all the advertising, sets prices, and hires and fires all employees other than family members.  The fact that 
each store is operated by a separate corporation should not convert a family business into a cartel. . . .  If there is, as a practical 
matter, an integrated ownership and management, this small business is a single firm.  And a single firm cannot compete with 
itself.  Hence it cannot restrain price competition with itself, or divide markets with itself, or act as a common purchasing agent 
for itself or otherwise restrain competition with itself, regardless of how many separate corporations the single firm may, for 
reasons unrelated to the act, be divided into."" L. Sullivan, supra n. 9, § 114, at 326-327."
104,26," Thus, the Court is wrong to suggest, ante, at 771-772, 774-776, and n. 24, that Yellow Cab could reach truly unilateral conduct 
involving only the employees of a single firm."
104,27," If the rule of Yellow Cab and its progeny could be easily circumvented through, for example, use of unincorporated divisions 
instead of subsidiaries, then there would be reason to question its efficacy as a tool for rational antitrust enforcement.  However, 
the Court is incorrect when it asserts, ante, at 770-771, 772-774, that there is no economic substance in a distinction between 
unincorporated divisions, which cannot provide a plurality of actors, and wholly owned subsidiaries, which under Yellow Cab 
can.  If that were the case, incorporated subsidiaries would never be used to achieve integration -- the ready availability of an 
unincorporated alternative would always be employed in order to avoid antitrust liability.  The answer is provided by the Court 
itself -- the use of subsidiaries often makes possible operating efficiencies that are unavailable through the use of unincorporated 
divisions.  Ante, at 772-774.  We may confidently assume that any corporate parent whose contingent antitrust liability exceeds 
the savings it realizes through the use of subsidiaries already utilizes unincorporated divisions instead of corporate subsidiaries. 
Thus, it is more than merely a question of form when a decision is made to use corporate subsidiaries instead of unincorporated 
divisions, and the rule is not that easily circumvented. "
105,28," See L. Sullivan, supra n. 9, § 114, at 328 (""To have two competitors acting concertedly two separate firms, not just persons, 
are needed.  Thus 'concerted action' by two 'legal persons' which is limited solely to the internal management of a single firm 
does not restrain competition; but 'concerted action' by two 'legal persons' which erects barriers to entry by another separate 
firm, a competitor or potential competitor, can be a restraint of trade""); see also Willis & Pitofsky, supra n. 9, at 38-41.  The 
Attorney General's National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws made the same point in 1955: ""The substance of the Supreme Court decisions is that concerted action between a parent and subsidiary or between 
subsidiaries which has for its purpose or effect coercion or unreasonable restraint on the trade of strangers to those acting in 
concert is prohibited by Section 1.  Nothing in these opinions should be interpreted as justifying the conclusion that concerted 
action solely between a parent and subsidiary or subsidiaries, the purpose and effect of which is not coercive restraint of the 
trade of strangers to the corporate family, violates Section 1.  Where such concerted action restrains no trade and is designed to 
restrain no trade other than that of the parent and its subsidiaries, Section 1 is not violated."" Attorney General's Committee 
Report, supra n. 9, at 34."
105,29," Professor Sullivan provides another example: ""[Picture] a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary (or two corporations wholly owned by the same parent or 
stockholder group) which operate, respectively, a newspaper and a radio station in the same city.  If the radio station, which has 
no local competitors, were to deny advertising to a local business because the latter advertised in a rival newspaper, the 
integration between the two corporations, however close in terms of ownership or management or both, would not protect them 
from a charge of conspiracy to restrain trade. . . .  [The] concerted action here involved is not merely carrying on the business of 
a single integrated firm, it is action which is aimed at restraining trade by utilizing such market power as is possessed by the firm 
because of its radio station in order to erect a competitive barrier in front of a competitor of the firm's newspaper."" L. Sullivan, 
supra n. 9, § 114, at 327 (footnote omitted). "
106,30," E. g., Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36 (1977). "
121,1," Since the parties agree that the issues before the court are issues of law which may be decided from the face of the pleadings, 
the court will expressly treat the motion brought pursuant to Rule 12(c), and then rule upon the alternative summary judgment 
motion as a matter of course. "
122,2," Possibly, plaintiff did not even intend to allege that the defendants discriminated against it and in favor of direct purchasing 
retailers, but rather sought in Amended Complaint para. 31 to allege only that the defendants discriminated against its customers 
by failing to furnish proportionately equal allowances, services or facilities to either those customers, or to it. See F.T.C. v. Fred 
Meyer, Inc., 390 U.S. at 358 (Nothing we have said bars a supplier . . . from utilizing his wholesalers to distribute payments or 
administer a promotional program, so long as the supplier takes responsibility . . . for seeing that the allowances are made 
available to all who compete in the resale of his product)."
122,3," Since the issue is standing, and not the substantive scope of §§ 2(d) and 2(e), defendants' reliance on the holdings of F.T.C. v. 
Fred Meyer, Inc., Kirby v. P.R. Mallory & Co., Inc., 489 F.2d 904 (7th Cir.) cert. denied 417 U.S. 911, 41 L. Ed. 2d 215, 94 S. Ct. 
2610 (1974), and L.S.  Amster & Co., Inc. v. McNeil Laboratories, Inc., 504 F. Supp. 617 (S.D.N.Y. 1980) is misplaced. None of 
those decisions squarely address the question of whether a wholesaler has antitrust standing to sue for injuries it sustained as a 
result of the defendants' discrimination among retailers. Moreover, even if the issue had been addressed by Kirby or L.S. 
Amster, the issue would now have to be considered anew in light of recent Supreme Court decisions on antitrust standing, 
discussed infra. "
123,4," Areeda & Turner comment: On balance, we think that HN4[
] [supplier] standing should be denied unless (1) the plaintiff's product is virtually identical 
with that of the defendant, or at least the overwhelming component of the latter in value, and (2) the proximity of interest is 
very clear, as evidenced by the fact that the defendant's actions clearly dictated a substantial market response by the 
plaintiff, and (3) the plaintiff is the injured party whose interest will most likely lead him to vindicate the public interest -- as 
for example, where each immediately-affected dealer is little damaged and can easily shift his attention to other products -- 
and (4) duplicate recoveries can be avoided through a lost-profits measure of damages. Id.  at 213 (emphasis added). "

case. "

191,15," The regulations of the Office of Government Ethics (5 C.F.R. § 737.9(g) provide a pertinent example of conduct not leading to 
disqualification: Example 4: A Senior Justice Department lawyer participated in an antitrust case against Q Company, which is represented 
by Y law firm. Immediately after leaving the Department, she goes to work with Y law firm, and assists at a trial representing 
Q Company in a different antitrust case, not involving the allegations in the Government case. Such assitance would not be 
barred because it does not occur in connection with the same particular matter. "

regulation)."
192,17," Since 1946, the fares for scheduled air transportation on North Atlantic airline routes have been set primarily by government-
approved agreements among members of IATA."
192,18," Defendants quote this language out of context in an effort to link the grand jury investigation to Laker's complaint.  But that 
reference is incidential to the complaint's focus upon the alleged scheme to destroy Laker's Skytrain service.  The complaint 
does not allege a predatory scheme to destroy charters before Skytrain came into existence. "
193,19," Seiden's testimony is particularly credible since he is still employed at the Department of Justice and has no interest in this 
lawsuit. Defendants' suggestion that Seiden's affidavit is not based upon personal knowledge is simply incorrect.  Seiden has 
testified that based upon my familiarity with [the grand jury] proceedings, and from having read the complaint in Laker v. Pan American, 
et al., it is my opinion that the subject of the grand jury investigation is entirely unrelated to the subject matters described in 
the Laker complaint. Seiden affidavit at para. 5."
193,20," Discovery need not be limited to documents or testimony which would be relevant as evidence, but they may include papers 
and testimony which may be expected to lead to such evidence.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1)."
193,21, Defendants make this claim also with regard to a number of other events and proceedings.
193,22," See, e.g., Woods v. Covington County Bank, supra, 537 F.2d at 816; Allied Realty v. Exchange National Bank, supra, 283 F. 
Supp. at 467."
193,23," The cases in which the concern about access to confidential information is discussed and disqualification was granted 
generally involve former prosecutors representing a private client in a civil matter relating to or arising out of the criminal 
prosecution in which he had substantial responsibility.  See Allied Realty v. Exchange National Bank, supra; Hilo Metals Co. v. 
Learner Co., 258 F. Supp. 23 (D. Hawaii 1966)."
193,24," See Flego v. Philips, Appel & Walden, Inc., 514 F. Supp. 1178 (D.N.J. 1981); International Union, UAW v. National Caucus of 
Labor Committees, 466 F. Supp. 564 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd, 607 F.2d 996 (2d Cir. 1979)."
193,25," Defendants repeat over and over that confidential information was supplied to the grand jury (Reply Memorandum at 13 note 
9); they do not focus on the relationship of that material to this lawsuit."
193,26," Cf. Control Data Corp. v. International Business Corp., 318 F. Supp. 145 (D. Minn. 1970). "
194,27," Disqualification would be appropriate if the moving party were able to demonstrate with some degree of persuasiveness that 
the material was indeed confidential and could not have been obtained by other means; that it is material to and has significance 
in the private litigation; and that under the circumstances the former government attorney would be able to use such information 
to the prejudice the moving party."
194,28," The President never acted on the CAB decision.  Three years later, the CAB approved Laker's Skytrain application."
194,29," Moreover, Farmer has testified that he has no recollection that he was at all involved in the review of the 1977 CAB decision.  
This is not overcome by defendants' claim that he must have been involved because he normally participated in such reviews."
194,30," Defendants attempt to link the two matters by observing that the Laker complaint alleges that ""the airline defendants resisted 
Laker's efforts"" to obtain government authority to operate its Skytrain service.  Complaint para. 17 However, there is no 
indication that when the CAB approved Laker's application it was concerned with or investigated such resistence, or that if it did, 
Farmer had any awareness of it.  And defendants do not suggest otherwise."
194,31," Indeed, the decision to grant a permit does not involve ""allegations"" or ""legal issues"" so much as policy considerations.  There 
is considerable doubt therefore whether a policy decision such as this may even be considered a ""matter"" within the terms of the 
Disciplinary Rule. See Part IV infra."
194,32," Defendants complain that Farmer has insight into the reasons generally for CAB and Presidential action or inaction that is 
unavailable to them.  This is too insubstantial a concern.  If a court were disqualify counsel whenever he may have gained 
special insight into governmental deliberations, disqualification of former government attorneys, or indeed former law clerks of 
judges, would become mandatory and routine. "
195,33," In a letter written September 26, 1977 to Chairman Kahn, the President rejected the CAB's proposed order as inconsistent 
with the Administration's foreign economic policy.  He stated that he would consider suspension of these fares in the future 
should the CAB obtain evidence that they were predatory."
195,34," Farmer did not participate in the presentation of the Antitrust Division's position before the CAB.  He was away from 
Washington on vacation from July 29 to August 28, during which time the Department of Justice's pleadings were filed with the 
CAB.  Abbott B. Linsky, Jr., represented the Department at the September 7 oral argument."
195,35," Even if the proof were stronger, it is doubtful that Farmer's participation in the 1977 IATA fare package proceedings and 
decisions could be characterized as substantial enough to meet the requirements of the Disciplinary Rule. ""Participation"" is 
defined to include ""the rendering of advice,"" D.C. Code of Professional Responsibility, Definitions (1983) but that does not mean 
that whenever an individual has been involved in the rendering of advice his participation violates the Disciplinary Rule. The 
advice, like any participation, must have been sufficiently substantial to raise the types of concerns underlying the Rule."
195,36," Farmer affidavit at para. 15; Clarke affidavit exh. 15 (""Jordan memo"") at 7-8."
195,37," Jordan memorandum at 9, App. D; Clarke affidavit at para. 20; Farmer affidavit at paras. 16-19."
195,38," Accordingly, it need not be decided whether these proceedings constitute the same matter as this lawsuit, or whether for the 
purposes of the Disciplinary Rule, they may at all be considered as a ""matter."" "
196,39, The issue of Farmer's personal and substantial participation in the activities cited by defendants is discussed infra.
196,40," To be sure, the Disciplinary Rule would bar counsel from representing a private party in a regulatory or rule-making 
proceeding when he previously participated as a government attorney in the same proceeding. Such a practice of ""switching 
sides"" is the primary target of the Rule.  See note 13 supra. Contrary to defendants' assertion, allegations that defendants 
engaged in predatory pricing do not constitute an attack on the rate-making proceedings held at the CAB during Farmer's tenure 
there such that he may be said to have ""switched sides."" Laker is not litigating CAB approval of defendants' fares or its policies 
concerning deregulation."
196,41," This language is identical to the definition of matter in the comparable provision of the Ethics in Government Act, 18 U.S.C. § 
207."
196,42," B. Manning, Federal Conflict of Interest Law 55 (1964), quoting H.R. Rep. No. 748, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. 20 (1961) (regarding 
the identical definition in federal ethics statute)."
196,43," See 5 C.F.R. § 737.5(c): [A] former Government employee may represent another person in connection with a particular matter involving a specific 
party even if rules or policies which he or she had a role in establishing are involved in the proceeding. "
197,44," These principles also illustrate the irrelevance of Farmer's CAB activities to this lawsuit. The establishment of a framework 
which granted defendants the freedom to engage in price competition is not the same matter as the alleged abuse of that 
freedom in the form of an antitrust conspiracy to establish anti-competitive pricing in order to eliminate a particular competitor."
197,45," Defendants' suggestion that the CAB activities should not be examined separately but as one single ""matter""--the regulation of 
low fares being charged by scheduled carriers--is clearly inappropriate in light of the principle that a matter be ""particular."" See 
note 42 supra. As indicated below, the defendants' broad brush effort obscures rather than illuminates the issues on this motion."
197,46," The CAB reversed its policy on the necessity of entering into these ad hoc agreements in an order issued May 2, 1978."
197,47, These tariffs generally proposed upward seasonal adjustments from the new low fares from the 1977/78 winter season.
197,48, Laker was not among those complaining.
197,49," The CAB ultimately adopted the BDPA's recommended order.  Transatlantic passenger fares, Nos. 31232, etc., C.A.B. Order 
78-5-3 (May 2, 1978)."
197,50, The proposals again generally involved fare increases. 
198,51," The CAB again adopted the BDPA's proposed orders.  Transatlantic fare increases, No. 33276, C.A.B. Order 78-9-38 (August 
23, 1978); Transatlantic fare increases, No. 33622, C.A.B. Order 78-10-61 (October 5, 1978)."
198,52," Moreover, as noted, Farmer was so little involved that he signed one BPDA memorandum before reviewing the matter, and 
another was signed for him by his deputy."
198,53," The North Atlantic Fares Investigation is the obvious exception.  That proceeding, however, was clearly a broad rulemaking 
proceeding and not a ""matter"" under the Disciplinary Rule."
198,54," North Atlantic Fares Investigation, No. 27918, C.A.B. Order 77-10-100 (October 25, 1977)."
198,55," There is also a question as to whether the data is still confidential. Beckman was apparently able to acquire this same 
information through a Freedom of Information Act request.  Thus, if it was related to the issues of this lawsuit, it would be 
discoverable in any event. "
199,56," The report of the chairman of the United States delegation to that conference reveals that the meetings took the form of a 
discussion session and an exchange of views rather than negotiations."
199,57," The incidental reference to an agreement by the United States that its ""aeronautical authorities shall promptly consider [an 
application for renewal of Laker's permit] in accordance with Article 3 of the 1977 Air Services Agreement,"" does not change the 
thrust of the negotiations or the Court's conclusion.  That subject was incidental to the proceedings and not significant to the 
instant lawsuit."
199,58," Defendants once again claim that Farmer had access to confidential information, basing that assertion upon vague statements 
in two affidavits to the effect that ""TWA proprietary information"" was given to U.S. officials during the Bermuda II and U.S.-West 
Germany negotiations. Affidavit of Thomas K. Taylor at para. 4; affidavit of Kenneth L. Briggs at para. 6. Mere exposure to 
proprietary information is a far cry from the concerns and language of the Disciplinary Rule and the case law, particularly where 
the evidence is entirely indeterminate."
199,59, The representation culminated in a telex from the Galland firm to Swissair dated September 1980. 
200,60," This Court has stated that it will grant disqualification ""only upon a showing that the relationship between issues in the prior 
and present cases is 'patently clear ' . . . . [and] when the issues involved have been 'identical ' or 'essentially the same. '""

supra, 478 F.2d at 570-71."
200,63," This case is therefore unlike cases such as Chugach Electric Association v. United States District Court, 370 F.2d 441 (9th 
Cir. 1966), where the attorney appearing for counsel for plaintiff in an antitrust action had been general counsel for defendant. "
201,64," Because of the confidential nature of the materials submitted to the Court, it must necessarily speak in generalities."
201,65, This is particularly true in light of the fact that the CAB never implemented its proposal.
201,66," This analysis is not changed merely because it is through IATA Traffic Conferences that the IATA may agree upon rates, 
subject to CAB approval.  It may of course be possible to imagine circumstances in which the events in question could have 
some factual connection to this case, but that would be true of any event of the past ten years involving the CAB, IATA, or any of 
the defendants.  Disqualifications are not based upon such speculation.  In any event, scrutiny of the documents involved in the 
prior representations makes clear that there are no factual connections to this lawsuit."
201,67," Defendants can do no better in this respect than to claim that Farmer rendered advice ""concerning the scope of . . . . the 
antitrust immunity of [various carriers] provided pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act."" Reply Memorandum at 6."
201,68," Furthermore, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that one of the purposes of the ""substantial relationship"" standard is to 
protect the former client against the use to his detriment of confidential information provided to his former attorney.  The 
correspondence and written instructions requesting advice do not contain, and the advice rendered does not reflect, any 
confidences with any bearing upon this case."
201,69," IATA is not named as a defendant in this lawsuit, and the complaint does not allege that IATA itself played a role in the 
defendants' conspiracy."
201,70," Cf. Duncan v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., supra, 646 F.2d at 1030-31; Moyroud v. Itek Corp., 528 F. Supp. 
707, 708 (S.D. Fla. 1981); Jackson v. J.C. Penney Co., 521 F. Supp. 1032, 1035 (N.D. Ga. 1981). "
202,71, Defendants' Reply at 34 n.35.
202,72," None of these conclusions is altered by defendants' frequent references to discovery requests for information concerning IATA 
meetings and activities.  As indicated above, arguments based upon the scope of discovery are not necessarily persuasive 
grounds upon which to establish that two matters are substantially related. Moreover, defendants' discussions of discovery requests are broad and unspecific.  On one occasion, the Court is referred to 
""some"" 400 pages of deposition testimony, and it is apparently expected either to accept blindly defendants' characterization of 
that testimony or to read through one thousand pages of deposition testimony in search of the unidentified 400 pages.  In any 
event, the Court finds that, even accepting defendants' characterizations of plaintiff's discovery, a substantial relationship has not 
been established."
202,73," Farmer in camera affidavit at paras. 3, 4, 7, 10."
202,74, See note 61 supra.
202,75," It is not the courts' duty to disqualify an attorney whenever a mere possibility exists that one of the canons of professional 
ethics could be violated.  To the contrary; the Court presumes that, as an officer of the Court, each attorney may be depended 
upon to meet his professional and ethical obligations."
202,76," Cf. Fred Weber, Inc. v. Shell Oil Co., 566 F.2d 602, 609 (8th Cir. 1977)."
202,77," Defendants argue that the need for Farmer's disqualification under Canon 4 is reinforced by the concern underlying Canon 9, 
which seeks to protect against the appearance of impropriety.  The case law is clear, however, that an attorney may not be 
disqualified under Canon 9 unless there is a reasonable possibility that some specifically identifiable impropriety actually 
occurred.  Woods v. Covington County Bank, supra, 537 F.2d at 810; see also Board of Education v. Nyquist, supra, 590 F.2d at "
203,1247," . As the Court has found that there is no reason to believe that an impropriety has or will occur, it will not disqualify Farmer 
under Canon 9, whether considered in conjunction with Canon 4 or as an alternative grounds for disqualification."
203,78," See Laker Airways Ltd. v. Pan American World Airways, 559 F. Supp. 1124 (D.D.C. 1983), aff'd, 235 U.S. App. D.C. 207, 731 
F.2d 909 (D.C. Cir. 1984)."
203,79," See, e.g., a separate Opinion issued simultaneously herewith, which describes Lufthansa's performance with respect to 
discovery  of whatever type and for whatever purpose, sometimes by enlisting the support of the foreign governments which own 
or control them, sometimes by almost childish objections (e.g., the refusal to make corporation officials located in New York 
available for deposition in Washington on the ground that they cannot be spared at any time from their duties for the duration of 
the one-hour trip)."
203,80," In their supplementary papers defendants reveal that they are actively investigating (""through Freedom of Information Act 
requests and other means"") the prior government activities of a recent member of the firm of Beckman & Farmer who has begun 
working on this case.  Defendants complain that they ""have been unable to obtain sufficient information to present in appropriate 
detail their concerns about the potential ethical problems"" they claim are raised by that attorney's representation of Laker. "

cited as Mem. Op.). "
212,3," This case principally involves three types of private line services: point-to-point, FX and CCSA.  The District Court described 
these services as follows: Point-to-point private line service, which plaintiffs initially sought authorization to provide, connects two customer locations 
with a dedicated circuit that does not require use of switching systems because the circuit is available to the customer on a 
continuing and exclusive basis.  In contrast, foreign exchange (FX) and common control switching arrangement (CCSA) 
services, which are involved in certain of plaintiffs' interconnection charges, require dedicated intercity circuits, but also 
provide a connection into a switching system, located in a telephone company switching center. Mem. Op. at 855 n. 11 (citations to record omitted).  For a more detailed description of FX and CCSA services, see Mem. Op. at 
986 nn. 191-192. "
213,4," These services comprise local exchange telephone service and long distance service.  The District Court described these 
services as follows: Local exchange telephone service is the ordinary service used in nearly all homes and businesses.  From a technical 
standpoint, it involves a wire connection from the telephone set to a switching system in a nearby telephone company 
switching center that is in turn connected by transmission trunks to switching systems in other switching centers within the 
exchange area. Long distance service operates in a manner similar to local exchange service but typically involves a two-step process in 
which the user first gains access to the local switching system through a dial tone and then requests access to the long 
distance toll switching system (in many cases the exact same switch) by dialing an area code plus the number of the 
telephone the calling party wishes to reach. Mem. Op. at 855 nn.9-10 (citations to transcript omitted). "
214,5," AT & T made competitive price responses both to the Above 890 decision and to the MCI and Specialized Common Carriers 
decisions.  Four months after the Above 890 decision, AT & T filed a new tariff, called Telpak, that offered substantial discounts 
for bundles of 60 channels (Telpak C) or 240 channels (Telpak D).  Telpak was designed to eliminate the incentive for entities to 
construct private microwave systems for their own use where AT & T facilities were available. Similarly, following the Specialized 
Common Carriers decision, AT & T filed a new tariff, called Hi/Lo, that substantially reduced the rate for single-channel lines 
connecting high-density centers, where the specialized common carriers were likely to compete.  Two years later, the FCC found 
Hi/Lo to be unreasonable.  AT & T then filed a replacement tariff, known as the Multi-Schedule Private Line (""MPL"") tariff, that 
similarly offered low rates on high-density routes.  After each of the above tariffs was filed, the FCC suspended the tariff for the 
then maximum period of 90 days.  After that period, each tariff went into effect and remained in effect throughout the lengthy 
FCC investigation of its reasonableness. "
215,6," Most of the testimony in this case was presented in written form.  Only 47 of AT & T's witnesses actually appeared in court.  
See Mem. Op. at 851 n.7. "
216,7," The District Judge expressed his beliefs most prominently in the course of the following discussion of implied antitrust immunity 
in the ""Conclusion"" section of his Memorandum Opinion: Under the controlling decisions of the Supreme Court, it is undisputed that matters subject to a pervasive scheme of public 
utility or common carrier regulation are not subject to the antitrust laws. Pan American World Airways, Inc. v. United States, 
371 U.S. 296, 300-01, 305, 309, 83 S. Ct. 476, 479, 482, 484, 9 L. Ed. 2d 325 (1963); Hughes Tool Co. v. Trans World 
Airlines, Inc., 409 U.S. 363, 387-89, 93 S. Ct. 647, 660, 34 L. Ed. 2d 577 (1973); United States v. Radio Corp. of America, 
358 U.S. 334, 348-49, 79 S. Ct. 457, 465, 3 L. Ed. 2d 354 (1959). Based on the evidence adduced at trial, the Court finds 
that all of the rates and practices of defendants challenged by SPCC in this case are subject to pervasive federal and state 
regulatory control under a public interest standard that is quite different from and inconsistent with the application of the 
antitrust laws. Though this reverses the Court's earlier 1979 ruling on a Motion to Dismiss, it is clear from all of the evidence 
now before this Court with respect to this plaintiff, that every action complained of in this case could have or should have 
been handled by the appropriate regulatory bodies, which responsibility the regulators miserably mishandled or failed to 
handle.  What the FCC actually did over the years was talk about competition (in reality contrived) in order to achieve 
deregulation which has and will be shown to be contrary to the best interests of millions of Americans throughout the 
country and by those outside the profitable big city areas with a resultant loss of service, quality, and higher costs to those 
least able to afford this now essential service.  It is clear that defendants could not make one penny more than what the 
various regulators allowed them.  Indeed, AT & T had a double burden -- not only could their rates not be too low, but 
neither could they be too high.  The states have done a particularly good job in regulating the defendants in order to insure 
the highest quality of service at the lowest possible cost for all of their citizens.  There are many instances in which AT & T 
would seek a rate increase from the state, only to be denied all of it or part of it.  The states were also very effective in 
regulating the interconnection problems as well.  The picture became cloudy on the interconnection matter only because 
the FCC attempted, and quite successfully, to obtain jurisdiction over intrastate matters.  Whether this was in the public 
interest will remain for another day.  The bottom line of ""public interest"" has actually been construed as what some powerful 
interests in this country want as distinguished from what the public can afford, namely, safe, reliable service to everyone 
(instead of creamskimming the big city areas where profits are maximized) at the lowest possible cost to all and particularly 
those least able to afford telecommunications service, which should be our continued standard.  This Court believes that 
the antitrust laws were never intended to destroy an essential public utility such as we have here.  It may be necessary for 
Congress and the Justice Department to re-examine the problems herein discussed and to bring about the return of 
responsible regulation so that there will be no more contrived competition in profitable areas only. This Court believes that 
sound and honest regulation of telecommunications at the federal and state level is our only guarantee of access to this 
necessity throughout the whole country and not just part of it.  Regulation in this area of telecommunications up until the 
1970's at the federal and state levels has served this country well and it is hoped that sometime in the near future it will 
again do its proper job without abdication to the greed of a few, no matter how big or small. It is necessary to mention the FCC again.  It put the Specialized Common Carriers into business for the benefit of a few 
without taking into account the myriad of problems to our people and our national security.  It was the FCC that never found 
TELEPAK (C & D) unlawful for over 20 years, as well as delayed making other very important decisions.  It cannot be 
successfully disputed that whatever the FCC mandated throughout the relevant period of this case, that AT & T was 
obligated to, and did in fact, follow, no matter whether it made any sense in economics or law.  It was primarily the FCC 
staff during this entire period, after permitting the Specialized Common Carriers entry into the market in the name of 
competition (really contrived), whose performance, was, to say the least, totally unprofessional and inadequate by virtue of 
the likes of Messrs. Cox, Hinchman, Tucker, and Scott.  It was a result of their actions (or inaction) as well as a thin majority "
217,," of the Commissioners in the 60's and 70's that has subjected AT & T to many lawsuits in the antitrust field now pending 
today.  Had the FCC not engaged in its usual regulatory lag and dealt forthrightly and properly with the problems as they 
arose, then few, if any, of the cases would now be before the antitrust Courts, such as this one. Mem. Op. at 1095-97 (emphasis in original) (footnotes omitted)."
217,8," SPCC alleged at oral argument that the District Judge also was biased in the sense that he harbored a personal animus 
against SPCC as a party.  See Transcript of Oral Argument at 7-8.  This allegation is based solely on statements the District 
Judge made to the effect that the specialized common carriers as a class were interested only in ""creamskimming the big city 
areas where profits are maximized"" and not in providing ""safe, reliable service to everyone . . . at the lowest possible cost to all 
and particularly those least able to afford telecommunications service."" Mem. Op. at 1096 (emphasis in original); see Transcript 
of Oral Argument at 8.  We do not at all find that these and similar statements manifest a personal animus against SPCC, but 
only that they reflect the District Judge's policy views.  Our review of the trial record provides no support for SPCC's allegation of 
personal animus. Indeed, at the conclusion of the trial, lead counsel for SPCC thanked the District Judge for the ""great deal of 
goodwill toward the parties"" that he had shown ""throughout this case."" Trial Transcript at 6048.  We also find it significant that, 
after several years of pre-trial proceedings, SPCC waived its right to trial by jury to have the case tried before the District Judge, 
and that SPCC never sought to have the District Judge disqualified for personal bias."
217,9," The issue in the present case is whether the appellants were denied a fair trial because of the District Judge's alleged bias, and 
not whether the District Judge should have disqualified himself for bias. HN5[
] Judicial disqualification in the federal courts is governed by two sections of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. §§ 144, 455 (1982).  Section 144 provides in pertinent part: HN6[
] Whenever a party to any proceeding in a district court makes and files a timely and sufficient affidavit that the 
judge before whom the matter is pending has a personal bias or prejudice either against him or in favor of any adverse 
party, such judge shall proceed no further therein, but another judge shall be assigned to hear such proceeding."
217,28," U.S.C. § 144 (1982). Section 455 provides in pertinent part that HN7[
] ""any justice, judge, or magistrate of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned,"" id. § 455(a), and 
""also"" shall disqualify himself ""where he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party,"" id. § 455(b)(1).  These sections 
establish a more stringent standard for disqualification than is required by the right to a fair trial guaranteed by the due process 
clause.  See United States v. Haldeman, 181 U.S. App. D.C. 254, 559 F.2d 31, 130 n.276 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (en banc) (per 
curiam), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 933, 97 S. Ct. 2641, 53 L. Ed. 2d 250 (1977); accord In re IBM Corp., 618 F.2d 923, 932 n. 11 "
218,," (2d Cir. 1980); see also FTC v. Cement Institute, 333 U.S. 683, 702, 92 L. Ed. 1010, 68 S. Ct. 793 (1948) (most matters relating 
to judicial disqualification do not rise to a constitutional level); Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U.S. 510, 523, 71 L. Ed. 749, 47 S. Ct. 437 
(1927) (""All questions of judicial qualification may not involve constitutional validity.  Thus matters of kinship, personal bias, state 
policy, remoteness of interest, would seem generally to be matters merely of legislative discretion."").  Thus, HN8[
] a 
determination that a judge is not disqualified for bias necessarily includes a determination that the right to a fair trial is not 
violated by the judge's presiding over the case."
218,10," Cf.  Laird v. Tatum, 409 U.S. 824, 835, 34 L. Ed. 2d 50, 93 S. Ct. 7, 14 (1972) (Memorandum of Mr. Justice Rehnquist) (""Proof 
that a Justice's mind at the time he joined the Court was a complete tabula rasa in the area of constitutional adjudication would 
be evidence of lack of qualification, not lack of bias.""); In re J. P. Linahan, Inc., 138 F.2d 650, 652 (2d Cir. 1943) (""An 'open 
mind,' in the sense of a mind containing no preconceptions whatever, would be a mind incapable of learning anything, would be 
that of an utterly emotionless human being, corresponding roughly to the psychiatrist's descriptions of the feeble-minded.""). "
219,11, See note 7 supra.
219,12," For a brief description of FX and CCSA, see note 3 supra."
219,13," In its brief and at oral argument, SPCC repeatedly referred to remarks made by the District Judge at a hearing on a post-
judgment motion to the effect that his decision was ""appeal proof"" and would be affirmed.  SPCC would have us believe that 
these remarks indicate that the District Judge deliberately and deviously set about to render a biased decision impervious to 
attack.  SPCC neglected to quote the Judge's remarks in context, however.  At the time the remarks were made, the District 
Judge was urging the parties to settle the case.  The District Judge suggested to SPCC that although its intention to appeal was 
""perfectly proper,"" it would make more sense to settle instead because ""the decision is appeal proof . . . unless the Court of 
Appeals is going to overrule 100 years of law about findings being clearly erroneous . . ., and I don't see how in the world in light "
220,," of this record it could be."" Transcript of Hearing at 112 (Mar. 30, 1983).  We do not find these remarks to be inappropriate in 
context, and we do not read them necessarily to indicate more than that the District Judge believed that his decision fully 
documented a total failure by SPCC to prove its case."
220,14," Thus, for example, a judge who was vehemently opposed to the continuation of the Vietnam War was not disqualified from 
determining whether a draftee had been unlawfully inducted under the selective service laws.  Lawton v. Tarr, 327 F. Supp. 670 
(E.D.N.C. 1971). Similarly, a judge whose Church was opposed to the proposed Equal Rights Amendment and to extension of 
its ratification deadline was not disqualified from determining whether a state legislature may rescind its prior adoption of the 
amendment and whether Congress may extend the ratification period after the time originally designated by Congress had 
elapsed.  Idaho v. Freeman, 478 F. Supp. 33 (D. Idaho 1979)."
220,15," Indeed, the Judge addressed the issue of implied antitrust immunity for the first time in the ""Conclusion"" section of the 
Memorandum Opinion, almost as an afterthought. "
223,16," SPCC argues that many of the District Court's determinations of credibility in the present case were predicated on 
impermissible grounds.  We have considered SPCC's allegations, and conclude that the District Court fully supported each 
determination of credibility critical to its holding on the issue of unlawful maintenance of monopoly power on the basis of 
legitimate considerations, such as demeanor, objectivity, expertise, experience, and the logic of the testimony.  As we have 
already noted, it does not matter that certain of these findings were initially drafted by counsel for AT & T.  What is important is 
that the District Judge adopted these findings as his own, that they have a basis in the record, and that there is nothing to 
suggest that they are clearly erroneous. "
224,17," The closest SPCC comes to arguing that the District Court's findings of fact should be set aside under the ""clearly erroneous"" 
standard is the following: Under the proposed standard of review, it is unnecessary for this Court to even reach the question of how the district court's 
opinion would be reviewed under a clearly erroneous test.  However, even if such a test were applied, we do not concede, 
as AT & T alleges (AT & T Br., p. 23), that any or all of the district court's factfindings should be affirmed. Appellants' Reply Brief at 4 n.4. "
225,18," However, because we do not reach the issues of injury-in-fact and proof of damages, we have not considered the factual 
disputes pertaining to these issues."
225,19," ""HN17[
] Exclusionary"" conduct may be defined as ""conduct, other than competition on the merits or restraints reasonably 
'necessary' to competition on the merits, that reasonably appear capable of making a significant contribution to creating or 
maintaining monopoly power."" 3 P. AREEDA & D. TURNER, ANTITRUST LAW para. 626, at 83 (1978).  The issue is whether 
the defendant's conduct is reasonable in light of its business needs, or whether it unreasonably excludes competition.  See Barry 
Wright Corp. v. ITT Grinnell Corp., 724 F.2d 227, 230 (1st Cir. 1983). "
226,20, See note 5 supra.
226,21," Notwithstanding the District Court's holding on the issue of implied antitrust immunity, the court clearly recognized the 
inadequacy of the regulatory scheme, as implemented by the FCC, to prevent anticompetitive behavior.  Thus, the District Court 
noted that ""every action complained of in this case could have or should have been handled by the appropriate regulatory 
bodies, which responsibility the regulators miserably mishandled or failed to handle."" Mem. Op. at 1096 (footnote omitted) 
(emphasis added).  The District Court further noted that ""it was the FCC that never found TEL-PAK (C & D) unlawful for over 20 
years, as well as delayed making other very important decisions,"" and that ""had the FCC not engaged in its usual regulatory lag 
and dealt forthrightly and properly with the problems as they arose, then few, if any, of the cases would now be before the 
antitrust Courts, such as this one."" Id. at 1097 (emphasis in original). "
227,22," SPCC argues that the relevant market should be defined as the nationwide market for all business and government intercity 
telecommunications services.  Mem. Op. at 871; see Appellants' Opening Brief at 27 n.23.  Given our disposition of this case, we 
need not decide this issue."
227,23, SPCC argues that this finding is overstated. See Appellants' Opening Brief at 27; Appellants' Reply Brief at 19-20. 
228,24," SPCC also argues that the structure of Telpak was anti-competitive even if Telpak was not preditorily priced. The District Court 
rejected SPCC's arguments after full consideration.  See Mem. Op. at 947-53; accord MCI Communications Corp. v. AT & T, 
708 F.2d 1081, 1130-31 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 891, 104 S. Ct. 234, 78 L. Ed. 2d 226 (1983). We agree with the 
District Court's analysis.  We note that the Telpak structure was designed for legitimate business reasons to duplicate the 
economic characteristics of the private microwave systems that large users of AT & T's private line services considered 
constructing for their own use following the FCC's Above 890 decision.  The District Court found after fully reviewing the 
evidence that AT & T continued to maintain and market Telpak throughout the 1960's and 1970's as a competitive alternative to 
private microwave. See Mem. Op. at 953-55.  This finding is supported by the evidence and is not clearly erroneous."

sets in Philadelphia; and all were tuned to the game."" App. 244. "
247,4," The television committee's 1981 briefing book elaborates: ""In 1952, the NCAA Television Committee initiated a plan for controlling the televising of college football games. The plans have 
remained remarkably similar as to their essential features over the past 30 years.  They have had the following primary 
objectives and purposes: ""1. To reduce, insofar as possible, the adverse effects of live television upon football game attendance and, in turn, upon the 
athletic and education programs dependent upon that football attendance; ""2. To spread television among as many NCAA member colleges as possible; and ""3. To provide football television to the public to the extent compatible with the other two objectives."" Ibid."
247,5," Because respondents sought and obtained only injunctive relief against future violations of § 1 in the District Court, we do not 
consider previous NCAA television plans except to the extent that they shed light on the purpose and effect of the current plan."
247,6," ""The purposes of this Plan shall be to reduce, insofar as possible, the adverse effects of live television upon football game 
attendance and, in turn, upon the athletic and related educational programs dependent upon the proceeds therefrom; to spread 
football television participation among as many colleges as practicable; to reflect properly the image of universities as 
educational institutions; to promote college football through the use of television, to advance the overall interests of 
intercollegiate athletics, and to provide college football television to the public to the extent compatible with these other 
objectives."" Id., at 35 (parenthetical omitted)."
247,7," The supplementary series is described in a separate article of the plan.  It is to consist of no more than 36 exposures in each of 
the first two years and no more than 40 exposures in the third and fourth years of the plan.  Those exposures are to be 
scheduled on Saturday evenings or at other times that do not conflict with the principal football series that is scheduled for 
Saturday afternoons.  Id., at 86-92."
247,8," An ""exception"" telecast is permitted in the home team's market of games that are sold out, and in the visiting team's market of 
games played more than 400 miles from the visiting team's campus, but in both cases only if the broadcast would not be shown 
in an area where another college football game is to be played.  Id., at 62-72.  Also, Division II and Division III institutions are 
allowed complete freedom to televise their games, except that the games may not appear on a network of more than five 
stations without the permission of the NCAA.  Id., at 73-74. "
248,9," In addition to its contracts with the carrying networks, the NCAA has contracted with Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. (TBS), 
for the exclusive right to cablecast NCAA football games. The minimum aggregate fee for the initial 2-year period of the TBS 
contract is $ 17,696,000.  546 F.Supp., at 1291-1292."
248,10," The football television committee's briefing book for 1981 recites that a fee of $ 600,000 was paid for each of the 12 national 
games telecast by ABC during the regular fall season and $ 426,779 was paid for each of the 46 regional telecasts in 1980.  
App. 250.  The report further recites: ""Division I members received $ 27,842,185 from 1980 football television revenue, 89.8 
percent of the total.  Division II's share was $ 625,195 (2.0 percent), while Division III received $ 385,195 (1.3 percent) and the 
NCAA $ 2,147,425 (6.9 percent)."" Id., at 251."
248,11," The District Court explained how the agreement eliminates competition for broadcasting rights: ""First, the networks have no intention to engage in bidding.  Second, once the network holding first choice for any given date has 
made its choice and agreed to a rights fee for that game with the two teams involved, the other network is then in a monopsony 
position.  The schools cannot threaten to sell the broadcast rights to any other network. They cannot sell to NBC without 
committing a violation of NCAA rules.  They cannot sell to the network which had first choice over that particular date because, 
again, they would be in violation of NCAA rules, and the network would be in violation of its agreement with NCAA.  Thus, NCAA 
creates a single eligible buyer for the product of all but the two schools selected by the network having first choice.  Free market 
competition is thus destroyed under the new plan."" 546 F.Supp., at 1292-1293. "
249,12," The District Court held that the NCAA had monopolized the relevant market in violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U. S. C.

carrying networks and the threat of sanctions against members for violating NCAA rules could not be considered a boycott if the 
rules were otherwise valid.  707 F.2d, at 1160-1161."
250,14," In the Court of Appeals as well as the District Court, petitioner argued that respondents had suffered no injury of the type the 
antitrust laws were designed to prevent, relying on Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477 (1977). Both 
courts rejected its position, 707 F.2d, at 1150-1152; 546 F.Supp., at 1303-1304. Petitioner does not seek review on that question 
in this Court.  Brief for Petitioner 5, n. 1."
250,15," The Court of Appeals rejected petitioner's position that it should set aside many of the District Court's findings as clearly 
erroneous.  In accord with our usual practice, we must now accord great weight to a finding of fact which has been made by a 
district court and approved by a court of appeals.  See, e. g., Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 623 (1982). In any event, petitioner 
does not now ask us to set aside any of the findings of the District Court, but rather argues only that both the District Court and 
the Court of Appeals erred as a matter of law.  Brief for Petitioner 6, n. 2, 18-19."
250,16," Judge Barrett dissented on the ground that the NCAA television plan's primary purpose was not anticompetitive. ""Rather, it is

fully integrated into academic endeavors."" 707 F.2d, at 1163. He regarded the television restraints as fully justified ""in that they 
are necessary to maintain intercollegiate football as amateur competition."" Id., at 1165. He added: ""The restraints upon 
Oklahoma and Georgia and other colleges and universities with excellent football programs insure that they confine those 
programs within the principles of amateurism so that intercollegiate athletics supplement, rather than inhibit, academic 
achievement."" Id., at 1167."

253,27," ""The Sherman Act was designed to be a comprehensive charter of economic liberty aimed at preserving free and unfettered

allocation of our economic resources, the lowest prices, the highest quality and the greatest material progress, while at the same

253,28," In this connection, it is not without significance that Congress felt the need to grant professional sports an exemption from the 
antitrust laws for joint marketing of television rights.  See 15 U. S. C. §§ 1291-1295.  The legislative history of this exemption 
demonstrates Congress' recognition that agreements among league members to sell television rights in a cooperative fashion "
254,," could run afoul of the Sherman Act, and in particular reflects its awareness of the decision in United States v. National Football 
League, 116 F.Supp. 319 (ED Pa. 1953), which held that an agreement among the teams of the National Football League that 
each team would not permit stations to telecast its games within 75 miles of the home city of another team on a day when that 
team was not playing at home and was televising its game by use of a station within 75 miles of its home city, violated § 1 of the 
Sherman Act. See S. Rep. No. 1087, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. (1961); H. R. Rep. No. 1178, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., 2-3 (1961); 107

254,29," ""It is clear from the evidence that were it not for the NCAA controls, many more college football games would be televised. 
This is particularly true at the local level.  Because of NCAA controls, local stations are often unable to televise games which 
they would like to, even when the games are not being televised at the network level.  The circumstances which would allow so-
called exception telecasts arise infrequently for many schools, and the evidence is clear that local broadcasts of college football 
would occur far more frequently were it not for the NCAA controls.  This is not a surprising result.  Indeed, this horizontal 
agreement to limit the availability of games to potential broadcasters is the very essence of NCAA's agreements with the 
networks. The evidence establishes the fact that the networks are actually paying the large fees because the NCAA agrees to 
limit production.  If the NCAA would not agree to limit production, the networks would not pay so large a fee.  Because NCAA 
limits production, the networks need not fear that their broadcasts will have to compete head-to-head with other college football 
telecasts, either on the other networks or on various local stations.  Therefore, the Court concludes that the membership of 
NCAA has agreed to limit production to a level far below that which would occur in a free market situation."" 546 F.Supp., at 
1294."
254,30," ""Turning to the price paid for the product, it is clear that the NCAA controls utterly destroy free market competition.  NCAA has 
commandeered the rights of its members and sold those rights for a sum certain.  In so doing, it has fixed the minimum, 
maximum and actual price which will be paid to the schools appearing on ABC, CBS and TBS.  NCAA has created the 
mechanism which produces a uniform price for each national telecast, and a uniform price for each regional telecast. Because of 
the NCAA controls, the price which is paid for the right to televise any particular game is responsive neither to the relative quality 
of the teams playing the game nor to viewer preference. ""In a competitive market, each college fielding a football team would be free to sell the right to televise its games for whatever 
price it could get.  The prices would vary for the games, with games between prominent schools drawing a larger price than 
games between less prominent schools.  Games between the more prominent schools would draw a larger audience than other 
games. Advertisers would pay higher rates for commercial time because of the larger audience. The telecaster would then be 
willing to pay larger rights fees due to the increased prices paid by the advertisers.  Thus, the price which the telecaster would 
pay for a particular game would be dependent on the expected size of the viewing audience. Clearly, the NCAA controls grossly 
distort the prices actually paid for an individual game from that to be expected in a free market."" Id., at 1318."
254,31," Since, as the District Court found, NCAA approval is necessary for any institution that wishes to compete in intercollegiate 
sports, the NCAA has a potent tool at its disposal for restraining institutions which require its approval.  See Silver v. New York 
Stock Exchange, 373 U.S. 341, 347-349, and n. 5 (1963); Associated Press v. United States, 326 U.S., at 17-18. "

255,33," ""In this case the rule is violated by a price restraint that tends to provide the same economic rewards to all practitioners 
regardless of their skill, their experience, their training, or their willingness to employ innovative and difficult procedures."" Arizona 
v. Maricopa County Medical Society, 457 U.S., at 348. The District Court provided a vivid example of this system in practice: ""A clear example of the failure of the rights fees paid to respond to market forces occurred in the fall of 1981.  On one weekend 
of that year, Oklahoma was scheduled to play a football game with the University of Southern California.  Both Oklahoma and 
USC have long had outstanding football programs, and indeed, both teams were ranked among the top five teams in the country 
by the wire service polls.  ABC chose to televise the game along with several others on a regional basis.  A game between two 
schools which are not well-known for their football programs, Citadel and Appalachian State, was carried on four of ABC's local 
affiliated stations.  The USC-Oklahoma contest was carried on over 200 stations.  Yet, incredibly, all four of these teams 
received exactly the same amount of money for the right to televise their games."" 546 F.Supp., at 1291."
255,34," As the District Court observed: ""Perhaps the most pernicious aspect is that under the controls, the market is not responsive to viewer preference.  Every witness 
who testified on the matter confirmed that the consumers, the viewers of college football television, receive absolutely no benefit 
from the controls.  Many games for which there is a large viewer demand are kept from the viewers, and many games for which 
there is little if any demand are nonetheless televised."" Id., at 1319."
255,35," Even in the context of professional football, where Congress was willing to pass a limited antitrust exemption, see n. 28, supra, 
it was concerned about ensuring that telecasts not be subject to output limitations: ""Mr. GARY.  On yesterday I had the opportunity of watching three different games. There were three different games on three 
different channels. . . . ""Would this bill prevent them from broadcasting three different games at one time and permit the league to enter into a contract 
so that only one game would be permitted? ""Mr. CELLER.  The bill does not prevent what the gentleman saw yesterday.  As a matter of fact the antitrust exemption provided 
by the bill shall not apply to any package contract which prohibits the person to whom league television rights are sold or 
transferred from televising any game within any area except the home area of a member club on the day when that club is 
playing a home game. . . . . ""Mr. GARY.  I am an avid sports fan.  I follow football, baseball, basketball, and track, and I am very much interested in all 
sports. But I am also interested in the people of the United States being able to see on television the games that are played.  I 
am interested in the television audience. I want to know that they are not going to be prohibited from seeing games that might 
otherwise be telecast. ""Mr. CELLER.  I can assure the gentleman from Virginia that he need have no fears on that score."" 107 Cong. Rec. 20060 
(1961). "
256,36," The impact on competitors is thus analogous to the effect of block booking in the motion picture industry that we concluded 
violated the Sherman Act: ""In the first place, they eliminate the possibility of bidding for films theater by theater.  In that way they eliminate the opportunity 
for the small competitor to obtain the choice first runs, and put a premium on the size of the circuit."" United States v. Paramount 
Pictures, Inc., 334 U.S. 131, 154 (1948)."
256,37," 546 F.Supp., at 1294. One of respondents' economists illustrated the point: ""[It's] my opinion that if a free market operated in the market for intercollegiate television of football, that there would be 
substantially more regional and even more local games being televised than there are currently.  I can take a specific example 
from my home state of Indiana. ""I am at Ball State University, which until recently was a division one-A institution, although now is a division one-AA institution in 
terms of intercollegiate football. When Ball State plays Indiana State, that is a hotly contested game in an intrastate sense.  That 
is a prime example of the type of game that probably would be televised. For example, when Ball State is playing Indiana State 
at Terre Haute, Indiana, that [would be] a popular game to be televised in the Muncie area, and, vice versa, in Terre Haute when 
the game happens to be in Muncie."" App. 506-507. See also id., at 607-608."

256,39," ""The fact that a practice is not categorically unlawful in all or most of its manifestations certainly does not mean that it is 
universally lawful.  For example, joint buying or selling arrangements are not unlawful per se, but a court would not hesitate in 
enjoining a domestic selling arrangement by which, say, Ford and General Motors distributed their automobiles nationally 
through a single selling agent.  Even without a trial, the judge will know that these two large firms are major factors in the 
automobile market, that such joint selling would eliminate important price competition between them, that they are quite 
substantial enough to distribute their products independently, and that one can hardly imagine a pro-competitive justification 
actually probable in fact or strong enough in principle to make this particular joint selling arrangement 'reasonable' under 
Sherman Act § 1.  The essential point is that the rule of reason can sometimes be applied in the twinkling of an eye."" P. Areeda, 
The ""Rule of Reason"" in Antitrust Analysis: General Issues 37-38 (Federal Judicial Center, June 1981) (parenthetical omitted). "
257,40," Moreover, because under the plan member institutions may not compete in terms of price and output, it is manifest that 
significant forms of competition are eliminated.  See Catalano, Inc. v. Target Sales, Inc., 446 U.S., at 648-649 (per curiam);

257,42," The Solicitor General correctly observes: ""There was no need for the respondents to establish monopoly power in any precisely defined market for television programming 
in order to prove the restraint unreasonable.  Both lower courts found not only that NCAA has power over the market for 
intercollegiate sports, but also that in the market for television programming -- no matter how broadly or narrowly the market is 
defined -- the NCAA television restrictions have reduced output, subverted viewer choice, and distorted pricing.  Consequently, 
unless the controls have some countervailing procompetitive justification, they should be deemed unlawful regardless of whether 
petitioner has substantial market power over advertising dollars.  While the 'reasonableness' of a particular alleged restraint 
often depends on the market power of the parties involved, because a judgment about market power is the means by which the 
effects of the conduct on the market place can be assessed, market power is only one test of 'reasonableness.' And where the 
anti-competitive effects of conduct can be ascertained through means short of extensive market analysis, and where no 
countervailing competitive virtues are evident, a lengthy analysis of market power is not necessary."" Brief for United States as

257,47," As the District Court observed, id., at 1297, the most analogous programming in terms of the demographic characteristics of 
its audience is professional football, and as a condition of its limited exemption from the antitrust laws the professional football 
leagues are prohibited from telecasting games at times that conflict with intercollegiate football. See 15 U. S. C. § 1293. "
258,48," We approved of the District Court's reliance on the greater revenue-producing potential and higher television ratings of 
championship events as opposed to other events to support its market definition.  See 358 U.S., at 250-251."
258,49," For the same reasons, it is also apparent that the unique appeal of NCAA football telecasts for viewers means that ""from the 
standpoint of the consumer -- whose interests the statute was especially intended to serve,"" Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist. No. 2 
v. Hyde, 466 U.S., at 15, there can be no doubt that college football constitutes a separate market for which there is no

times each year""), with Broadcast Music, 441 U.S., at 22-23 (footnotes omitted) (""[To] the extent the blanket license is a different 
product, ASCAP is not really a joint sales agency offering the individual goods of many sellers, but is a separate seller offering 
its blanket license, of which the individual compositions are raw material.  ASCAP, in short, made a market in which individual 
composers are inherently unable to compete fully effectively"")."
259,54," Ensuring that individual members of a joint venture are free to increase output has been viewed as central in evaluating the 
competitive character of joint ventures.  See Brodley, Joint Ventures and Antitrust Policy, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 1523, 1550-1552, 
1555-1560 (1982). See also Note, United Charities and the Sherman Act, 91 Yale L. J. 1593 (1982)."
259,55," If the NCAA faced ""interbrand"" competition from available substitutes, then certain forms of collective action might be 
appropriate in order to enhance its ability to compete. See Continental T. V., Inc., 433 U.S., at 54-57. Our conclusion concerning 
the availability of substitutes in Part III, supra, forecloses such a justification in this case, however."
259,56," The NCAA's plan is not even arguably related to a desire to protect live attendance by ensuring that a game is not televised in 
the area where it is to be played.  No cooperative action is necessary for that kind of ""blackout."" The home team can always 
refuse to sell the right to telecast its game to stations in the immediate area.  The NCAA does not now and never has justified its 
television plan by an interest in assisting schools in ""blacking out"" their home games in the areas in which they are played."
259,57," During this period, the NCAA also expressed its concern to Congress in urging it to limit the antitrust exemption professional 
football obtained for telecasting its games to contests not held on Friday or Saturday when such telecasts might interfere with 
attendance at intercollegiate games. See H. R. Rep. No. 1178, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., 3-4 (1961); 107 Cong. Rec. 20060-20061 "

260,58," See 546 F.Supp., at 1295-1296, 1315."
260,59," ""[The] greatest flaw in the NCAA's argument is that it is manifest that the new plan for football television does not limit 
televised football in order to protect gate attendance. The evidence shows that under the new plan, many areas of the country 
will have access to nine hours of college football television on several Saturdays in the coming season.  Because the 'ground 
rules' eliminate head-to-head programming, a full nine hours of college football will have to be shown on television during a nine-
to-twelve hour period on almost every Saturday of the football season in most of the major television markets in the country.  It 
can hardly be said that such a plan is devised in order to protect gate attendance."" Id., at 1296."
260,60," Ironically, to the extent that the NCAA's position has merit, it rests on the assumption that football telecasts are a unique 
product.  If, as the NCAA argues, see supra, at 111-112, all television programming is essentially fungible, it would not be 
possible to protect attendance without banning all television during the hours at which intercollegiate football games are held."
260,61," See Part II, supra."
260,62," It seems unlikely, for example, that there would have been a greater disparity between the football prowess of Ohio State 
University and that of Northwestern University in recent years without the NCAA's television plan.  The District Court found that 
in fact the NCAA has been strikingly unsuccessful if it has indeed attempted to prevent the emergence of a ""power elite"" in "
261,," intercollegiate football. See 546 F.Supp., at 1310-1311. Moreover, the District Court's finding that there would be more local and 
regional telecasts without the NCAA controls means that Northwestern could well have generated more television income in a 
free market than was obtained under the NCAA regime."
261,63," Indeed, the District Court found that the basic reason the television plan has endured is that the NCAA is in effect controlled by 
schools that are not restrained by the plan: ""The plaintiffs and other CFA members attempted to persuade the majority of NCAA members that NCAA had gone far beyond 
its legitimate role in football television. Not surprisingly, none of the CFA proposals were adopted.  Instead the membership 
uniformly adopted the proposals of the NCAA administration which 'legitimized' NCAA's exercises of power.  The result was not 
surprising in light of the makeup of the voting membership.  Of approximately 800 voting members of the NCAA, 500 or so are in 
Divisions II and III and are not subjected to NCAA television controls.  Of the 275 Division I members, only 187 play football, and 
only 135 were members of Division I-A at the time of the January Convention.  Division I-A was made up of the most prominent 
football-playing schools, and those schools account for most of the football games shown on network television. Therefore, of 
some 850 voting members, less than 150 suffer any direct restriction on their right to sell football games to television."" Id., at 
1317."
261,64," Moreover, the District Court found that those schools which would realize increased revenues in a free market would not 
funnel those revenues into their football programs.  See id., at 1310."
261,65," See id., at 1296, 1309-1310."
261,66," See id., at 1284-1285, 1299."
261,67," See Continental T. V., Inc., 433 U.S., at 54-57. See also n. 55, supra. "
262,68," This is true not only for television viewers, but also for athletes.  The District Court's finding that the television exposure of all 
schools would increase in the absence of the NCAA's television plan means that smaller institutions appealing to essentially 
local or regional markets would get more exposure if the plan is enjoined, enhancing their ability to compete for student athletes. "
264,1," Television plans with similar features have been in place since 1951.  The 1951-1953 plans were submitted to the Antitrust 
Division of the Department of Justice for review.  The Department took the matter ""under study,"" App. 284-285, and, until this 
litigation, has apparently never taken the position that the NCAA's television plans were unlawful. "
265,2," This litigation was triggered by the NCAA's response to an attempt by the College Football Association (CFA), an organization 
of the more dominant football-playing schools and conferences, to develop an independent television plan.  To the extent that its 
plan contains features similar to those condemned as anticompetitive by the Court, the CFA may well have antitrust problems of 
its own.  To the extent that they desire continued membership in the NCAA, moreover, participation in a television plan 
developed by the CFA will not exempt football powers like respondents from the many kinds of NCAA controls over television 
appearances that the Court does not purport to invalidate. "

273,****," The  [**11] approach of the Court in Trade Development has been frequently criticized on the grounds that the balancing of 
interests performed by the district court is appropriate only at the sanctions stage of the proceedings, and is not germane to the 
issue of whether an order compelling discovery should be entered. See, e.g., Ohio v. Arthur Andersen & Co., 570 F.2d 1370, 
1372 (10th Cir.), cert. denied 439 U.S. 833, 99 S. Ct. 114, 58 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1978); Note, Discovery of Documents Located 
Abroad in U.S. Antitrust Litigation, 14 Va. J. Int. L. 747, 753 (1974). Since discovery has already been ordered in this case, and 
a motion for sanctions has been filed, this distinction need not be addressed here. "
274,*****," The court in Uranium Antitrust specifically declined to utilize §40 of the Restatement in its analysis, arguing that it is ""simply 
impossible"" to judicially balance the competing national interests of the United States with foreign countries. "
275,******," The Ministry's letter states, in relevant part: "
276,," With respect to the first two parts of the decision of the District Court I inform you, also on behalf of the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, that I refuse exemption in as far as it concerns information in documents--which also includes written answers to 
""interrogatories""--of N. V. Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken which are in the Netherlands since it has not been determined that 
by complying with the request no conflict can occur with public international law or with the material or formal principles of 
the Dutch Competition Law. With respect to the last part of the decision of the District Court it is considered that it concerns behaviour, facts and 
circumstances in and outside  [**22] the United States of America of N. V. Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken, a company 
operating in the Netherlands. With respect to the behaviour mentioned in the preceding paragraph it is also considered that the ""Notices of Deposition"" by 
which the employees concerned of N. V. Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken are summoned to make depositions are not subject 
to any limitation which would mean that information based on documents which are in the Netherlands, belonging to N. V. 
Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken would not be excluded in the making of these depositions. I inform you, also on behalf of my abovementioned colleague, that I also refuse exemption with respect to this part of the 
decision of the American Judge involved viz, the appearance in person in order to answer questions and to give 
depositions, on the same grounds as put forward with respect to the order to produce documents and to answer 
""interrogatories""."
276,*******," Indeed, if N. V. Philips believes the outstanding protective order to be inadequate, the Special Master would be willing to 
consider recommending that the Court require any additional reasonable safeguards suggested by N. V. Philips."
276,********," By its express terms, Article 39 prohibits only ""deliberate"" disclosures. The record of the instant case, in which N. V. Philips 
has filed several briefs and motions in an effort to avoid disclosing the requested information, would appear to strongly refute 
any suggestion that N. V. Philips' disclosure--if such disclosure is hereafter made--was deliberate. "
277,*********," Remington also argues that N. V. Philips has the burden of showing its good faith. Since N. V. Philips is clearly able to 
comply with the Court's discovery order and has consciously decided not to do so, it is proper to place on it the burden of 
demonstrating good faith with respect to its reliance on Article 39. See Societe Internationale v. Rogers, 357 U.S. at 212; United 
States v. Vetco, Inc., 691 F.2d at 1287. Contra, General Atomic Co. v. Exxon Nuclear Co., 90 F.R.D. 290, 296 (S.D. Cal. 1981)."
277,**********," N. V. Philips conten that the tenor of the application is similar to that of an exemption request found to be in good faith in 
In re Westinghouse, supra, 563 F.2d at 999-1000. The request in Westinghouse stated, in part: Rio Algom Corporation, as a result, finds itself in a dilemma. It has no desire to offend the court in Utah, but if it complies 
with the court order in respect to any documents which are subject  [**28] to the Uranium Information Security Regulations, 
then it would be in breach, and would cause individuals in Canada to be in breach of the Regulations. This dilemma could 
be resolved if the Honourable Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources were to consent to the release of the subject 
documents and to the disclosure of the contents of those documents. Rio Algom Corporation, therefore, respectfully requests the consent of the Honourable Minister of Energy, Mines and 
Resources to the release of all documents located in Canada which would respond to the subpoenas and to the disclosure 
or communication of the contents thereof by Mr. George R. Albino or any other officer, director or employee of Rio Algom 
Corporation. A comparison of the two requests for exemption belies N.V. Philips' contention that its request is the equivalent of that approved 
in Westinghouse. "
278,***********," The fact that N. V. Philips asked the Dutch authorities to consider Remington's submissions may be some indicium of its 
good faith. However, given the following footnote from page 9 of the Recommended Ruling dated January 7, 1983, as ordered 
by the Court on January 24, 1983, failure of N. V. Philips to cooperate with Remington would have been clear bad faith: N. V. Philips indicated at oral argument that if discovery were ordered it would seek an exemption from Section 39 from the 
Dutch authorities, and agreed to allow Remington to provide ""some input"" in the application for an exemption from the 
Dutch statute. Since the good faith of N. V. Philips will be an important factor in any decision regarding sanctions, it is in its 
interest to consult with Remington on the application…. "
279,************, The discovery immunity claimed by N. V. Philips could very well lead to de facto antitrust immunity. 
280,*************," Although under certain circumstances an American subsidiary, such as NAPC, may be ordered to produce documents 
controlled by its foreign parent, see Uranium Antitrust Litigation, 480 F. Supp. at 1152-53, and presumably could also be 
sanctioned for failure to comply, the record is insufficient to justify such action against NAPC."
280,**************," Remington claimed this case to a jury on March 8, 1982. "

290,3," A fourth co-defendant, Joseph O'Callahan, is the leading officer of Whiffy's materials cleaning division, located in Mishawaka, 
Indiana.  The materials cleaning division manufactures the products involved in this case and O'Callahan was one of Whiffy's 
principal representatives in the transactions out of which the lawsuit arose.  The trial court dismissed the claims against 
O'Callahan for improper venue. See §§ 4 and 12 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.A. §§ 15 and 22 (1982) (authorizing suits against 
individuals for violations of the antitrust laws ""in the district in which the defendant resides or is found to have an agent""); Braun 
v. Berenson, 432 F.2d 538, 543-44 (5th Cir.1970) (holding that a non-resident officer of the defendant corporation was not 
""found"" in the forum state for purposes of § 4, even though he spent two weeks each year in the forum state on routine corporate 
business). Should the district court determine that it must hear Ladsco's state claims pursuant to our instructions on remand, we find that 
venue was proper against O'Callahan under 28 U.S.C.A. § 1391(b) (1976) HN1[
] (""[a] civil action wherein jurisdiction is not 
founded solely on diversity of citizenship may be brought only in the judicial district where all the defendants reside, or in which 
the claim arose, except as otherwise provided by law"").  The majority of courts considering the joint operation of the venue 
provisions of the Clayton Act and § 1391(b) have held that HN2[
] the Clayton Act's specific venue provisions do not ""abolish or supersede venue provision of § 1391(b)."" First Pullen Commodity Services, Inc. v. A. G. Becker-Kipnis & Co., 507 F. Supp. 
770, 773 (S.D.Fla.1981) (also providing an exhaustive listing of the courts considering this issue).  See generally, C. Wright & A. 
Miller & E. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure: Jurisdiction, § 3818 at 110 (1975).  Because the claims in this case arose in the 
Northern District of Alabama, we consider that venue was properly laid against O'Callahan under § 1391(b) and on remand, if 
the court entertains the unfair competition claims, it should reinstate him as a party. "
291,4," Abrasive shot is a small, rounded steel pellet used in cleaning residue off the molds that foundries use to manufacture various

291,5," Missing from the August 27th meeting was Mr. Bill Ellison, a Ladsco salesman working out of the Birmingham office.  Hester 
and the three salesmen investing in the new venture testified that Ellison had not been approached about the new company 
because they were convinced of his loyalty to Mr. Draper.  Ellison remained with Ladsco following the formation of Hessco."
291,6," The only salesman who left Ladsco and did not join Hessco was Ladsco's salesman in the Carolinas.  Hessco does not sell 
shot in the Carolinas."
291,7," Ladsco's supplier of primary aluminum, Alcoa, did not become a Hessco supplier until early 1980.  Ladsco had been 
purchasing secondary aluminum from the Ladmet division of L. A. Draper & Sons and continued to do so after Hester and the 
other employees left. "
292,8," While pursuing this appeal, Ladsco also filed suit on its unfair competition claims in the Alabama courts.  Relying on Ala.Code § 
6-5-440 (1975), the state trial court dismissed Ladsco's action because this appeal was pending.  The Alabama Supreme Court 
recently affirmed.  The possibility that Ladsco may be unable to reassert its state claims in the Alabama courts is discussed 
more fully in Section II, infra."
292,9," We have already addressed Ladsco's challenge to the dismissal of the defendant O'Callahan for improper venue, supra note 3.  
Ladsco also challenges several of the district court's evidentiary rulings.  We have considered the excluded evidence in 
determining whether the district court properly dismissed Ladsco's claims.  We have determined that Ladsco presented 
insufficient proof to avoid a directed verdict on the antitrust claims, even considering the excluded evidence, and we therefore do 
not address the lower court's specific evidentiary rulings."
292,10," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this court adopted as binding precedent all of the 
decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981.  Id. at 1209. "
294,11," In so holding, the Northwest court expressly rejected the notion that a conspiracy to use unfair means to destroy a competitor 
was a per se violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act. Id. at 90.  Prior to Northwest, a line of cases flowing from the First Circuit 
decision in Albert Pick-Barth Co. v. Mitchell Woodbury Corp., 57 F.2d 96 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 286 U.S. 552, 52 S. Ct. 503, 76 
L. Ed. 1288 (1932), had indicated that a conspiracy to engage in unfair competition was a per se violation of the antitrust laws."
294,12," Following the discussion in Northwest, the Page court broke HN15[
] the rule of reason test down into two parts, under which 
the plaintiff must show: ""(1) a market effect that would be prohibited under the law of mergers; and (2) other conduct by [the] 
defendant that threatens Sherman Act values."" 624 F.2d at 1351. Three findings were relevant to the Page Court's determination 
that the defendant had violated the rule of reason: (1) Associated was the most significant competitor in a concentrated market; 
(2) Page was a potential entrant into the market and its entry by taking over the business of the most significant competitor held 
potential for lessening competition; and (3) the newly created subsidiary had dramatic market power as was evidenced by its 
ability to raise prices and make excessive profits on its installation contracts.  Id. at 1351-53. "
295,13," At oral argument to this court, Ladsco contended for the first time that it had introduced sufficient evidence on each of three 
per se theories to avoid a directed verdict on the antitrust claims.  These theories -- (1) resale price maintenance, (2) tying 
arrangements, and (3) group boycott -- were not included in Ladsco's complaint nor were they part of the amended pretrial order 
in the case.  Ladsco's failure to assert its per se theories of recovery prior to oral argument before this court would generally 
preclude their consideration at this time.  Furthermore, the district court did address these claims in the fashion in which Ladsco 
presented them below and in its briefs to this court.  Ladsco had argued that these three factors contributed to a finding of ""a 
threat to antitrust values"" under the second prong of the Northwest/Page analysis.  See supra note 12.  Viewed in this context, 
the district court properly held that there was insufficient proof on these theories to constitute a ""threat"" to antitrust values, let 
alone a per se violation of the antitrust laws. 560 F. Supp. at 1140-44. Ladsco also argued that Whiffy was guilty of imposing territorial restrictions on Ladsco as a distributor. The district court found 
this allegation lacking in any factual basis.  560 F. Supp. at 1142-43. In addition, territorial restrictions are judged under the rule 
of reason. Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977). Thus, just as 
Ladsco's failure to establish a relevant market defeated its claim under Northwest and Page, absence of proof on the relevant 
market defeated the territorial restrictions allegation as well."
295,14," The importance of the relevant market determination to a rule of reason analysis is illustrated by the Supreme Court decision 
in Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320, 81 S. Ct. 623, 5 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1961). Tampa Electric was a case 
under § 3 of the Clayton Act and involved a requirement contract between the parties.  The coal company defended its breach of 
that contract on grounds that the contract violated the antitrust laws because it imposed an illegal restraint on trade.  Had the 
Court adopted the defendant's argument that the relevant geographic market consisted of Peninsular Florida, the contract at 
issue would have foreclosed 18% of the market.  By broadening the relevant market to include those areas ""to which the 
purchaser[s] [could] practicably turn for supplies,"" id. at 327, 81 S. Ct. at 628, 5 L. Ed. 2d at 587, the market foreclosure dropped 
to less than 1%. In the instant case, without proof of a relevant market, there was no way for the jury to find a market effect that would be 
prohibited by the merger laws.  Therefore, Ladsco could not meet its burden of proof under the first prong of the Northwest/Page 
analysis.  See supra note 12. "
298,15," Contrary to Ladsco's assertion, the mere fact that it competed with Whiffy in the Carolinas is insufficient to establish the 
Carolinas as a relevant market. In support of its assertion, Ladsco cites the general proposition that a relevant market is the 
""area of effective competition."" E.g., Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. at 324, 82 S. Ct. at 1523. However, the concept 
of effective competition in Brown Shoe and other cases that Ladsco cites is not limited to the parties in a given case, but 
encompasses the area in which suppliers of the product can effectively compete and purchasers can turn for supplies.  See, 
e.g., Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. at 327, 81 S. Ct. at 628 (discussing ""area of effective competition"")."
298,16," Indeed, the record indicates that prices in the Carolinas were similar to those in the four-state area.  Whiffy supplied shot for 
the Carolinas and the four-state area from its Virginia plant.  If anything, the record supports an inference that the Carolinas and 
the four states were part of a single market.  Even combining these areas, however, there was insufficient proof to support a 
relevant market definition. "
299,17," The state courts dismissed Ladsco's claim on the authority of Ala.Code § 6-5-440 (1975), which provides: HN24[
] No plaintiff is entitled to prosecute two actions in the courts of this state at the same time for the same cause and 
against the same party.  In such a case, the defendant may require the plaintiff to elect which he will prosecute, if 
commenced simultaneously, and the pendency of the former is a good defense to the latter if commenced at different 
times. The Alabama Supreme Court interpreted the statute to preclude a state action while Ladsco's federal appeal on the same claim 
was pending.  That court, however, did not address the issue of whether a state forum would be available to Ladsco following 
the conclusion of a federal action in which the merits of the state claim were not addressed. "
301,18," Professor Wechsler articulated the rationale underlying this factor of the Gibbs decision as follows: ""Federal courts are not the 
authorized expositors of state law; there is no mechanism by which their errors in such matters can be corrected on appeal by 
state courts."" Wechsler, Federal Jurisdiction and the Revision of the Judicial Code, 13 LAW & CONTEMP. PROB. 216, 232 
(1948) (cited in Gibbs, 383 U.S. at 726 n. 15, 86 S. Ct. at 1139 n. 15). See also Note, UMW v. Gibbs and Pendent Jurisdiction, 
81 HARV.L.REV. 657, 666 (1968) (""A federal court's holding on a novel issue of state law may unduly limit later state 
consideration of the problem; a state court will be hesitant to create a conflict with the federal determination because of possible 
reliance upon that earlier exposition."") The district court found that certification of the general question regarding the parameters of Ladsco's state claims would not be 
efficient or appropriate.  560 F.2d at 1146. However, should the court on remand determine that it must hear the state claims, it 
should consider whether it is feasible to narrow the state law questions sufficiently to certify specific questions to the Alabama 
Supreme Court. "
302,19," With regard to the fourth factor, the pendent state law unfair competition claims were not so closely tied to federal policy as to 
warrant a federal forum for the state claims.  Compare Jackson v. Stinchcomb, 635 F.2d at 473 (state law claims for wrongful 
discharge were pendent to federal claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and involved important questions of federal policy that favored 
litigation in a federal forum).  This factor thus does not point to an abuse of discretion in the district court's dismissal of the state 
claims."
302,20," The district court's failure to account fully for the procedural bar in Ala.Code § 6-5-440 is understandable in light of then-
existing interpretations of that section.  In Terrell v. City of Bessemer, 406 So. 2d 337 (Ala.1981), the Alabama Supreme Court 
held that the section did not apply to prevent a state action if the federal court dismissed pendent state claims.  The Alabama 
court did not clarify Terrell, or the operation of the statute when a federal appeal was pending, until Ladsoc filed its state claim."
302,21," The instant case is distinguishable from Quality Foods de Central America v. Latin American Agribusiness Development 
Corp., 711 F.2d 989 (11th Cir.1983). In Quality Foods, the court ""reluctantly"" remanded to the district court for reconsideration of 
its dismissal of pendent state claims in light of a possible statute of limitations bar.  Id. at 990-91. The court intimated that even if 
the district court found that the state claims were time-barred, it nevertheless might dismiss the pendent claims because the 
statute of limitations issue was not presented to the district court during its initial consideration of the pendent claims and any 
delay in the federal proceedings that may have led to the limitations problem was caused by the plaintiff's recalcitrance. "
303,," Conversely, Ladsco argued to the district court prior to dismissal of the pendent claims that the Alabama courts would not 
consider its state claims should Ladsco pursue its right to appeal the district court's order."
303,22," We place dispositive weight on the availability of a state court action in analyzing the dismissal of the pendent claims, because 
the dismissal, even without the unavailability of a state court action, was an extremely close question.  If a state court action is 
not available, it would be an abuse of discretion to dismiss the pendent claims.  See Henson v. Columbus Bank & Trust Co., 
supra (holding that district court abused its discretion in dismissing pendent claim on facts similar to but weaker than the instant 
facts). "
309,1," For purposes of this appeal, CIL does not contest the fact that it has a monopoly in the TNT market. CIL also does not contest 
the element of anti-competitive intent, but rather argues that even if CIL were found to have had an anti-competitive intent, that 
would not, in the absence of anti-competitive, monopolistic conduct, amount to a violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. "
310,2," In his testimony Arens admitted that Trace X did owe CIL the $ 160,000 for the TNT it had received."
310,3," Trace X Chemical, Inc. v. Gulf Oil Chemical Co., 519 F. Supp. 826 (W. D. Ark. 1982), aff'd, 724 F.2d 68 (8th Cir. 1983)."
310,4," 15 U.S.C. § 13(a) provides as follows: It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, . . . to discriminate in price between different purchasers of 
commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any of the purchases involved in such discrimination are in 
commerce, . . . and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a 
monopoly . . ., or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition. . . ."
310,5," Although the prohibitions of the Robinson-Patman Act are narrower than those contained in section 2 of the Sherman Act, the 
insufficiency of evidence precludes a finding of violation under both Acts. "
311,6," In Agrashell, Inc. v. Hammons Products Co., 479 F.2d 269, 285 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1022, 38 L. Ed. 2d 313, 94 S. 
Ct. 445 (1973), this Court indicated a hesitancy to infer anti-competitive intent solely from the hearsay testimony of an interested 
witness."
311,7," Due to our resolution of the case on the ground of insufficiency of evidence as a matter of law, we do not reach the other issues 
on which CIL appealed. "
322,1," The damage award was broken down as follows: San Antonio Adjusters: $ 271,000 Wakely:"

322,2," The court's order reads: ""Having considered Defendant's Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict, Plaintiffs' response 
thereto and the argument of counsel, as well as the evidence presented at trial hereof, the Court finds that said motion should be 
granted for the reasons set forth in Defendant's brief in support thereof."" We have many times disapproved the use of such brief, unilluminating orders granting judgment in complex cases.  Most 
recently, in Myers v. Gulf Oil Corp., 731 F.2d 281, 283 (5th Cir.1984), we described an order almost identical to this one as being "
323,," ""pithy to the point of being incomplete,"" and we vacated a summary judgment so that the district judge could provide us with an 
adequate statement of reasons for his action.  Such a statement by the trial court is essential to effective review.  Id. at 284; Jot-
Em-Down Store (JEDS) Inc. v. Cotter & Co., 651 F.2d 245, 247 (5th Cir.1981). Here, though practical concerns persuade us to review and decide this case, we are left guessing about the district court's 
reason for granting judgment n.o.v.  Did the district court conclude that plaintiffs failed to prove prima facie unlawful pricing? that 
they failed to prove dangerous likelihood of success? that they failed to prove fact of injury, or amount of damages, or 
causation?  Perhaps Agency prevailed on all these issues; because the district court has said only that it adopts the arguments 
in Agency's post-verdict brief, we are effectively forced to assume that such is the case. We are, of course, sympathetic to the trial court's limited resources -- especially time -- in the face of a heavy caseload.  A 
lengthy opinion is not always required, and arguments may be incorporated from the parties' briefs if they are specifically recited 
rather than adopted en masse.  In the final analysis, however, it is the trial court's exercise of judgment that we review, and in a 
case such as this one we must see more evidence of that judgment than a boilerplate order if we in turn are to perform our 
function effectively."
323,3," In their initial appellate brief, plaintiffs argued that Agency's motion for judgment n.o.v. should not have been entertained by the 
trial judge because Agency allegedly did not make an adequate motion for directed verdict at the close of all the evidence as 
prescribed by Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b).  Agency, moved for directed verdict at the close of the plaintiffs' evidence, laying out the 
various grounds on which it thought it was then entitled to judgment.  At the close of the defendant's case, Agency briefly 
reurged its motion for directed verdict, incorporating the grounds urged in its initial motion. Since plaintiffs' original brief was filed, this court has decided two cases involving similar contentions about allegedly insufficient 
motions for directed verdicts.  Bohrer v. Hanes Corp., 715 F.2d 213 (5th Cir.1983), cert. denied,    U.S.   , 104 S. Ct. 1284, 79 L. 
Ed. 2d 687 (1984); Elliott v. Group Medical & Surgical Service, 714 F.2d 556 (5th Cir.1983). In both cases we rejected a rigid 
application of Rule 50(b), holding that if the court and counsel were adequately informed of the defendant's challenge to the 
sufficiency of plaintiff's evidence a motion for judgment n.o.v. could thereafter be entertained.  Bohrer and Elliott control this 
case; the trial judge properly considered Agency's motion for judgment n.o.v."
323,4," Although variable costs and marginal costs will differ at some points along the production possibilities curve, we note simply 
that, so long as marginal cost did not significantly exceed average variable cost during the relevant time, any difference is not 
germane to our analysis. "
325,5," Sister circuits have also weighed the merits of Areeda and Turner's economic analysis of predation. Although all have accepted 
the basic premises of the Areeda and Turner formulation, most have expressed some reservations about supplanting entirely the 
intent-based test, and none have adopted a per se cost-based test.  Of particular interest are the discussions in MCI 
Communications Corp. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 708 F.2d 1081 (7th Cir.), cert. denied,    U.S.   , 104 S. Ct. 234, 78 L. Ed. 2d

Cir.1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 943, 102 S. Ct. 1483, 71 L. Ed. 2d 654 (1982). A helpful overview of the caselaw in this area is

less comprehensive discussion of the caselaw accompanies an interesting and thought-provoking synopsis of the principal 
alternative theories of predatory pricing advanced in the legal and economic literature in Calvani & Lynch, Predatory Pricing 
under the Robinson-Patman and Sherman Acts: An Introduction, 51 Antitrust L.J. 375 (1983)."
325,6," We recognize that a cost which is regarded as fixed in the short-run may become variable in the long-run, as, for example, 
when durable goods wear out and are either replaced or not.  In most cases, however, we think it will be obvious to judges and 
juries which costs are appropriately viewed as fixed and which as variable over the relevant time period.  When a legitimate 
dispute arises as to the characterization of certain costs, the question is one of fact to be resolved by the jury.  See William 
Inglis & Sons Baking Co. v. ITT Continental Baking Co., 668 F.2d at 1036-38. "
326,7," The record does suggest that Agency did not share plaintiffs' misapprehension: THE COURT: * * * Mr. Tondre [plaintiffs' counsel] says they relied on these admissions and even after this [defense] expert 
was tendered, I mean, the expert negated the admissions at least insofar as certain months were concerned.  He came up 
and said the average variable cost was exceeded by these prices. MR. BICKERTON [defendant's counsel]: Which was never any response -- there was never any interrogatory.  They have 
never asked us about costs, your Honor.  I think that is the point in this case, and if you look at American Excelsior, it is not 
whether you make a profit or loss.  It is the cost.  Cost is the test in a predatory price increase [sic] case. Agency made the same point in another exchange: MR. BICKERTON: We are not changing the admission. THE COURT: You are modifying it or explaining it, right?  You are saying it ain't so. MR. BICKERTON: We are saying we agree that we lost money -- you know, frankly, he didn't couch the question properly: 
Did you have a net loss? Net loss is not even a relevant issue in a predatory pricing case.  Below cost or above cost, that is 
the issue . . . ."
326,8," Thus, the following exchange occurred on direct examination of Agency's expert: Q.  Can a firm charge a price still above its average variable cost and still sustain a net loss in the period that you 
mentioned? "
327,," A.  Can a firm charge a price above the average variable price [sic] and yet still maintain a net loss? Q.  For the period? A.  Yes. Q.  Is it true, that the term ""average variable cost"" and whether you are above or below average variable cost doesn't 
necessarily have anything to do with whether or not you are making a net profit or loss? A.  I would expect that if you are above average variable cost but below average total cost, you might be sustaining a loss. Q.  Talking about different concepts? A.  That's right. Earlier in the trial Agency's chairman had also revealed a businessman's instinctive grasp of this concept: Q.  Pursuant to court procedures, pursuant to what is called a request for admissions, [Agency] has admitted that during the 
time Agency was charging $7.00 and $8.00 in San Antonio and Austin, it was losing money in those offices.  That is the 
state of the record. A.  Sir, we could be charging $50 per car when we first open and still lose money."
327,9," Nor, given the essentially fungible character of the product and the relatively low plant investment, is it surprising that there is 
no suggestion that marginal cost ever exceeded average variable cost."
327,10," Sensitive to the stricture that when a judgment n.o.v. is sought the evidence must be viewed ""in the light and with all 
reasonable inferences most favorable to the party opposed to the motion,"" Boeing Co. v. Shipman, 411 F.2d at 374, we set out 
some of the exchanges at trial that underlie our conclusion.  Most direct was the testimony of Agency's expert: Q.  Do you have an opinion as to whether or not any company could have charged a monopoly [price] in the replacement 
car rental business?"
327,*," * * * * * A.  In my opinion no company could have established a monopoly in San Antonio in the auto replacement rental business 
at that time. Q.  Why is that? A.  Primarily, there are no barriers to entry.  Should a company be able to, even for a short period of time, exclude 
competition and raise their prices to an unusual profit, the market would be flooded by competitors to compete away any 
monopoly profits.  There are so low barriers to entry into the business from what I can learn that there could be no 
monopoly in that industry. "
328,," A jury question would have been presented, of course, if plaintiffs' evidence had been to the contrary.  Instead, plaintiffs' expert 
effectively endorsed the defense expert's assessment: Q.  Do you remember we had some discussion about replacement[?] Didn't you tell me in the deposition it was your 
perception that it would be easy for the daily car companies, the Hertz and Avises to get into the business whether or not 
they are in it at this time?  You said that? A.  I think it would be easy for me to get in it.  I guess it obviously would be easy for them. Q.  I think you also indicated it would be easy for the new car dealers to get into the business whether or not they were in it 
at this time? A.  That is correct. Even more damaging to plaintiffs' case were the admissions made by the founder and president of Adjusters: Q.  Essentially, all it takes to be in the replacement car business or the insurance rental business is cars and an office and 
a decision to be involved in that business, isn't that true? A.  And some knowledge. Q.  Some knowledge.  Wouldn't you assume that Hertz or Avis or any existing car rental company would have at least as 
much about the replacement car rental business as you did when you started the business? A.  Yes, but they would want to specialize. Q.  So, you would agree with me, then, would you not, that there is a possible ready transition by the Hertzes and the 
Avises into the insurance rental business even to a larger extent than they are now? A.  Yes. Q.  And isn't there also another source of competition in the replacement car insurance rental business, that being the car 
dealers? A.  Some car dealers."
328,*," * * * * * Q.  If the new car dealer made the decision to get into the replacement car business in San Antonio, all it would take would 
be the decision to do it and acquiring the knowledge? A.  It is the same as in any business. Q.  Is there any reason to think they couldn't develop a fantastic business within a year just like you did? A.  No."
328,*," * * * * * Q.  And we also know that regardless of how many actual competitors there are for this business, there are a whole lot of 
potential competitors, isn't that true[?] A.  There is a lot of potential, yes. "

defendant challenging, among other things, the joint ticket offered by the parties.  Exhibit X, III App.  The suit was settled by 
entry of a consent decree on August 19, 1977, which permitted the continued marketing of the joint ticket for a period of five 
years subject to certain restrictions.  Exhibit 26, III App. Defendant argued that apprehension over continued scrutiny by the Attorney General of Colorado under the consent decree was 
one of the factors which led it to discontinue the joint ticket after plaintiff refused to accept 12.5% as its share of revenues.  I 
App. 121.  On appeal, defendant's position is that ""even if it abandoned the joint ticket as a conscious and unequivocal refusal to

355,9," In its brief, defendant quotes the following passage from plaintiff's closing argument: The evidence has also shown that the Aspen Skiing Corporation, Buttermilk Skiing Corporation, and Snowmass Skiing 
Corporation together used that power to deliberately exclude Highlands from a substantial portion of the destination skier 
visits beginning in the 1977-'78 season by doing six things: (1) Imposing a condition that revenue must be divided on the 
four-area ticket based upon a fixed percentage substantially below the Aspen Highlands' market share previously realized, 
and to do so, to force Aspen Highlands out of the four area ticket; [2] as part of that, substituting their own three-area, six-
day ticket which was provided in place of the four-area ticket and also provided for revenues being divided on the basis of 
usage; (3) marketing and advertising the Aspen resort in such a manner as to convince the newcomer to Aspen that Aspen 
only had three mountains rather than four mountains; (4) entering into special agreements with ARI, Aspen Reservations, 
Inc., the tour operator, for the purpose of inducing ARI, to sell Aspen Skiing Corporation tickets to the exclusion of Aspen 
Highlands' tickets; (5) refusing to accept Aspen Highlands Adventure Pack coupons during the '78-'79 season, again 
making it more difficult for Aspen Highlands to compete in the Aspen market; and (6) using their power to raise the 
individual daily lift ticket price this last year to $22, to completely eliminate Aspen Highlands' ability to offer a multi-area 
ticket in the Aspen market. See Brief of Defendant-Appellant, Cross-Appellee, at 41; XIII R. 2214-15. "
356,10," We are mindful that one of the damage years was 1977-78, and that a four-area ticket was offered in that year.  We discuss 
the antitrust injury attributable to this year in infra Part III."
356,11," Defendant relies on Areeda & Turner, who state that ""in general, the monopolist is under no duty to help his rivals enter, 
survive, or expand."" 3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law para. 738m, at 286 (1978).  Defendant says that while an exception 
must be made for bottleneck cases where through vertical integration a firm has come to monopolize or control a component 
essential for a rival's survival, the ""so-called 'bottleneck' cases are inapplicable here, however, because there is no claim that 
[defendant] is vertically integrated, or that it is the sole supplier of some component without which [plaintiff] absolutely cannot 
bring its product (here, service) to the market."" Brief of Defendant-Appellant, Cross-Appellee, at 44-45 n.32.  We reject 
defendant's argument. We are not convinced that the essential touchstone of bottleneck cases is vertical integration.  See, e.g., P. Areeda & D. Turner, 
Antitrust Law para. 728b4, at 231 (1978) (""Of course, the nonintegrated monopolist. An integrated monopolist cannot engage in 
refusals to deal tending unreasonably to exclude actual or potential rivals from his monopoly market.""); L. Sullivan, Handbook of 
the Law of Antitrust § 48, at 131 (1977) (""As a matter of policy, to require the monopolist [with a natural advantage monopoly, but 
without a vertical link to the customer level] to treat all like firms in the same way -- to have, one might say, a rational and 
relevant basis for any distinctions it may make -- is to protect vertically related and adjacent markets from being distorted 
because of arbitrary decisions by the monopolist.""). We decline to adopt a narrow rule that would immunize an unintegrated monopolist from antitrust liability for refusing a 
competitor access to an essential facility in these circumstances.  Vertical integration is not essential to finding a violation of the 
antitrust laws for a refusal to deal under the intent test.  See, e.g., Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, 342 U.S. 143, 96 L. Ed. 
162, 72 S. Ct. 181 (1951). We believe that it is also apparent that no bright line can be drawn between the bottleneck and intent 
cases.  See infra note 13.  Given this, and the need for a fact sensitive inquiry in this area, e.g., Byars v. Bluff City News, Inc., 
609 F.2d 843, 860 (6th Cir. 1980) (courts should ""carefully analyze[] the fact situation before them to see whether defendants' 
conduct was anti-competitive . . . in a case where there is a unilateral refusal-to-deal by a monopolist""), we conclude in the 
circumstances of this case that the bottleneck doctrine is applicable."
356,12," HN11[
] There are two elements to the offense of monopolization under § 2 of the Sherman Act.  The first is ""the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market."" The second is ""the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished 
from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident."" United States v. 
Grinnell, Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-71, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778, 86 S. Ct. 1698 (1966); see also MCI Communications v. AT & T, 708 
F.2d 1081, 1106 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 891, 104 S. Ct. 234, 78 L. Ed. 2d 226 (1983); Berkey Photo, Inc. v. Eastman

fact of injury and damages suffered by reason of a violation of the antitrust laws must also be shown for a private litigant to 
recover on a claim of monopolization. E.g., Central National Bank v. Rainbolt, 720 F.2d 1183, 1187 (10th Cir. 1983). The 
essentials of these elements were covered by the trial court's instructions.  XIV R. 2304. Defendant's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence assumes, arguendo, that Aspen is the relevant market and that 
defendant had monopoly power in that market.  See Brief of Defendant-Appellant, Cross-Appellee, at 40.  Reply Brief of 
Defendant-Appellant, Cross-Appellee, at 7 n.3 (defendant's ""appeal does not present any issue as to the sufficiency of [the] "
357,," evidence"" on ""the jury's findings on market definition""). Thus, the first element under Grinnell necessary to establish a § 2 
violation is not at issue."
357,13," The overlap of the essential facilities doctrine and the intent test is ""apparent upon examination of Otter Tail Power Co. v. 
United States, 410 U.S. 366, 93 S. Ct. 1022, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1973)."" Byars, supra, 609 F.2d at 857. In Otter Tail, the 
defendant was a vertically integrated power company.  It had the capacity to produce power and transmit it over its own lines to 
municipalities, where it could sell the power at retail prices.  When municipalities sought to replace the defendant at the retail 
level, defendant refused to sell power to the municipalities. Relying on both the intent test and the bottleneck theory, the district court found that this refusal to deal violated the antitrust 
laws.  United States v. Otter Tail Power Co., 331 F. Supp. 54, 61 (D. Minn. 1971). The Supreme Court in its brief analysis did not 
distinguish between the two theories.  Otter Tail, supra, 410 U.S. at 377-79; see also Byars, supra, 609 F.2d at 857. The Court 
held that the district court's finding ""that Otter Tail's refusal to sell at wholesale or to wheel were solely to prevent municipal 
power systems from eroding its monopolistic position"" was supported.  Otter Tail, supra, 410 U.S. at 378. For other cases discussing a duty to deal but not distinguishing between the essential facilities doctrine and the intent test, see, 
e.g., Home Placement Service v. Providence Journal Co., 682 F.2d 274, 281 (1st Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1028, 103 S. 
Ct. 1279, 75 L. Ed. 2d 500 (1983); Mid-Texas Communications, Inc. v. AT & T, 615 F.2d 1372, 1387-88 & n.12 (5th Cir.) (""While 
in theory there exist differences between the two approaches, in practice the theories are similar.""), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 912,

357,14," Only general intent, not specific intent, is necessary to a finding of a § 2 violation of monopolization. See Times-Picayune 
Publishing Co. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 626, 97 L. Ed. 1277, 73 S. Ct. 872 (1953); United States v. Griffith, 334 U.S. 100, 
105-06, 92 L. Ed. 1236, 68 S. Ct. 941 (1948). But see Byars v. Bluff City News Co., Inc., supra, 609 F.2d at 859. ""While the 
completed offense of monopolization under § 2 demands only a general intent to do the act, 'for no monopolist monopolizes 
unconscious of what he is doing,' a specific intent to destroy competition or build monopoly is essential to guilt for the mere 
attempt now charged."" Times-Picayune Co., supra, 345 U.S. at 626. "
358,15," Defendant relies on Telex Corp. v. IBM, 510 F.2d 894, 926 (10th Cir.) (per curiam), cert. dismissed, 423 U.S. 802, 96 S. Ct. 8, 
46 L. Ed. 2d 244 (1975), for the proposition that its marketing of a three-mountain ticket was one of the ""ordinary marketing 
methods available to all in the market,"" and therefore could not violate § 2 of the Sherman Act.  Brief of Defendant-Appellant, 
Cross-Appellee, at 48. We need not decide that it was or would be illegal to offer a three-mountain ticket in competition with the four-mountain ticket. 
We believe that all of the evidence should be examined together, and we do not consider defendant's marketing of a three-area 
ticket in isolation from its other conduct.  See infra note 18."
358,16," Defendant argues that ""the verdict cannot be construed as based on a finding that [defendant's] refusal to cooperate was 
intended, or was motivated by a purpose or desire, to achieve or maintain monopoly power"" because the trial court ""instructed 
the jury that no such finding was necessary."" Brief of Defendant-Appellant, Cross-Appellee, at 47 n.34.  We must reject 
defendant's argument. "
359,," There was no proper or timely objection to the formulation of the intent instruction, as required by Rule 51.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 51. 
Moreover, the charge correctly stated that ""willfully as used in these instructions means acting knowingly and deliberately, but it 
does not mean that [defendant] must have specifically intended to achieve or maintain monopoly power."" XIV R. 2310.  Under § 
2 general intent is all that is required to support a monopolization claim; only for a mere attempt to monopolize is specific intent 
required to be shown.  E.g., Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 626, 97 L. Ed. 1277, 73 S. Ct. 872 
(1953); United States v. Griffith, 334 U.S. 100, 105-06, 92 L. Ed. 1236, 68 S. Ct. 941 (1948); Home Placement Service v.

instructing the jury as to the elements of the offense of monopolization, not an attempt to monopolize, and she properly 
instructed that specific intent was not an element of that offense."
359,17," The trial judge's charge referred to the duty to cooperate with a business rival and said that a refusal to deal with a competitor 
""does not violate Section 2 if valid business reasons exist for that refusal."" XIV R. 2311."
359,18," Defendant argues that each of the ""six things"" on which plaintiff relied to demonstrate that it was deliberately excluded from 
the destination skier market must be supported by sufficient evidence to support a § 2 verdict.  See supra note 9.  Defendant 
reasons that if we ""uphold[] the legal sufficiency and proof of one or more, but not all, of [plaintiff's] theories, then [defendant] is 
entitled to a new trial."" Brief of Defendant-Appellant, Cross-Appellee, at 59-60. Defendant relies on Northeastern Telephone Co. v. AT & T, 651 F.2d 76 (2d Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 943, 102 S. Ct. 
1438, 71 L. Ed. 2d 654 (1982) for the above proposition.  In Northeastern, the Second Circuit reversed and held that plaintiff 
failed to prove five of the six types of conduct it alleged were anti-competitive.  Because the interrogatories submitted to the jury 
did not permit the court to determine whether the jury based its damage award on any of the five types of conduct that plaintiff 
had failed to prove were anti-competitive, the Second Circuit remanded for a new trial. We cannot agree that each one of the ""six 
things"" which plaintiff argued demonstrated abuse of monopoly power, taken alone, must be supported by sufficient evidence to 
find a § 2 violation.  We reach this conclusion for two reasons. First, defendant's argument would require that we view each of the ""six things"" in isolation.  To do this, however, would be 
contrary to the Supreme Court's admonition that an antitrust plaintiff ""should be given the full benefit of [its] proof without tightly 
compartmentalizing the various factual components and wiping the slate clean after scrutiny of each."" Continental Ore Co. v. 
Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 699, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777, 82 S. Ct. 1404 (1962); see also Associated Press v. United 
States, supra, 326 U.S. at 14; Northeastern Telephone v. AT & T, supra, 651 F.2d at 95 n.28 (recognizing rule in Continental 
Ore but distinguishing it where proof was ""utterly lacking"" in ""numerous critical respects""); Case- Swayne Co. v. Sunkist 
Growers, Inc., 369 F.2d 449, 459 (9th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 387 U.S. 932, 18 L. Ed. 2d 994, 87 S. Ct. 2056, rev'd on other 
grounds, 389 U.S. 384, 19 L. Ed. 2d 621, 88 S. Ct. 528 (1967); GVF Cannery, Inc. v. California Tomato Growers Association, 
Inc., 511 F. Supp. 711, 716 (N.D. Cal. 1981). Plaintiff's evidence should be viewed as a whole.  Each of the ""six things"" viewed 
in isolation need not be supported by sufficient evidence to amount to a § 2 violation.  It is enough that taken together they are 
sufficient to prove the monopolization claim. "
360,," Second, defendant never objected to the instructions that required the jury to consider the evidence as a whole.  XIV R. 2295 
(jury instruction); XIV R. 2290-92 (defendant's objections to instructions).  In fact, the trial judge instructed that the plaintiff is ""not 
required to prove every one of its allegations about anti-competitive conduct. Once again, you have a problem for judgment, for 
thorough and sensitive weighing of the evidence."" XIV R. 2213-14.  Moreover, defendant did not submit more specific 
interrogatories that would have required the jury to make the grounds for its decision clear. I R. 143-45 (defendant's special 
interrogatories on monopolization).  In these circumstances, we should uphold the general verdict if the proof on various theories 
is sufficient to sustain the general verdict.  See, e.g., Union Pacific Railroad Co. v. Lumbert, 401 F.2d 699, 701 (10th Cir. 1968) 
(absent pertinent objection to charge or request for specific interrogatory, a general verdict is upheld where there is substantial 
evidence supporting any ground of recovery in favor of an appellee); see also Malandris v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & 
Smith Inc., 703 F.2d 1152, 1176-77 n.20 (10th Cir. 1981), (en banc) (plurality opinion), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 824, 104 S. Ct. 
92, 78 L. Ed. 2d 99 (1983); Comins v. Scrivener, 214 F.2d 810, 814 (10th Cir. 1954). In the instant case, we hold that there is 
sufficient evidence to find that defendant had a duty to cooperate in marketing a four-mountain ticket, and that its refusal to do 
so, considered together with its other acts, supported the finding of monopolization."
360,19," Plaintiff's expert was Ted Farwell of Boulder, Colorado.  Mr. Farwell was a ski area planner, consultant and appraiser, with a 
bachelor's and master's degree in business administration, and 20 years' experience in his field.  VIII R. 1163.  He was a former 
competitive skier himself, skiing for the University of Denver, and on three United States Olympic teams. Id. at 1170. "
361,20," There was evidence that plaintiff's mountain was of equivalent desirability to defendant's mountains. There was testimony that 
plaintiff's mountain was ""the finest, well-balanced mountain in the Aspen area."" IV R. 502.  One witness testified that he 
""prefer[ed] [plaintiff's mountain] as a ski area,"" and that he recommended plaintiff's ski school over the others because it is a 
""friendly area."" VII R. 983; see also id. at 985-86.  There was also testimony from a member of defendant's board of directors 
that if a four-mountain ticket had been offered in 1978-79, defendant would not have marketed its three-mountain ticket at the 
same time.  Exhibit 33, III App.; V R. 585."
361,21," Defendant also argues that Farwell's projections ""were attributed at least in part to what the trial court found to be [defendant's] 
lawful competition -- its offering of its own 3-area ticket."" Brief of Defendant-Appellant, Cross-Appellee, at 66 (emphasis in 
original).  Defendant argues that the judgment must be reversed because, as in Coleman Motor Co. v. Chrysler Corp., 525 F.2d 
1338 (3d Cir. 1975), plaintiff's expert relied on defendant's lawful conduct in projecting damages.  We disagree for two reasons. First, we have explained above that we must look at the evidence as a whole in determining whether defendant violated § 2.  
Whatever the propriety of marketing its own three-day ticket in other circumstances, we must conclude that defendant cannot 
complain of Farwell's reliance on its offering of the three-day ticket in conjunction with the other evidence of monopolization in 
this case, especially where defendant has acquiesced in the jury's return of a general verdict.  ""But however innocent such 
agreements might be, standing alone, they would assume quite a different aspect if utilized as essential features of a program to 
hamper or destroy competition."" Associated Press, supra, 326 U.S. at 14. Second, Farwell's projections do not assume that the three-day ticket is illegal.  Instead, the projections merely assume that 
defendant would refrain from offering the three-day ticket. As we have explained earlier, there is support in the record for this 
assumption.  See supra note 20."
361,22," Defendant makes a broad challenge to the admission of the testimony of plaintiff's expert.  In addition to the challenge that the 
testimony was inadmissible because grounded on false assumptions, which we have rejected, defendant also argues that even 
if the expert evidence was otherwise admissible it should have been excluded as misleading and confusing. See Fed.R.Evid. 
403.  Brief of Defendant-Appellant Cross-Appellee at 68.  We note that under Rule 403, Fed.R.Evid., the ""task of balancing the 
probative value of evidence against danger of confusion of the issues is one for which the trial judge because of his [or her] 
familiarity with the full array of evidence in the case, is particularly suited."" Rigby v. Beech Aircraft Co., 548 F.2d 288, 293 (10th 
Cir. 1977). We will not disturb the trial court's decision on this issue unless it is an abuse of discretion.  See, e.g., Whiteley v. 
OKC Corp., 719 F.2d 1051, 1057 (10th Cir. 1983); Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. v. Marine Office-Appleton & Cox Corp., 
579 F.2d 561, 567 (10th Cir. 1978); Rigby v. Beech Aircraft Co., 548 F.2d 288, 293 (10th Cir. 1977). We cannot say it was an 
abuse of discretion to refuse to exclude the expert's testimony under Rule 403. "
364,23," Defendant criticizes Farwell's damage estimate for 1977-78 on the ground that the four-mountain ticket was actually offered 
during this year, contrary to the apparent assumption of Exhibit 101.  However, this defect is not fatal to the verdict when we 
consider the amount of damages attributed to this year in comparison with the other damage years.  Under his more 
conservative Method B, Farwell attributed between $884,400 and $991,300 in damages for each of the years 1978-79 through 
1980-81, during which the four-mountain ticket was not offered.  The total damages attributed by Farwell to these three years 
was over $2.8 million, which was greater than the jury's damage award for the four damage years in question.  Farwell's 
estimate of $354,300 in damages for 1977-78, during which the four-mountain ticket was offered, therefore should be viewed in 
light of Farwell's estimated damages for 1978-79 through 1980-81 and the actual damages awarded by the jury.  See Midwest 
Underground Storage, Inc., supra, 717 F.2d at 501 (upholding jury damages award that was ""within the range of the evidence""). "
369,*," Judge Garza, now a senior judge of this circuit, is participating as a member of the panel that initially considered the appeal 
now subject to en banc review."
369,**, Judges Randall and Garwood did not participate in this decision. 
370,1, Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 1181 (Vernon 1963) and the Charter of the city of Houston provided for this procedure.
370,2," Gulf Coast is a limited partnership that operates solely in the cable television business.  After its unsuccessful bid for a 
franchise in the city of Houston in 1972, Gulf Coast remained in business and obtained franchises for a number of small cities 
within the Houston Metropolitan area. "
371,3, Doctor Sadowski never evaluated Affiliated's application because it was submitted after his employment had been terminated.
371,4," Shortly before the City Council considered the franchise ordinances, the Public Service Director submitted a letter to the City 
Attorney to the effect that he lacked the information necessary to judge the merits of each application.  In relevant part, the letter 
concluded that ""while these issues may have been considered by the drafting principals, and may have been addressed 
satisfactorily by them, I have no way of knowing this."" Record on Appeal, vol. 14, at 616.  The ""drafting principals"" were later 
identified as the attorneys for certain franchise applicants. "
372,5," In response to defendant's motion, plaintiff cited a wealth of evidence to demonstrate a second theory of conspiracy. In its 
memorandum opinion the court set out all the evidence which it agreed would support a second theory of conspiracy to limit 
competition: By late August 1978, Clive Runnells, on behalf of Gulf Coast, had agreed with Meca that they would be friendly competitors. 
Testimony of Clive Runnells.  Al Levin, Affiliated Capital's lawyer during the franchising process, testified that by September 20, 
1978, he contacted Bill Chamberlain, an agent of Gulf Coast.  Chamberlain told him that Gulf Coast's attorney Bill Olson ""was a 
pushing force of the cable TV situation at that point."" Levin further testified that he then contacted Olson and Olson told him, ""as "
373,," far as I am concerned, Al, it's too late; the pie has already been cut."" On the day before this telephone conversation between 
Levin and Olson, Olson had told Jonathan Day, an attorney for Houston Cable, that Olson was ""trying to put a map together"" 
and that ""most of the areas are defined on eastern side."" Plaintiff's exhibit 63. On September 28, 1978, a lawyer for Houston Cable wrote to the lawyer for Gulf Coast regarding the franchise ordinance: Enclosed is a copy of the proposed cable television ordinance marked to show deletions and additions, including some 
recommended by our FCC counsel.  Also enclosed is an unmarked copy for your convenience. The enclosed form of the proposed ordinance has been placed in our word processing equipment.  Consequently, any 
changes or additions you wish to make can be easily accommodated.  As we discussed, the enclosed form should be 
considered as an internal working draft so that we can reach an agreed proposal to present to the city. Plaintiff's exhibit 14.  A week later he wrote another letter recounting that they had met on this franchise ordinance, and noting 
their discussions of various provisions of this proposed ordinance, including the provision with respect to the percentage of the 
City's interest in the gross revenues from the ordinances: Enclosed is a revised form of CATV ordinance with the changes we discussed at our last meeting in Section 8.G; Section 
10.B; Section 12.H, J, and M; and Section 23.A. Also enclosed is a suggested revision to Section 20.A regarding the three percent of gross revenue issue in the event we 
are unsuccessful in limiting the franchise fee to regular subscriber service. If you have further comments or suggestions regarding this proposed form of ordinance, please let me know. Plaintiff's exhibit 15.  None of the referenced sections of the proposed ordinance relates to boundaries. In October 1978, Runnells and others met with Mayor McConn.  At that meeting, Runnells was informed that McConn wanted 
Westland to have a franchise. Westland had applied for a portion of the area sought by Gulf Coast, and the Mayor indicated to 
Gulf Coast that a general area, Westbury-Meyerland, was what he wanted Westland to have.  Testimony of Clive Runnells; 
Testimony of James McConn. On November 22, 1978, notice of the November 29th City Council agenda indicated that six (6) ordinances, five of which 
ultimately were approved, would be considered.  On November 27, 1978, the attorney for Houston Cable, one of the applicants 
scheduled on the upcoming agenda, sent a final proposed cable television ordinance to the City Attorney: Enclosed is a revised form of the proposed cable t.v. ordinance which includes the modifications made this week-end. In order to meet the proposed time schedule, any further revisions must be agreed by 12 noon on Tuesday, November 28.  
Final proofing of the enclosure will be completed by that time. Plaintiff's exhibit 29.  He also sent a copy of the ordinance to Gulf Coast's attorney, who had discussed it with the lead counsel 
for Houston Cable earlier that morning: Enclosed is the proposed cable t.v. ordinance which Jonathan Day discussed with you this morning.  Also enclosed is a 
copy of the transmittal letter to the City attorney. I have marked significant changes in red in order to facilitate your review.  If you have any questions or comments, please 
let me know. Plaintiff's exhibit 30.  The next day Houston Cable's attorney sent copies of the ordinances to the ultimately successful 
applicants.  The proposed ordinances were complete except for the names of the applicants and their proposed service area. 
Plaintiff's exhibits 32 & 189.  The successful applicants then filled in the blanks with their names and service areas, and 
forwarded the ordinances to the City Attorney.  Some applicants sent their proposed ordinances back to the Houston Cable 
Attorney who then forwarded them to the City.  Plaintiff's exhibit 35. The agenda for the City Council meeting of November 29, 1978 contained six (6) cable television franchises, not including 
plaintiff's, Plaintiff's exhibit 33; those ordinances had been placed on the agenda on or before November 22, 1978, Plaintiff's 
exhibit 174.  When Affiliated attorney Levin heard of this, he contacted Assistant City Attorney Adrian Baer.  Baer relayed the 
following information to Levin: The Mayor and City Council had made their decision, and [Baer] said, 'I learned this directly from the Mayor, the franchises 
are non-exclusive, he does not know about the areas, it's still being worked out by Williams and Baer . . . so the net result 
will be a de facto exclusive.' "
374,," He [,Baer,] explained to me that there were -- the decisions as to who was going to get what areas, specifically in terms of 
the actual boundaries, were still under negotiations, but the decision as to who was fait accompli. Testimony of Al Levin; Plaintiff's exhibit 106. After an on-site inspection of Gulf Coast's Bellaire facilities, Sadowski, the consultant hired by the City of Houston, told Earle, 
Director of Public Service, and Baer, Assistant City Attorney, that he would reject Gulf Coast's application.  The next morning, 
Sadowski was fired.  One day later a messenger from Earle retrieved the notes Sadowski had made concerning the applications.  
In his notes, Sadowski had not recommended that Gulf Coast's application be rejected, in spite of his oral suggestion to that 
effect to Earle and Baer, and he testified that he would have made no substantive changes in his report after the visit to Gulf 
Coast's facilities.  He had recommended in his report, however, that Gulf Coast be given a smaller franchise area than that for 
which it had applied.  When Sadowski's notes were typed by someone with the City, that recommendation was deleted. 
Moreover, other significant changes were reflected in the typed version of the notes Sadowski had turned over to Earle's 
messenger: his recommendations that Houston Community Cable, Houston Cable, and Columbia (Westland) be rejected were 
changed to recommendations that they should continue to be considered; and his statement that Cablecom had presented the 
only satisfactory application was omitted.  Testimony of Robert Sadowski. Prior to the plaintiff's hearing before City Council on December 12, 1978, McConn suggested to Goldberg that Affiliated seek a 
franchise in another area of the City rather than in the area sought by Gulf Coast.  McConn testified as to his motivation for the 
suggestion: ""I thought that, in trying to really help Mr. Goldberg, it was pretty obvious to me that Gulf Coast had the muscle and 
that Mr. Goldberg did not."" At the City Council hearing on plaintiff's application which was conducted on December 12, 1978, the following comments were 
made by Councilman Goyen: Mr. Goldberg, let me address Council's wisdom.  As these applications came in, they were sent to the Legal Department.  
Obviously, a number of lawyers got together and did whatever they did.  I was not privy to it nor did I want to sit in on any 
meeting. Apparently, they came up with the formula that those applicants agreed upon.  I was hoping that your situation might end 
up in the same pot as the others, whereby there would be some kind of recommendation coming before this Council, and 
this Council would not have to carve from one to give to another, which we have not had to do in the past and which I do 
not want to do now nor do I intend to. I do not want to taketh away and giveth to somebody else, because I haven't had to do that in the past.  You have a very 
competent attorney, and the other people have very competent attorneys.  What I would like to see done, and it might take 
a motion to get this done, is to send this to the Legal Department and try to work something out. Plaintiff's exhibit 150, at 27-28.  Subsequently, the Council discussed how to proceed with plaintiff's application, and Councilman 
Mann made the following suggestions: I want to make a substitute motion that the [plaintiff's] application be referred to the Legal Department, and they in turn can 
contact these other applicants who have come forward and see if they can work out something. . . . . If you take this, fine, then see how much Gulf Coast is going to knock off this other group on farther down and then around 
and around. . . . . Substitute motion that this application be referred to the Legal Department and Public Service, and they are to contact the 
other people that have ordinances and guarantee that these boundaries are being adjusted between them, and they report 
back to Council. Plaintiff's exhibit 150, at 37, 39, 40. Also at that hearing, Mann indicated his knowledge of a house-count survey that had been conducted by Gulf Coast.  Plaintiff's 
exhibit 150, at 25.  The survey resulted in a comparison between the area plaintiff was applying for and an area that was within 
Houston Cable's application, Plaintiff's exhibit 84, and was conducted in conjunction with a proposal by Gulf Coast, that if 
Houston Cable would give the identified area to Gulf Coast, then Gulf Coast would be willing to give plaintiff its area.  Testimony 
of Al Levin.  A document, prepared sometime between November 28, 1978, and December 20, 1978, by Assistant City Attorney "
375,," Baer bears an alternative boundary description for the Gulf Coast franchise including the Houston Cable area, with Baer's 
notation: ""I-10 line shifted to Hwy. 290 without Goldberg's tract -- contingency."" Plaintiff's exhibit 56. The City Council favored Gulf Coast's franchise, which subsumed the area plaintiff had applied for, and at trial several 
councilmen and Mayor McConn testified as to their reasons therefor.  McConn's concern was to keep politically influential groups 
content: Q.  You didn't want to step on anybody's political toes, did you? A Not if I could avoid it. Q You didn't want to make any type of political decision where some powerful person like Walter Mischer would be 
unhappy, did you? A Not if I could avoid it. Q And if all of the parties could work things out, then you wouldn't have to make any type of decision, other than approving 
their agreements, isn't that correct? A Yes, generally that is correct, yes, sir. Q And isn't that what you wanted to happen? A That would have been beautiful, if it could have happened that way. Q But when it didn't happen and you had to make the choice between Southwest Houston and Gulf Coast, you stated that 
the other -- you thought the other people were more politically powerful than Southwest, isn't that correct? A Yes, sir.  I don't know if I said that, but I'll say it now.  Testimony of James McConn. Councilman Goyen testified by deposition that he would have voted for Affiliated Capital's application if ""on the 20th, Mr. 
Goldberg had come in and Mr. Runnells had come in, Mr. Mishcher had come in, and all the principals had come, and a 
piece of Houston had been carved out for Mr. Goldberg with no objection by anybody."" Councilman Robinson testified that 
he would have supported Affiliated Capital's application if plaintiff had been able to work something out with Gulf Coast to 
give him what he wanted.  Councilman Westmoreland testified that he did not disagree with his prior deposition testimony 
that Affiliated had been unable to work out any type of arrangement with Gulf Coast, and for that reason Westmoreland 
voted in favor of Gulf Coast. Finally, plaintiff's expert witness, Martin Malarkey, testified at length about the detrimental results of the noncompetitive 
franchising process in Houston, and about the benefits to residents of other cities where the process has involved 
competition on the merits of the applications.  According to his testimony, the benefits include lower rates, provisions for 
sanctions in the event of noncompliance by the franchisee, provisions for performance bonds, and provisions requiring city 
approval prior to changes in ownership or control of the franchises. Further, he testified that normally the city itself prepares 
the franchise ordinance, rather than allowing applicants to do so. "
375,519, F. Supp. at 1000-05 (footnotes omitted). 
379,6," Indeed, if the instruction was anything but neutral it was favorable to the defendants.  It provided: Defendant Gulf Coast claims that the agreements with Houston Cable and Westland to divide or allocate territories within which 
certain applicants would apply for a franchise constituted an exercise of Gulf Coast's right to petition government and therefore 
falls outside the scope of the Sherman Act. The Constitution ensures the right of all persons, whether acting individually or in 
concert, to petition government for political action, recognizing that persons in the exercise of these constitutional rights naturally 
will petition government for political action that is favorable to their particular interests and unfavorable to the interests of others.  
The Supreme Court has declared that this right to petition government for political action is paramount, and that the concerted 
effort of various parties genuinely to influence public officials does not in any way violate the antitrust laws regardless of intent or 
purpose. Joint efforts truly intended to influence public officials to take official action do not violate antitrust laws even though the 
efforts are intended to eliminate competition, unless one or more of the public officials involved was also a participant in the 
illegal arrangement or conspiracy. Accordingly, you must determine whether any City official participated in the alleged conspiracy, as that term is defined in this 
Charge.  You may not infer that any member of the City Council or the Mayor was participating in or acting in furtherance of a 
conspiracy simply because that person accepted or agreed with a position urged by an applicant.  A public official's 
communications with a constituent, even if that official thereby is influenced to favor the constituent, is within the parameters of 
the legislative process, and cannot violate the antitrust laws so long as the officials' activities are not the product of an illegal 
arrangement. Also you must determine whether the petitioning activities of the defendants Gulf Coast, Clive Runnells or Jack Trotter were 
genuine attempts to influence public officials with regard to political action. The petitioning activity must be genuine.  Protection does not extend to purported petitioning that is in fact a mere sham to cover 
what actually is nothing more than an attempt to interfere directly with the business of a competitor. That is, protection does not 
extend to activities that are merely a pretext for inflicting on plaintiff an injury not caused by any government action. Thus, if you should conclude from your review of the evidence that defendants City of Houston and Mayor McConn did not 
participate in any illegal agreement or conspiracy and that defendants Gulf Coast, Runnells and Trotter did nothing more in his 
case than meet with other franchise applicants and with City officials for the purpose of persuading the City to award them a 
cable television franchise on some basis, and in furtherance of that objective they reached boundary agreements with the 
Houston Cable and Westland groups, then you may not find that these defendants violated the antitrust laws. Even if you believe "
380,," that the purpose or the necessary effect of meetings attended by Gulf Coast or its representatives was to exclude plaintiff from 
obtaining a franchise, you may not find that the defendants were guilty of a conspiracy in restraint of trade if you believe that the 
defendants' conduct genuinely was aimed toward influencing the City to take favorable action toward them in granting a 
franchise. On the other hand, if you find that the activity was not really an attempt to influence an official to take official action, 
but was nothing more than a sham -- an attempt to interfere directly with the business of a competitor, you may consider those 
actions and any reasonable inferences you may draw from those actions in determining whether defendants engaged in a 
conspiracy in violation of the antitrust laws. The burden of proof with regard to this instruction is on the defendants.  They must prove by a preponderance of the credible 
evidence that the petitioning activities were genuine. "
381,7," ""The Supreme Court has long held that no immunity exists for actions outside the sphere of legitimate legislative activity."" 
Espanola Way Corp. v. Meyerson, 690 F.2d 827, 829 (11th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1039, 103 S. Ct. 1431, 75 L. Ed. 
2d 791 (1983). Although McConn's votes at the City Council meetings and some of his other activities were part of the legislative 
process, he also undertook substantial acts outside of his legislative capacity, which were neither legitimate nor in furtherance of 
his legislative duties.  Mayor McConn participated in and promoted an illegal conspiracy, and intervened several times to apply 
pressure on Affiliated and the conspirators, doing so outside of his legislative capacity. The Mayor testified that the franchise process was conducted in an open, public forum.  The Public Service Department 
prepared a questionnaire for all applicants and hired a consultant to evaluate the applications.  The public was thus lead to 
believe that there would be competition on the merits for the franchises, even if the competitors drew the particular boundary 
lines.  The city's expert criticized the application process, determined that only two applicants were qualified, and that three 
applicants, including Westland, should be rejected. The Mayor did not adhere to the publicly announced program of granting franchises on the basis of critical evaluation.  Instead, 
the franchise ordinance was drafted by the conspirators, the expert was fired, his report doctored, and the City Council's decision 
was made solely on the basis of who participated in the conspiracy. The Mayor did not publicly reveal that to repay a personal debt he had intervened to guarantee a franchise for his lawyer.  He 
never announced that the city's expert had been fired because his recommendations were contrary to the design of the 
conspiracy. He did not inform the public that the expert's report had been altered to make the conspirators' applications appear 
qualified and meritorious. He never admitted that the information in the applications was not a factor in the decision-making 
process.  These facts and others belie the contention that the Mayor's acts were part of a legitimate legislative process.  As 
Judge Bue noted, the City was ""vigorous[ly] involve[d] in orchestrating certain aspects of the conspiracy"" and the Mayor 
""directed"" some of the activities of the conspirators as ""an active co-conspirator not content merely to accede to the wishes of 
private parties."" 519 F. Supp. at 1014, 1016. The illegitimate nature of the Mayor's actions explains why the jury found Runnells 
(Gulf Coast's attorney) and Trotter (financier) innocent, yet held McConn guilty -- despite a generous Noerr-Pennington 
instruction. "
382,8," In July and August of 1978, Houston began taking applications for franchises. In October the city hired an expert and in 
November the plaintiff applied for a franchise. On November 29, 1978, the city ordinances were tabled and the plaintiff was 
granted a hearing on its application.  On December 12, 1978, the plaintiff made its presentation and all applications were 
thereafter referred to the Public Service Department for evaluation.  On January 10, 1979, the final franchises were awarded. "
383,1," Regardless, the jury could have inferred from the evidence that the city and the defendant applicants agreed that no other 
applicant would be considered without their permission.  It is difficult to defend action as being that of city government, with all 
the weight such ought to carry, when the decisionmaking is placed in the hands of private potential competitors. "
384,2," Given the procedural posture of this case, the parties do not attack the jury instruction regarding rule of reason. Regardless, 
how the rule is actually applied gives it meaning apart from its traditional phrasing. "
392,1," Although plaintiffs are technically subfranchisees, they will be referred to as franchisees except where the context requires 
otherwise. "
393,2," The Ninth Circuit often transforms the per se rule into one of presumptive illegality. See, e.g., Moore v. Jas. H. Matthews & Co., 
550 F.2d 1207, 1213 (9th Cir. 1977) (""the presumptive illegality of tie-ins""); Roberts v. Elaine Powers Figure Salons, Inc., 708 
F.2d 1476, 1479 (9th Cir. 1983) (tying arrangements ""presumptively unlawful"" if certain elements exist). But see Digidyne v. Data 
General Corp., 734 F.2d 1336 (9th Cir. 1984) (referring to per se illegality). There is, however, no discernible distinction between 
that rule and the per se rule. The difference in terminology arises from the opportunity the Ninth Circuit affords a defendant to 
justify an otherwise illegal tie. See, e.g., Moore, supra. "
394,3," This may be what the Court had in mind when it stated: Similarly, when a purchaser is ""forced"" to buy a product he would not have otherwise bought even from another seller in the 
tied product market, there can be no adverse impact on competition because no portion of the market which would 
otherwise have been available to other sellers has been foreclosed."

394,4," ""Easy labels do not always supply ready answers."" Broadcast Music, Inc. v. CBS, 441 U.S. 1, 8, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1, 99 S. Ct. 1551 
(1979). The Third Circuit has expressed a similar concern: We are genuinely concerned that the law of tying is becoming a kind of semantic shell game, resting more on key words 
than on careful analysis.  For that reason, we feel compelled to take a pragmatic and prudential, as well as jurisprudential, 
view of the problem before us, taking into our perspective both the nature of the franchising industry and the effects which 
may be perceived to flow from the decision under review. Ungar v. Dunkin' Donuts of America, Inc., 531 F.2d 1211, 1222 (3d Cir.), cert.  denied, 429 U.S. 823, 97 S. Ct. 74, 50 L. Ed. 2d 
84 (1976)."
394,5," There are compelling reasons against imposing on franchisors the uncertainty and risk of presumptive illegality inherent in 
courts' reliance on arbitrary labels. It is doubtful that a franchise agreement requiring franchisees to purchase certain products 
from the franchisor is so ""plainly anticompetitive"" or ""lacking in redeeming virtue"" as to warrant presumptive condemnation 
unless it can be fitted into the distribution system category. See Broadcast Music, supra note 4, 441 U.S. at 8 (blanket licenses 
of musical composition not unlawful per se). Courts have recognized that tying may serve legitimate, procompetitive purposes, see, e.g., Fortner II, supra, 429 U.S. at 619, 
n.10. It may for example, create certain production economies, see, e.g., Principe v. McDonald's Corp., 631 F.2d 303 (4th Cir. 
1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 970, 68 L. Ed. 2d 349, 101 S. Ct. 2047 (1981), cited in Roberts, 708 F.2d at 1482; ensure quality 
control and consumer good-will, see, e.g., California Glazed Products; Krehl, 664 F.2d at 1353-54; and protect nascent 
industries, see United States v. Jerrold Electronics Corp., 187 F. Supp. 545 (E.D. Pa. 1960), aff'd, 365 U.S. 567, 5 L. Ed. 2d 
806, 81 S. Ct. 755 (1961). Moreover, courts and commentators agree that franchising itself enhances the ability of small businesses to compete effectively. 
See GTE Sylvania v. Continental TV, Inc., 537 F.2d 980, 999-1000 (9th Cir. 1976), aff'd, 433 U.S. 36, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 
2549 (1977). Other attributes often credited to franchising are that it tends to promote competition by expanding the number of 
sales outlets and creating efficiencies of production and distribution otherwise unattainable. It facilitates market entry by small "
395,," enterprises with little start-up capital. It retards the tendency toward vertical integration. It facilitates quality control and protection 
of franchisors' goodwill. And it promotes the development of innovative production techniques and expertise. See Note, A 
Clarification and Reformulation of Prevailing Approaches to Product Separability in Franchise Tie-In Sales, 67 Minn. L. Rev. 
1165, 1173-75 (1983); Note, A New Approach to the Legality of Franchising Tie-Ins, 129 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1267, 1276-77 (1981). 
Thus, disincentives to the use of franchise arrangements created by the threat of per se or presumptive illegality dependent on 
vague and conclusory characterizations may affect the economy adversely."
395,6," The Fourth Circuit used a somewhat analogous approach to reach the same result in Principe, supra note 6, 631 F.2d at 309, 
which held a license to use McDonald's trademark and food preparation system inseparable from the required leasing of 
particular store premises: Given the realities of modern franchising, we think the proper inquiry is not whether the allegedly tied products are 
associated in the public mind with the franchisor's trademark, but whether they are integral components of the business 
method being franchised. Where the challenged aggregation is an essential ingredient of the franchised system's formula 
for success, there is but a single product and no tie-in exists as a matter of law."
395,7," In the absence of disputed material facts, the issue of separateness is properly decided on summary judgment. See Krehl, 
supra; Hamro, supra. Cf.  California Glazed Products, supra."
395,8," The analysis of tying agreements has at times been muddled by the injection of an additional requirement that plaintiff prove 
""coercion."" In Moore, supra, for example, the court held that ""there must be some modicum of coercion shown,"" 550 F.2d at 
1216. It went on to find that the necessary coercion could be inferred from a showing than an appreciable number of buyers had 
accepted burdensome terms and defendant possessed sufficient economic power in the tying product. See also, Hirsh v. 
Martindale-Hubbell, Inc., 674 F.2d 1343, 1347 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 973, 74 L. Ed. 2d 285, 103 S. Ct. 305 (1982). "
396,," The Supreme Court in Hyde has made it clear that coercion, i.e. forcing, is simply a manifestation of market power."
396,9," Application of the ""forcing"" concept confronts courts with a dilemma. Obviously a seller must have some degree of leverage or 
power to require buyers to accept the condition of having to purchase the tied product: if buyers always purchased the product 
voluntarily, the condition would be unnecessary. But if that leverage or power alone suffices to establish the presence of forcing 
and thus to evoke the per se rule, then every tying agreement would ipso facto be illegal per se. Such a result is clearly not what 
Hyde or earlier Supreme Court decisions intended. First, in the absence of a degree of market power sufficient to raise an issue 
under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, a tying agreement, from the perspective of a defendant's competitor, is tantamount to a 
requirements contract subject to scrutiny under the rule of reason, 104 S. Ct. at 1568 n.51. From the buyer's point of view, the tie 
resembles a non-price vertical restraint subject to the rule of reason under GTE Sylvania, supra note 5. Second, had the Court 
intended otherwise, the analysis in Hyde of competitive conditions in the tying product market would have been superfluous. At base, ""forcing"" a buyer to accept a tie-in does not differ from ""forcing"" him to pay a particular purchase price. The seller simply 
takes part of the price for the tying product in the form of forced purchases of the tied product. To the buyer, the controlling 
consideration remains the aggregate price of the package. The anti-tying prohibition is aimed not at such market devices in 
general but at the unlawful use of market power to unreasonably restrain trade or to monopolize. As the Court stated in Hyde, Of course, the Sherman Act does not prohibit ""tying,"" it prohibits ""contracts . . . in restraint of trade."" Thus, in a sense the 
question of whether this case involves ""tying"" is beside the point. The legality of petitioners' conduct depends on its 
competitive consequences, not whether it can be labeled ""tying."" If the competitive consequences of this arrangement are 
not those to which the per se rule is addressed, then it should not be condemned irrespective of its label."
396,104, S. Ct. at 1563 n.34. 
397,10," It is important to note that Data General was an action brought by a competing seller, not by a customer as is the case here. 
The appropriate market analysis will not necessarily be the same in both types of cases. See also the discussion in parts IV and 
V, below. "
398,11," See also Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752,     52 U.S.L.W. 4821, 4831 n.19, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 
104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984): ""Market power is the ability to raise prices above those that would be charged in a competitive market."""
398,12," Compare R. S. Markovits, Tie-Ins and Reciprocity: A Functional, Legal, and Policy Analysis, 58 Tex. L. Rev. 1363, 1378-81 
(1980), with R.  Posner, Exclusionary Practices and the Antitrust Laws, 41 U.Chi.L.Rev. 506, 508-15 (1974). "
399,13," Tying arrangements may, for example, enable a franchisor to obtain more efficiently accountings of the volume of its 
franchisees' business. See also note 5, supra. "
400,14," The damage requirement may differ, of course, depending on whether plaintiff is a buyer forced to purchase the tied product 
or a competitor allegedly foreclosed from the tied product market. See Ungar, supra note 4, 531 F.2d at 1221, n. 7a."
400,15," The Supreme Court has at least suggested its accordance with this analysis. In United States Steel Corp. v. Fortner Enters., 
Inc., 429 U.S. 610, 97 S. Ct. 861, 51 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1977), (""Forner II""), the court rejected an inference of market power based on 
the existence of the tie itself by noting that proof that Fortner paid a higher price for the tied product is consistent with the possibility that the financing [the tying 
product] was unusually inexpensive and that the price for the entire package was equal to, or below, a competitive price. "
401,16," In fact, the compilation from which plaintiffs have drawn their pricing information estimated the ""Range of Capital Needed"" for 
setting up a Nutri/System franchise at $65,000-95,000 and a Diet Center franchise at $15,000-30,000.  Moreover, of the 26 
weight control franchises surveyed, Diet Center had among the lowest ranges of capital required. "
402,17," A franchisee may still be able to prove injury if the illegal tie coerces him to buy products or services which are unwanted or of 
unexpectedly inferior quality causing him to lose customers and revenue.  He will thus be able to establish damage arising not 
from the allegedly anticompetitive price of the package for which he bargained but from the excess cost or inferiority of items 
which he has no choice but to continue purchasing. Cf. Roberts, supra. In Roberts, the Court held that defendant franchisor 
could not, absent justification, tie its trademark to the use of a particular bookkeeping service which plaintiff franchisee 
complained was incompetent. Although the Court of Appeals did not address the damage issue, plaintiff in Roberts might have 
established injury arising from the unexpectedly poor quality, and thus cost, of the bookkeeping service which he was required to 
use. Plaintiffs here do not claim that they were damaged because the Diet Supp they were required to purchase was unwanted, hurt 
their business or was in any way unsatisfactory. On the contrary, they concede that the Diet Supp is effective and important to 
the weight-loss program. They merely desire to buy it elsewhere. "
405,1," AII operates in what has become known as the ""gray market,"" in which legitimately produced goods are imported without the 
authorization of the trademark or copyright holder. A gray market is created when an arbitrageur takes advantage of a price 
difference between two markets by buying in the market where prices are lower and selling in the market where prices are 
higher. The Hummel figures at issue here are genuine items produced by Goebel; what Goebel seeks to challenge is AII's 
unauthorized importation of them into the country."
405,2," Section 106 provides, in pertinent part, that ""the owner of a copyright under this title has the exclusive right to do and to 
authorize any of the following: . . . . ""(3) to distribute copies . . . of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership. . . ."" 17 U.S.C. § 106 
(1982). Section 602(a) provides: ""Importation into the United States, without the authority of the owner of the copyright under this title, of 
copies . . .  of a work that have been acquired outside the United States is an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute 
copies . . . under section 106. . . ."" 17 U.S.C. § 602(a) (1982). "
406,3," On the question of which plaintiffs have standing to bring antitrust suits, Professors Areeda and Turner have written: HN2[
] In an effort to cope with the infinite numbers of possible plaintiffs the courts have required (1) that the plaintiffs be 
injured in fact, (2) that the injury be to his ""business or property,"" (3) that the injury be of the type the antitrust laws were 
intended to prevent, (4) that there be significant causal connection between the defendant's violation and the plaintiff's 
injury, and (5) that the injury flow from that which makes the defendant's acts unlawful. P. Areeda and D. Turner, II Antitrust Law para. 334a (1978). As is demonstrated below, AII fails to show that it suffered any 
injury, much less an injury of the sort the antitrust laws were intended to prevent. "
408,4," Similarly, at oral argument, counsel for Goebel quite properly noted that a film based on a novel was copyrightable on its own. "

chapter by issuing appropriate orders, including, but not limited to: ordering any person to divest himself of any interest,

including, but not limited to, prohibiting any person from engaging in the same type of endeavor as the enterprise engaged 
in, the activities of which affect interstate or foreign commerce; or ordering dissolution or reorganization of any enterprise, 
making due provision for the rights of innocent persons. "
414,," (b) The Attorney General may institute proceedings under this section. In any action brought by the United States under this 
section, the court shall proceed as soon as practicable to the hearing and determination thereof. Pending final 
determination thereof, the court may at any time enter such restraining orders or prohibitions, or take such other actions, 
including the acceptance of satisfactory performance bonds, as it shall deem proper. (c) Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor 
in any appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, 
including a reasonable attorney's fee. (d) A final judgment or decree rendered in favor of the United States in any criminal proceeding brought by the United 
States under this chapter shall estop the defendant from denying the essential allegations of the criminal offense in any 
subsequent civil proceeding brought by the United States."

417,18," RICO had a long legislative lineage. The Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 was derived from S. 30, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., 
115 Cong. Rec. 769 (1969). Title IX of the Act, RICO, was added to S. 30 by the Senate. The substance of Title IX was 
contained in an earlier Senate bill, S. 1861, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., 115 Cong. Rec. 9568-71 (1969). Neither S. 1861 nor S. 30 
contained a private civil cause of action. An earlier predecessor of RICO, S. 1623, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., 115 Cong. Rec. 6995-
96 (1969), did contain a private civil cause of action based closely on the Clayton Act, providing explicitly for injunctive relief as 
well as for treble damages. S.1623 §§ 3(c), 4(a). That bill was itself patterned on two earlier Senate bills, S. 2048 and S. 2049, 
90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967), both of which contained civil private actions similar to that in S. 1623. The Senate Subcommittee 
on Criminal Laws and Procedures of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary replaced S. 1623 with S. 1861 apparently in part 
because S. 1861 provided broader governmental civil relief, such as the investigative demand, and was in other ways a more 
comprehensive bill. See Hearings on Measures Relating to Organized Crime Before the Subcomm. on Criminal Laws and 
Procedures of the Sen. Comm. on the Judiciary, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 387 (1969) [hereinafter, ""Hearings on S. 30""]; Bradley, 
supra note 8, at 841-42 & nn.27-28. There is no discussion in the legislative history indicating why S. 1861 did not provide a 
private cause of action. Professor Blakey, then Chief Counsel to the Senate Subcommittee, subsequently has written that the 
private civil section was dropped ""in an effort to streamline [the bill] and sidestep a variety of complex legal issues, as well as 
possible political problems in trying to process legislation that expressly created a variety of both public and private remedies."" 
Blakey & Gettings, supra note 6, at 1017-18. There were also a number of House predecessors to RICO which paralleled S. 30. See H.R. 19215, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., 116 
Cong. Rec. 31914, H.R. 19586, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., 116 Cong. Rec. 35242 (1970). The private cause of action section 
eventually inserted by the House was taken from H.R. 19586. H.R. 19215 included a much more complete private cause of 
action section, explicitly allowing for private party injunctive relief. See Blakey & Gettings, supra note 6, at 1020. While one may or may not agree with Blakey & Gettings that it is ""unfortunate"" that H.R. 19215 was not used, id., it is significant 
that it was not. The more general H.R. 19586 was obviously less controversial, less likely to promote debate and hence more 
likely to result in passage of the bill. All of the amendments made by the House to S. 30 limited its scope, with the exception of the inclusion of a private remedy."
417,19," [**18] Failure to recognize this crucial point has led a number of courts and commentators astray. For example, the original 
Eighth Circuit panel in Bennett v. Berg, 685 F.2d 1053, 1058 (8th Cir. 1982), aff'd en banc, 710 F.2d 1361, cert. denied sub nom.  
Prudential Ins. Co. of America v. Bennett, 464 U.S. 1008, 104 S. Ct. 527, 78 L. Ed. 2d 710 (1983), states that ""section 
1964(c) provides a private cause of action modelled on the antitrust laws"" and then for its first citation to this effect refers to S. 
Rep. No. 617, 80-82, 125, 160 (1969). Yet every statement made in that Senate Report relates exclusively to civil remedies not 
including a private civil right of action, but only concerning the government's right to seek an injunction or forfeiture under the 
provisions of section 1963(a). This is not to say, of course, that the House insertion of the private treble damage action was not 
based on an analog to the antitrust laws, for it is obviously somewhat patterned in part after section 4(a) of the Clayton Act. 15 
U.S.C. § 15(a) (1982). Indeed, the testimony of Edward L. Wright, then ABA president, in the House hearings on S. 30, the 
absolutely critical testimony leading to the inclusion of section 1964(c) in the House version of the bill, says only: In the portion seeking to add a proposed Section 1964, ""Civil Remedies,"" we would recommend an amendment to include 
the additional civil remedy of authorizing private damage suits based upon the concept of Section 4 of the Clayton Act. 
Section 4 provides as follows: [quoting 15 U.S.C. § 4]. House Hearings, supra note 9, at 543-44. "
418,20," House Hearings, supra note 9, at 520 (Proposal of Rep. Steiger), 548 (Proposal of the American Bar Association). Both 
proposals were patterned on the private remedy found in the Clayton Act. Significantly Steiger's proposal, like those in the 
rejected Senate bills, provided explicitly for a private injunctive remedy. Id. at 521. The legislative history is silent as to why the 
subcommittee rejected this language and explicitly created only the private action for treble damages which was eventually 
enacted as § 1964(c). The adopted statutory language was drawn from H.R. 19586, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 56 (1970), one of the 
two House bills which paralleled S. 30. In choosing H.R. 19586 over H.R. 19215, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970), the House 
explicitly rejected a private injunctive relief section. See supra note 18. Later, on the House floor, an amendment also offered by Representative Steiger to provide private injunctive relief was 
withdrawn before the House could vote on it. 116 Cong. Rec. 35346 (1969). In the next term of the Senate the same amendment 
was proposed as a bill, S. 16, 92nd Cong., 1st Sess. (1971), as a way to ""expand the available civil remedies"" since ""now only 
the United States can institute injunctive proceedings."" See Victims of Crime, Hearing before the Subcom. on Criminal Laws and 
Procedures of the Senate Com. of the Judiciary, 92nd Cong., 1st Sess. 158 (1972) (Statement of Richard Velde, Associate 
Administrator, Law Enforcement Assistance Administration) [hereinafter ""Victims of Crime""].  While post-enactment legislative 
history is not by any means conclusive, it cannot merely be ignored.  North Haven Bd. of Educ. v. Bell, 456 U.S. 512, 530-35, 72 
L. Ed. 2d 299, 102 S. Ct. 1912 (1982). It thus seems altogether likely that § 1964(c) as it now stands was not intended to provide 
private parties injunctive relief. But see Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co. v. Liebowitz, 570 F. Supp. 908, 909-10 (E.D.N.Y. 1983) 
(injunctive relief granted), aff'd on other grounds, 730 F.2d 905, slip op. at 2510 (2d Cir. 1984). Two other courts of appeals have 
reserved judgment on this issue.  Dan River, Inc. v. Icahn, 701 F.2d 278, 290 (4th Cir. 1983); Bennett v. Berg, 685 F.2d at 1064. Professor Blakey also disagrees with this conclusion, making a rather remarkable argument based upon the use of the word 
""and"" in § 1964(c), as follows. He states: A Congressional grant of the right to sue in the absence of statutory limitations, conveys the availability of all necessary and 
appropriate relief. See, e.g., Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396 U.S. 229, 239, 24 L. Ed. 2d 386, 90 S. Ct. 400 (1969); 
Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 684, 90 L. Ed. 939, 66 S. Ct. 773 (1946). Significantly, the treble damage clause of § 1964(c) is 
preceded by ""and"" and not ""to."" See National R. R. Passenger Corp. v. National Ass'n of R.R. Passengers, 414 U.S. 453, 
458, 38 L. Ed. 2d 646, 94 S. Ct. 690 (1974) (grant of right in one form implies denial of right in another). Consequently, the 
availability of comprehensive civil relief should prove of particular significance, for example, in the area of government fraud 
at the state and local level. Blakey & Gettings, supra note 6, at 1038 n.133. We do not find it significant that the word ""and"" is used in § 1964(c), especially since its treble damage antitrust analog, § 4 of 
the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15(a) (1982), uses the same word, ""and,"" while a different specific statutory provision of that act 
expressly gives a private antitrust plaintiff the right to seek an injunction (except when a common carrier is a defendant). Clayton 
Act § 16, 15 U.S.C. § 26 (1982). We endorse Judge Shadur's comment that an argument based on the word ""and"" is ""bizarre 
and wholly unconvincing as a matter of plain English."" Kaushal v. State Bank of India, 556 F. Supp. 576, 582 & n.17 (N.D. Ill. 
1983). Indeed, the Supreme Court has explicitly held that the parallel language of § 4 of the Clayton Act precluded private 
injunctive relief. Paine Lumber Co. v. Neal, 244 U.S. 459, 61 L. Ed. 1256, 37 S. Ct. 718 (1917); Minnesota v. Northern Secs. 
Co., 194 U.S. 48, 48 L. Ed. 870, 24 S. Ct. 598 (1904)."
418,21," One Judiciary Committee member indicated on the floor that three changes had been made from the Senate bill ""merit[ing] 
discussion,"" but did not include the addition of the private cause of action among these three. 116 Cong. Rec. 35197-98 (1970) 
(remarks of Congressman McCulloch). "
419,22," 116 Cong. Rec. 35295 (1970) (remarks of Congressman Poff). Beyond this cursory statement, there are only two indications 
that the House was even made aware of the fact that the bill included a private cause of action. First there was Representative 
Steiger's amendment, quickly withdrawn, to add an injunctive remedy to the private action. See discussion supra note 20. More 
significantly, Representative (now Judge) Mikva offered an amendment providing for treble damages for defendants who 
became subjects of frivolous suits under the section. See 116 Cong. Rec. 35342-43 (1970). The evident purpose of this 
amendment, which was quickly defeated, id., was to point out the dangerous overbreadth of the section, which Mikva claimed 
was a ""dangerous tool . . . given to a competitor who wants to go after somebody who is competing too vigorously against him."" 
Id. at 35342. We decline to infer from Representative Mikva's comments the conclusion that Congress intended to promulgate a 
statute as broad as the one he feared it was passing. Deriving legislative intent from a dissenting congressman's ""parade of 
horrors"" speeches in opposition is a notoriously dubious practice."

422,36," In another recent criminal RICO case the Court similarly rejected a narrow reading of the word ""interest"" in § 1963(a)(1).  
Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16,    , 104 S. Ct. 296, 300, 78 L. Ed. 2d 17 (1983). As it did in Turkette, the Court relied 
upon the plain meaning of the statutory language, also making reference to the liberal construction clause in RICO. Id. at 302. 
The Court also repeated its conclusion that the legislative history of RICO suggests that Congress intended the criminal 
provisions to be given a broad construction. Id. at 302-03."
422,37," United States v. Forsythe, 560 F.2d 1127, 1135 (3d Cir. 1977) (""State law offenses are not the gravamen of RICO offenses. 
RICO was not designed to punish state law violations; it was designed to punish the impact on commerce caused by conduct 
which meets the statute's definition of racketeering activity.""). Cf.  United States v. Bledsoe, 674 F.2d 647, 659 (8th Cir. 1982) 
(""RICO was not designed to serve as a recidivist statute, imposing heavier sentences for crimes which are already punishable

423,38," It can be argued that a ""pattern of racketeering activity"" is defined merely in terms of predicate offenses and nothing more, § 
1961(1), (5), so the fact that racketeering activity must be proved under § 1964(c) does not in itself require that something other 
than the predicate offenses be proved. On the other hand the statutory definition states that a pattern ""requires at least two acts 
of racketeering activity. . . ."" 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) (emphasis added). An argument can be made that the use of the word 
""requires"" instead of the word ""means"" implies that Congress left it to the courts to define the contours of the concept of 
""pattern."" See Bridges, supra note 6, at 64-65 & n.119. Here Senator McClellan's observations, quoted in id. at n.118, may 
assume importance: The [ACLU] offers an inaccurate and prejudicial criticism of title IX when it states that ""pattern of racketeering activity"" is 
defined as two or more acts of ""racketeering activity,"" and worries that a person could be subjected to the sanctions of title 
IX simply for committing two widely separated and isolated criminal offenses, one of which related to an interstate business. 
Again, a careful reading of title IX would have informed the union that a pattern under title IX is not defined as two or more 
acts of racketeering activity, but requires them. The term ""pattern"" itself requires the showing of a relationship, and the committee report . . . thus reinforces that 
interpretation. So, therefore, proof of two acts of racketeering activity, without more, does not establish a pattern and the 
ACLU's fears are unwarranted."

424,40," Thus, in an interesting paper in the post-legislative history, the American Law Division of the Library of Congress, after 
reviewing the purposes of RICO and of the antitrust laws, concluded that ""given the similarity of language and circumstances 
between the antitrust provisions and those of the Organized Crime Control Act, there is no reason to believe that many of these 
[antitrust] principles and problems would [not] be applicable to both [antitrust and RICO] types of cases."" Reprinted in Victims of 
Crime, supra note 20, at 331. See Landmark Savs. & Loan, 527 F. Supp. at 208-09 (""Competitive injuries and racketeering 
enterprise injuries would frequently overlap, but they are not necessarily the same.""). See also Bridges, supra note 6, at 68-73 & 
nn. 133-34."
424,41," For example, recent antitrust cases which focus on market efficiency rather than on damage to business people, see, e.g., 
Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 53 n.21, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977), are not relevant to the 
requirements of RICO standing. Nothing in RICO suggests, then, that only competitors can sue, or that Congress in enacting 
RICO was more concerned with economic efficiency than with providing remedies for victims of organized crime. See Note, Civil 
RICO, supra note 35, at 1113-14 (""RICO's explicit aim to promote free competition focuses as much on insuring a fair market as 
on insuring an efficient one. Thus, the state should protect the plaintiff injured competitively by a corrupt business even at a cost 
to market efficiency.""). Similarly, claims alleging the kinds of business fraud which often affect competition should go forward under RICO even if in the 
particular case no harm to competition results, as, for example, when all competitors are being extorted from equally. For 
example, in Hellenic Lines, Ltd. v. O'Hearn, 523 F. Supp. 244 (S.D.N.Y. 1981), a company was forced to pay kickbacks to an 
illegal enterprise for required services. A RICO claim was allowed even though defendant claimed that the inflated price was still 
reasonable so that no injury to competition had occurred. It was enough that the plaintiff's alleged injury was the kind of injury 
which Congress identified as threatening competition. The fact that the suit may not have been viable under the Clayton Act 
shows that the two standing requirements overlap but are not identical. We do not in this business fraud case attempt to define the scope of the standing requirement when the RICO suit is based upon 
securities law violations. "
425,42," See, e.g., Glusband v. Benjamin, 530 F. Supp. 240, 241 (S.D.N.Y. 1981); Harper v. New Japan Secs. Int'l, Inc., 545 F. Supp. 
1002, 1007 n.8 (C.D. Cal. 1982); Mauriber v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 546 F. Supp. 391, 396 (S.D.N.Y. 1982); Heinold 
Commodities, Inc. v. McCarty, 513 F. Supp. 311, 313-14 (N.D. Ill. 1979). But see Van Schaick v. Church of Scientology of Cal., 
Inc., 535 F. Supp. 1125, 1137 n.12 (D. Mass. 1982) (dicta that criminal convictions may be required); Kleiner v. First Nat'l Bank 
of Atlanta, 526 F. Supp. 1019, 1022 n.2 (N.D. Ga. 1981) (id.), overruled on other grounds, Morosani v. First Nat'l Bank of Atlanta, 
703 F.2d 1220 (11th Cir. 1983). Certain other cases holding that criminal convictions are not required have relied in part upon the ""liberal construction"" language 
in Turkette, 452 U.S. at 580-81. See USACO Coal Co. v. Carbomin Energy, Inc., 689 F.2d 94, 95 n.1 (6th Cir. 1982); cf.  
Glusband, 530 F. Supp. at 241 (following Turkette's plain meaning analysis). For reasons we stated previously, we do not find 
the language in Turkette particularly helpful in analyzing this problem. "
426,43," 689 F.2d at 95 n.1. Two other courts have forwarded versions of this same argument.  State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Caton, 540 F. Supp. 673, 675 
(N.D. Ind. 1982); Parnes v. Heinold Commodities, Inc., 487 F. Supp. 645, 647 (N.D. Ill. 1980). Other courts have relied on 
USACO while holding or saying that criminal convictions are not necessary.  Bunker Ramo Corp. v. United Business Forms, Inc., 
713 F.2d 1272, 1287 (7th Cir. 1983); Moss v. Morgan Stanley, Inc., 719 F.2d 5, 19 n.15 (2d Cir. 1983) (dicta), cert. denied sub 
nom.  Moss v. Newman, 465 U.S. 1025, 104 S. Ct. 1280, 79 L. Ed. 2d 684 (1984); Barker v. Underwriters at Lloyd's, London,

426,44," It would be a strained construction to say that any person by virtue of § 1964(c), which gives such a person only a right to 
damages, would also have a right to sue for permanent injunctive relief under subsection (a). See supra text at note 24. The 
differences between the private remedy sections in the Clayton Act and in RICO are particularly significant here. There are 
specific Clayton Act provisions giving the government and individuals the right to bring actions for injunctive relief, 15 U.S.C. §§ 
25-26 (government, private persons), something which is not set forth in RICO § 1964 or evidently recognized by the Cappetto 
court when it speaks of the Clayton Act's § 4.  502 F.2d at 1357. Moreover, section 1964(a) speaks of ""jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of section 1962,"" on its face allowing 
injunctions before the violations have occurred or criminal prosecution commenced. Subsection (c), on the other hand, speaks of 
injury ""by reason of a violation of section 1962,"" language which at least suggests that the violation must be proved criminally 
before the action commences."
426,45," Blakey & Gettings, supra note 6, at 1040. See House Hearings, supra note 9, at 543-44 (ABA report). Cf. Bridges, supra note 
6, at 68-70. "
427,46," We are fully aware that the ""by reason of a violation"" language can be found in the earlier Senate and House bills which did 
contain private civil remedies. S. 1623, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., § 4(a) (1969); S. 2048, S. 2049, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967); 
H.R. 19586, H.R. 19215, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970). See supra note 18 for a discussion of these bills. Nevertheless, the 
question remains why the House chose this language over the language of the Clayton Act."
427,47," We note in the post-legislative history that this conclusion was rejected by the American Law Division of the Library of 
Congress in its comparative study of RICO and the Clayton Act, see Victims of Crime, supra note 20, at 323, 329, on the basis 
that ""violation"" is used elsewhere in the antitrust laws, e.g., in 15 U.S.C. §§ 4, 25, 26. But two of the provisions cited in that study 
have their own parallels in RICO: 15 U.S.C. §§ 4 and 25 are equivalents of 18 U.S.C. § 1964(a) giving district courts jurisdiction 
to prevent and restrain violations at the behest of the government. And the other Clayton Act provision cited, 15 U.S.C. § 26, 
which has no parallel in RICO, gives similar jurisdiction at the behest of private parties, a matter which the American Law 
Division study sought explicitly to remedy as to RICO. Thus, the American Law Division statement does not meet the argument 
based on the difference in language between the treble damage private action provisions which are otherwise parallel, 15 U.S.C. 
§ 15 and 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)."
427,48," The Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 makes only ""willful"" violations criminally punishable. Section 32(a), 15 U.S.C. § 78ff 
(1982). On ""offense"" under the securities laws in RICO, see generally Bridges, supra note 6, at 63-64. "
428,49," The American Bar Association has recommended that the RICO statute be amended to replace the term ""racketeering activity"" 
with the phrase ""criminal activity"" as a way to resolve this problem. Report to the House of Delegates, 1982 ABA Sec. Crim. 
Just. Rep. 3-4 (Jan. 1982). Cf.  United States v. Guiliano, 644 F.2d 85, 89 (2d Cir. 1981) (prejudicial taint inevitably surrounds 
label of ""racketeer""). As we have indicated in supra note 24, there are potential constitutional problems created by the broad reading of RICO 
endorsed by many courts. At some point defendants are entitled to the constitutional protections of the criminal law regardless of 
how the government chooses to characterize a given cause of action. See Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 634-35, 29 L. 
Ed. 746, 6 S. Ct. 524 (1886). Relevant factors in characterizing an action as ""criminal"" are the nature of the underlying offense, 
the stigma attached to the charge made, In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 23-25, 18 L. Ed. 2d 527, 87 S. Ct. 1428 (1967), the nature of 
the punishment authorized by the statute, Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 94-95, 2 L. Ed. 2d 630, 78 S. Ct. 590 (1958), the intent of 
Congress in promulgating the statute, id., and whether the government or a private party is bringing the action. See generally 
Note, infra note 59, at 210-12. Reading private civil RICO suits not to require criminal convictions would provide civil remedies 
for offenses criminal in nature, stigmatize defendants with the appellation ""racketeer,"" authorize the award of damages which are 
clearly punitive, including attorney's fees, and constitute a civil remedy aimed in part to avoid the constitutional protections of the 
criminal law. Thus, the construction advanced in this opinion avoids serious constitutional questions."
428,50," This structure is, of course, altered to some extent by the provision which allows the government to seek injunctive relief in the 
absence of criminal convictions. As we have indicated, however, injunctive relief to prevent violations is simply a very different 
kind of remedy than a treble damages action and is accordingly subject to a unique regimen. It would be contrary to the entire 
purpose of equitable remedies if their utilization had to await the imposition of criminal sanctions. The argument made in text is nowhere answered by our dissenting brother."

429,," [There is] a significant distinction between section 1964 and the antitrust laws . . . . [Sherman Act] civil actions may be

430,57," House Hearings, supra note 9, at 106-07, 664, 687. All of this discussion referred only to the government's private action. 
Nevertheless, some witnesses in the House hearings assumed that the ""pattern of racketeering activity"" element in a civil suit 
would have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. See id. at 328-29 (Report of the Association of the Bar of the City of New 
York). Our dissenting brother does not directly confront the burden of proof problems except by apparently suggesting that a 
preponderance standard is sufficient (dissenting op., [slip op.] page 6), but that if it is not some heightened standard would be 
(dissenting op., [slip op.] pp. 7-8). Having in mind Congress's omission to examine this problem except very obliquely, as we 
point out in text, to attempt to draw a jury charge dealing with different burdens of proof is not only a very difficult task, likely to 
cause great confusion, but also not a little bit of the judicial legislation Judge Cardamone decries. And to accept the proposition 
that you can prove criminal acts, notes 50 supra and 58 infra, by a preponderance of the evidence raises its own problems of a 
higher magnitude, as we point out in text."
430,58," See Blakey & Gettings, supra note 6, at 1031-32: Congress believed that the normal practice of following a policy of strict construction . . . was inappropriate in the context of 
RICO, since RICO did not draw a line between criminal and innocent conduct. Instead, RICO authorized the imposition of 
different criminal or civil remedies on conduct already criminal, when performed in a specified fashion. Once the policies of 
strict construction or leniency had been implemented in the construction of the underlying ""racketeering activity,"" and the 
line had been crossed into the sphere of criminality, it was inappropriate to further restrict the scope of the statute by 
reapplying these policies. (Emphasis added) (footnote omitted). This point is simply not addressed by our dissenting brother. See note 50 supra. "
431,59," Proponents of a broad reading of the statute apply Clayton Act provisions by analogy when they suggest that since criminal 
convictions are not required there, they should not be required under RICO. At the same time they urge that the Clayton Act 
standing provisions should not be applied in interpreting RICO. "
432,1," L. Carroll, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, (Children's Classic ed.) 25. "
436,2," I cannot agree with the majority's view that Turkette and other Supreme Court cases in the criminal area have no application to 
the issues raised on this appeal. In the first place, Turkette itself specifically refers to the civil provisions, noting that they ""could 
be useful in eradicating organized crime from the social fabric, whether the enterprise be ostensibly legitimate or admittedly 
criminal."" Id. at 585. Further, the majority's concerns over ""federalization"" of the common law of fraud are identical to the concern 
in Turkette regarding the balance between federal and state enforcement of criminal law, which the Supreme Court noted was 
considered specifically by Congress, and which provided no basis for courts ""to restrict the application of the statute."" Id. at 587. "
454,1," LPM argues that ""consumers of lift truck replacement parts obviously do not base their purchasing decisions on the 
appearance of such parts."" This contention, however, nowhere finds support in the amended complaint, the pleading before the 
court; moreover, it is not a proper subject of judicial notice.  It obviously is a defense that should be asserted in LPM's answer. "
459,2," LPM's motion and its initial supporting memorandum sought summary judgment as to the entirety of Clark's copyright 
infringement claim on the ground that part number information cannot be copyrighted; the general publication theory was clearly 
asserted as an alternative, independent ground for summary judgment on the copyright claim.  As described in the main text, 
however, when the record is construed in Clark's favor it appears that LPM copied a great deal more than part number 
information.  Consequently, the extent of the copyright protection due part number information, standing alone, cannot be 
dispositive of the infringement claim.  Recognizing this, LPM in its reply memorandum shifts gears and asserts, in effect, that it 
intended to advance the parts-number ground as a basis for partial summary judgment on the infringement claim.  It would be 
fundamentally unfair if the court allowed LPM to revise the scope and underlying theory of its motion in a reply memorandum to 
which Clark had no opportunity to respond; it is too late for LPM to argue that it wants something other than that which it 
originally requested.  However, even if the court were to address separately the issue of whether part numbers, standing alone, 
can be copyrighted, it is doubtful that the issue would be resolved in LPM's favor.  The gravamen of its argument is that the part 
number information cannot be copyrighted by Clark as an industrious collection because it was self-generated.  There is no case 
law to support this novel proposition; indeed, by consistently affording copyright protection to self-generated compilations like 
telephone directories, courts have by implication rejected LPM's position on numerous occasions.  See, e.g., Leon v. Pacific 
Telephone & Telegraph Co., 91 F.2d 484 (9th Cir. 1937); Central Telephone Co. of Virginia v. Johnson Publishing Co., 526 F. 
Supp. 838 (D. Colo. 1981); Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Nationwide Independent Directory Service, Inc., 371 F. Supp. 
900 (W.D. Ark. 1974). The court, however, reserves final judgment on this issue for trial."
459,3," LPM maintains that these considerations actually militate in favor of summary judgment. Since there is a tremendous disparity 
between Clark's expenses and what it would cost LPM to obtain or generate similar information, it reasons that granting 
copyright protection to Clark would have pronounced anti-competitive effects.  There is, however, nothing in the record 
establishing either the extent of costs LPM would incur if it compiled its own information or the existence of the anticompetitive 
effects it describes.  The court, of course, cannot grant summary judgment in LPM's favor based on bare conjecture and 
speculation. "

465,1," Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) (6) provides: On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment,

466,2," In Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 331, 58 L. Ed. 2d 552, 99 S. Ct. 645 (1979), the Supreme Court held that a 
plaintiff may, when appropriate, preclude a defendant from relitigating issues that the defendant litigated and lost against another 
plaintiff.  This practice, which SPCC seeks to use in this case, is called offensive collateral estoppel. Offensive use of collateral 
estoppel is distinguished from defensive use of collateral estoppel. The latter occurs when a defendant seeks to preclude a 
plaintiff from relitigating an issue that the plaintiffs has litigated and lost against another defendant.  See id. at 326 n.4. Although 
offensive and defensive collateral estoppel are quite similar, the former raises certain considerations that are not raised by the 
latter.  See id. at 329-31."
466,3," The relevant market is the market in which an entity's power is measured to determine whether the entity is a monopolist for 
antitrust law purposes.  The relevant market is generally defined in both geographic and product terms.  See United States v.

470,9," In Parklane Hosiery, supra, the Supreme Court recognized that offensive use of collateral estoppel could be employed in a 
manner that, in fact, promotes judicial diseconomy.  439 U.S. at 329-30. Offensive collateral estoppel may encourage plaintiffs to 
""wait and see"" while other plaintiffs engage in test litigation against a common adversary because plaintiffs will never be bound 
by a previous judgment against another plaintiff but, with offensive use of collateral estoppel, may rely on another plaintiff's 
favorable judgment.  See id. Nevertheless, the promotion of judicial economy remains a goal of offensive collateral estoppel. The 
Court decided to leave to the district courts the task of protecting against abuse of the doctrine.  See id. at 331. "
477,1, 15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.; 15 U.S.C. § 12 et seq.
477,2," In October, 1980, B/4 and Sorbus merged into and became divisions of MAI. However, the defendants were separate 
corporations when this suit was instituted, and at all times relevant to the allegations in plaintiff's complaint. "
479,3," This was pursuant to para. 2(C) and (D) of the dealer agreement, which regulated the sales of B/4 products to customers 
outside of a dealer's exclusive territory. "
480,4," HN1[
] Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a) requires only that a plaintiff set forth ""a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."" As discussed infra, 3PM's complaint adequately alleges the elements of a tying arrangement. HN2[
]"
480,5," Thus Count II can be regarded as alleging a tying arrangement, even though para. 23 of the dealer agreement does not require 
the purchase of the peripheral units which defendants offered for sale. This provision of the agreement forbade 3PM to purchase 
such units from any of defendants' competitors."
480,6," Although the Sherman and Clayton Acts were earlier considered to set forth differing standards in this regard, it is now well 
accepted that the same standards apply under both Acts. See, e.g.  Moore v. James H. Matthews & Co., 550 F.2d 1207 (9th Cir. 
1977). "
481,7," The terms of this loan were unique in three respects. First, the loan covered 100% of the cost of acquiring and developing 
certain real estate. Second, the loan was not guaranteed by any of the shareholders or officers of the plaintiff corporation. 
Finally, the loan was offered at an unusually low rate of interest.  Fortner II, 429 U.S. at 616. "
482,8," See complaint at paras. 7, 9, 10, and 12: Plaintiff has been for many years in the business of servicing and marketing computers for various businesses within the

482,*," * * * The purpose and effect of the requirement for the use of Sorbus by plaintiff was financially to benefit Sorbus and its parent 
company MAI and to establish a customer base for Sorbus, Inc. in the Detroit area to the detriment of plaintiff. "
483,9," See II E. Kintner, Federal Antitrust Law at 238 (1980): Under the rule of Fortner II, inquiry into the uniqueness of a given product must focus on whether the seller in the tying 
market has the ability either to charge a price or impose a burden that he would not be able to extract in a competitive 
market. Without a showing of either (1) some cost advantage on the part of the seller, or (2) a characteristic of the tying 
item that sufficiently differentiates the product so that no competitor could offer the product if he so chooses, the 
uniqueness of the product will not support a finding of economic power. Thus, the mere fact that a product is attractive will 
not establish sufficient economic power.  (Footnotes omitted.)"
483,10," Bittick asserts that none of these other manufacturers offered such products until 1978, and that the other products were still 
inferior to those manufactured by defendants at the time of his affidavit. These statements may create a factual dispute as to 
whether defendants' competitors did produce substantially equivalent products. As discussed above, however, this is not the 
pertinent inquiry. 3PM is required to establish that defendants' competitors could not produce equivalent products, and Bittick's 
statements do not tend to prove this proposition. "
484,11," See Capital Temporaries, Inc. v. Olsten Corp., supra, 506 F.2d at 663: The appellant misreads Loew's if he concludes that the mere existence of the copyrighted tying motion pictures was 
enough to create the tying. The tied films were also copyrighted . . . The tying was created by the attractiveness of some of 
the films, as contrasted to the inferior quality of the others also required to be purchased in the package."
484,12," This would require a showing that the B/4 trademark has attained national preeminence, and is usually attractive as a result. 
See Krehl v. Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream Co., supra; see generally Kintner, supra, at 249. "
485,13," Indeed, it was undisputed in Fortner II that defendant had entered into the alleged tying arrangements with a large number of 
its customers. The Court held that this evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to establish that defendant possessed 
economic power in the market for the tying product."
485,14," See 2 J. von Kalinowski, Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulation at § 6G.05[2] (1983): The number of tying arrangements that would constitute some evidence of economic power in the market for the tying 
product was referred to as a host of tying arrangements in Northern Pacific and as any appreciable number in Fortner I. 
Fortner II makes clear, however, that these HN8[
] vague terms of quantity will only establish proof of economic power "
486,," provided (1) there is also evidence of the seller's power over price and (2) there is no evidence of any other explanation 
such as price competition for the willingness of the customers to accept the seller's tie-in. (original emphasis.)"
486,15," In addition, defendants have produced unrebutted evidence which offers other explanations for the buyers' willingness to 
accept the tie-ins alleged. See defendants' reply brief at 30, n. 19."
486,16," HN9[
] A finding that an alleged tying arrangement is not a per se violation usually does not end the court's inquiry, as a 
plaintiff may also attempt to prove that a tying arrangement violates the rule of reason. See Fortner I, 394 U.S. at 500. Under this 
theory, a plaintiff is required to establish the facts peculiar to the business involved, its condition before and after the alleged 
restraint was applied, the nature and history of the alleged restraint, the reason for adopting the alleged restraint, and its actual 
or probable effect.  Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 62 L. Ed. 683, 38 S. Ct. 242 (1918)."
486,3," PM's only comments on this issue suffer from the same infirmity which permeates much of its arguments on these motions: a 
propensity to allege every imaginable form of tying arrangement, coupled with a refusal to indicate clearly what is alleged or 
what evidence is proffered in support. In this regard, 3PM has consistently contended that the tying arrangements alleged are 
per se illegal, and has made no attempt whatsoever to present any evidence which would establish liability under the rule of 
reason. In the final paragraph of its reply brief, however, 3PM states: Plaintiff believes the claims here stated are properly characterized and correctly analyzed, and that these claims may be 
inexpensively decided without the necessity of submitting to the jury the issue of the unreasonableness of defendants' 
conduct and without the necessity of presenting market study evidence and expert witness evidence from economists. But 
should the Court conclude otherwise, it is respectfully requested that plaintiff be given the opportunity to submit such issues 
and to explore the availability of such evidence, and to present it, if needed. Id. at 41. HN10[
] Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) provides: When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon 
the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but his response, by affidavits or otherwise provided in this rule, must set 
forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. Defendants have here moved for summary judgment on all counts of 3PM's complaint. 3PM cannot avoid a grant of 
summary judgment merely by requesting an ""opportunity . . . to explore the availability of . . .  evidence"", and the Court 
therefore must deny 3PM the ""opportunity"" requested. "
488,17," The only contrary authority offered by 3PM is Eiberger v. Sony Corp. of America, 622 F.2d 1068 (2d Cir. 1980). For two 
reasons, Eiberger does not aid 3PM in the case at bar. First, the acts alleged in Eiberger were significantly different from those 
alleged in the case at bar. Eiberger did not involve a practice which allegedly resulted in the termination of one distributor so that 
another could be appointed. Rather, it involved a restraint which prohibited all distributors from engaging in price competition. 
Second, the court in Eiberger noted that any liability under the Sherman Act resulting from territorial restrictions arose solely 
under the rule of reason. Plaintiff in that case had presented evidence which established that the alleged restraints maintained 
retail prices at an artificially high level, eliminated intrabrand competition, but did not enhance interbrand competition. Such a 
showing is a fundamental element of the offense which 3PM has attempted to allege, and it is an element as to which 3PM has 
presented no evidence whatsoever."
488,18," 3PM relies upon 5 Williston on Contracts § 677 (3d Ed. 1961), which provides: ""If a promisor is himself the cause of the failure 
of performance, either of an obligation due him or of a condition upon which his own liability depends, he cannot take advantage 
of the failure."" 3PM contends that its failure to achieve the quota requirements was caused by defendants' refusal to award 
quota credit, and that defendants should not have taken advantage of that failure by terminating 3PM's dealership. However, the 
above quoted language is qualified in the following section: ""An exception to this principle must be made where the hindrance is 
due to some action of the promisor which under the terms of the contract or the customs of business he was permitted to take."" 
Id. at § 677A. Under the parties' agreement, defendants were granted discretion to deny quota credit for out-of-territory sales; 
they were accordingly not prevented from terminating 3PM on the ground that it had failed to meet its quota requirements."
488,19," 3PM asserts that it received only 40% quota credit for this sale, while it should have received 50%. This represents a 
difference of only $2,111.04 in quota credit. Even if this additional quota credit had been granted to 3PM it would have fallen 
short of its quota requirement by more than $150,000.00. "
489,20," The parties' dealer agreement provided that ""this Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall be 
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California."" Id. at P 30. "
490,21," In addition, 3PM's arguments in relation to Counts V and VI are anomalous in one other respect. The misrepresentation which 
was allegedly made by B/4 was that 3PM would not be terminated if its sales of B/4 products were ""progressing"". It is 
undisputed, however, that 3PM's sales were not progressing at the time of its termination. On the contrary, its sales had 
diminished dramatically, from a six-month period in which it surpassed its quota requirement to a period in which it achieved less 
than 23% of its quota. Accordingly, B/4's actions in terminating 3PM were not inconsistent with the representation it allegedly 
made."
490,22," The gravamen of 3PM's claim in this Count is that B/4 did not intend to have a long-term relationship with 3PM as a dealer. 
3PM contends that B/4 hoped to open a company-owned branch office in Detroit, and that 3PM's dealership was terminated so 
that this could be accomplished."
490,23, Kirkwood was B/4's Regional Manager of Dealerships. 
491,24," The dealer agreement further provided that it could be terminated by either party, for any reason, at the end of its three-year 
duration. Id.  at P 5(B)."
491,25," 3PM has attempted to place into issue the method by which B/4 established quota requirements for each of its dealers. 3PM 
did not include in its complaint any claims along these lines, and its arguments in this regard are therefore irrelevant to any issue 
before the Court on these motions. "
492,26," 3PM's characterization of this claim in its brief is equally cryptic: ""Count VII is a composite of the previous six claims and relies 
upon their cumulative effect."" Id. at 3. "
495,1," Of the original fifteen defendants, Sun Oil Company and Getty Oil Company entered into agreements of settlement that have 
been approved by the court. The remaining thirteen defendants are: Amerada Hess, Amoco Oil Company, Atlantic Richfield 
Company, BP Oil, Inc., Chevron Oil Company, Cities Service, Exxon Corporation, Gulf Oil Corporation, Mobil Oil Corporation, 
Phillips Petroleum Company, Shell Oil Company, Texaco, Inc., and Union Oil Company. "
496,2," Approximately 1,250 pages of memoranda in support of the motions, responses and replies were submitted to the court, with 
approximately five times that amount submitted in various appendices. I reviewed all of the memoranda in support of the parties' 
positions and parsed the appendices when necessary. June 25, 1984 was devoted to oral argument on the motions for summary 
judgment; the following day for the decertification motions."
496,3," Summary judgment was granted in favor of Shell and Getty against both Paul J. Bogosian and Louis J. Parisi, the individuals 
who filed the original actions. Summary judgment in favor of Exxon was granted as to Bogosian but not Parisi because as an 
Exxon lessee-dealer, Parisi had a possible vertical tying claim against Exxon.  Bogosian, 393 F. Supp. at 1053. "
497,4," With both dispositive motions, the defendants jointly filed a motion addressing points common to all of the defendants. In 
addition, certain of the defendants filed individual motions emphasizing particular circumstances which such defendants 
contended would require summary disposition in their favor even if denied on behalf of all the defendants generally. "
499,5," In Class Action Order No. 103, I expressly ruled that individual vertical claims against lessor defendants had not been and 
would not be certified for class treatment. Because class representatives Bogosian and Parisi were, at one time, lessee-dealers 
of Exxon, Gulf and Arco, plaintiffs possibly retained individual vertical claims against those three defendants. However, I 
declined to certify a class against those three defendants. The result of Class Action Order No. 103 is that class representatives 
Bogosian and Parisi may be able to maintain individual vertical claims against their respective lessors. I have not decided as of 
this time whether such claims will be tried together with or separate from the class-action horizontal conspiracy claims, if tried at 
all."
499,6," Nevertheless, I do not accept plaintiffs' argument that the court should not consider responses made by plaintiffs' experts in 
answer to defense counsels' questions that are unfavorable to plaintiffs' theories because it was only cross-examination. "
500,7," I will not repeat the arguments of counsel or set out the cases here. For an analysis of the parties' respective positions and the 
applicable case law, see Class Action Orders Nos. 6 & 69. "
501,8," Defendants' other major contention is that the lease agreements do not tie the purchase of lessor's gasoline to the leasehold. 
As support, defendants cite plaintiffs' expert witness testimony. Plaintiffs, however, cite other testimony of those same expert 
witnesses in support of their position that the leases do have the practical effect alleged. Once again, the apparently conflicting 
testimony along with plaintiffs' other evidence reveals a record with genuine issues of fact regarding the practical economic 
effect of the defendants' leases. "
503,9," Provided, of course, that plaintiffs could show the leases themselves had the practical economic effect alleged. "
504,10," The court in Bogosian attempted to distinguish Ungar by stating that Ungar had only decided on the facts present that 
coercion was a requirement in a tying case. Further, the facts of Ungar required coercion ""only because the conditioning of the "
505,," sale of one product upon purchase of another was not reflected in an agreement or in the operation of its terms."" 561 F.2d at 
450. I have several problems with this. In Ungar the court did not speak of the coercion requirement in any limited sense.  
Further, it seems logically inconsistent to posit that coercion is only necessary when there is no express contractual tie but not 
when there is one. Rather, it seems consistent to posit that coercion is always a requirement but in certain cases it may be 
presumed or inferred because of the existence of an express contractual tie. "
506,11," The court in Ungar used the district court's definition of the ""individual coercion doctrine"": ""Although the individual coercion doctrine has nowhere been explicated in detail, it appears to require proof by the plaintiff 
of such events and circumstances surrounding the relationship between the franchisor and each franchisee as will 
demonstrate that the franchisee was coerced into agreeing to an anticompetitive tie, usually of equipment or supplies."" 68

514,1," On July 19, the Clerk's Office received from the plaintiff a motion for leave to file a Supplemental Amended Complaint and a 
request for expedited procedure. The Supplemental Amended Complaint would add allegations that, in May of this year, Semi-
Alloys, through its Japanese agent, expressly threatened legal action under Semi-Alloy's corresponding patent against a 
Japanese would/be purchaser of Indium's tack-welded frame-lids. Plaintiff's motion, which did not recite a return date, will be placed on the calendar for the Court's next regularly scheduled

more accurate measure of market concentration than two-firm or four-firm concentration ratios, which merely are sums of the 
market shares of those firms, because it takes into account both the number and size distribution of all sellers in a market. "

Response to Plaintiff's Motion to Dismiss Counterclaims at 2-3. Accordingly, PDI et al.'s first and second counterclaims are 
dismissed. We discuss PDI et al.'s remaining counterclaim for declaratory relief, essentially the reverse of plaintiff's claim for 
such relief, in Part X, infra. "
551,6," HN8[
] An effective rule of reason analysis requires an examination of the relevant market. E.g., Donald B. Rice Tire Co. v. Michelin Tire Corp., 483 F. Supp. 750, 755 (D. Md.), aff'd, 638 F.2d 15 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 864, 70 L. Ed. 2d 164, 
102 S. Ct. 324 (1981). The relevant geographic market -- the United States -- is not disputed. Concerning the determination of 
the relevant product market, ""no more definite rule can be declared than that commodities reasonably interchangeable by 
consumers for the same purpose make up"" a relevant product market. United States v. E.I.  duPont de Nemours, 351 U.S. 377, 
394-95, 100 L. Ed. 1264, 76 S. Ct. 994 (1956); see also R. A. Posner, Antitrust § 437 (1974) (regarding ""cross-elasticity of 
demand"" as parallel concept in economics). There was ample evidence to support the jury's conclusion, see Verdict Form, Interrogatory No. 10, that wood drying through the 
RFV process constituted a relevant market. The jury heard expert testimony concerning the relevant product market from those 
knowledgeable in the business, as well as from an expert in economics, Ronald Wilder. See XIV at 17-21. The evidence showed 
that RFV kiln drying differed from conventional kiln drying in several significant respects affecting interchangeability: speed, cost, 
the types of wood susceptible to RFV drying, and the types of wood products amenable to the process. Moreover, defendants' "
552,," own evidence showed that they did not consider the price charged for conventional kilns when setting their price for RFV kilns. 
IX at 99-102. This evidence corroborates Wilder's opinion that the cross-elasticity of demand between RFV kilns and 
conventional kilns was ""very low."" XIV at 20. Thus, we find the evidence of an absence of reasonable interchangeability between 
RFV and conventional kilns sufficient to support the jury's finding that the RFV process constituted a relevant product market. "
555,7," We note here that the jury was specifically instructed to give careful scrutiny to expert testimony: Now, the Rules of Evidence ordinarily do not permit witnesses to testify as to opinions or conclusions. An exception to this 
rule exists as to those whom we call expert witnesses. Witnesses who by education and experience have become expert in 
some art, science, profession or calling, may state an opinion as to the relevant and material matter in which they profess to 
be an expert. And they may also state their reasons for the opinion. You should consider each expert opinion received in evidence in this case, and give it such weight as you may think it 
deserves. If you should decide that the opinion of an expert witness is not based upon sufficient education and experience, 
or if you should conclude that the reasons given in support of the opinion are not sound, or that the opinion is not supported 
by the evidence in the case, or is outweighed by other evidence, you may disregard the opinion entirely. In short, as I told you as the experts were testifying, you're not bound by their opinions. XIII at 9. "

documentation to Drywood's satisfaction irrevocably guaranteeing financing for the construction of one unit (as defined 
hereinabove) and shall cause commencement and completion of construction of the unit within twelve (12) months from the 
date hereof. Sublicensee shall diligently pursue the expeditious completion of the unit and the installation and operation of 
the Chamber. Within twenty-four (24) months from date hereof, Sublicensee shall have completed the ten (10) unit Facility 
referred to in paragraph 1 above."
556,10," Paragraph 12A of the sublicense provides: A. In the event of default by Sublicensee (or its assignee) in any of the terms or conditions of this Sublicense, and the 
failure to cure same on thirty (30) days written notice and demand by Drywood then, in addition to all other rights and 
remedies it may have under law and equity, Drywood may terminate its Sublicense; provided that if more than thirty (30) 
days is required to cure a default (other than payment of monies), then the default shall be deemed cured if Sublicensee 
commences to cure same within thirty (30) days and diligently pursues same to completion. An election by Drywood of one 
remedy shall not constitute a waiver of any other remedies which it may thereafter exercise."
556,11," Paragraph 1 of the amendment to the sublicense makes IWP's obligation to perform contingent upon Drywood/PDI's prior 
performance of one of three conditions. Paragraph 1 provides:"

either (a) informs Sublicensee that it, Drywood, stands ready (which must be verifiable) to construct, or contract for the 
construction of said Chambers, (b) inform Sublicensee that it, Drywood, is unable for any reason to construct or to contract 
for construction of said Chambers, or (c) from the date that Drywood delivers, or notifies Sublicensee that it stands ready to 
deliver, all necessary documentation and know-how to Sublicensee so as to allow Sublicensee to construct or contract for 
the construction of said Chambers, whichever date first occurs. * * *"" PX 54 "
557,12, See footnote 11. supra. 
558,13," We note that defendants assert that ""no party other than Power Dry (with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Power Dry Patent and 
GWP, which were legally incapable of inducing any breach by Power Dry) participated in the decision in January 1982 to notify 
plaintiff of the invalidity of its purported contract."" PDI et al. Brief in Support of Post Trial Motions; see also Compton Post-Trial 
Brief at 3, para 4; Crowley Post-Trial Brief at 20-21, para 3. These arguments, even assuming they were true, are irrelevant to 
the contract issues because the gist of the contract claim is Drywood's and PDI's failure to provide technical information prior to 
plaintiff's termination. Thus, it is defendants' conduct in providing encouragement, assistance and incentive to withhold technical 
information, not the termination letter, that provides the source of their liability on the contract and tort claims. HN25[
] - "
562,14," HN36[
] Del Code tit. 8 § 144(a) (1983) provides: (a) No contract or transaction between a corporation and 1 or more of its directors or officers, or between a corporation and 
any other corporation, partnership, association, or other organization in which 1 or more of its directors or officers are 
directors or officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the "
563,," director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the board or committee which authorizes the contract or 
transaction, or solely because his or their votes are counted for such purpose, if: (1) The material facts as to his relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to 
the board of directors or the committee, and the board or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by 
the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a 
quorum; or (2) The material facts as to his relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to 
the shareholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the 
shareholders; or (3) The contract or transaction is fair as to the corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the board 
of directors, a committee or the shareholders. "
565,15," Defendants' claim for declaratory relief, PDI et al. Answer at 17-18, must also be denied. HN41[
] When ruling on equitable 
claims, the court is bound by the jury's relevant findings on the legal claims.  Florists' Nationwide Telephone Delivery Network v. 
Florists Telegraph Delivery Ass'n, 371 F.2d 263, 271 (7th Cir. 1967). It would be wholly inconsistent with the jury's finding in this 
case to grant defendants PDI et al. the declaratory relief which they request. Moreover, granting declaratory relief would serve 
no useful purpose at this stage because the legal obligations of the parties have been clarified by the jury's resolution of the 
legal claims. See Maryland Casualty Co. v. Rosen, 445 F.2d 1012, 1014 (2d Cir. 1971). Accordingly, we deny defendants' claim 
for declaratory relief. "
575,1," In relevant part, the statute of limitations provides that HN2[
] Any action to enforce any cause of action under . . . this title shall be forever barred unless commenced within four 
years after the cause of action accrued."
575,15, U.S.C. § 15b.
575,2," In relevant part, the complaint alleges Plaintiff had no knowledge of said antitrust violations as they affected the bidding process and the award, or of any facts 
which might have led to discovery thereof at any time prior to disclosures contained in Cleveland Press articles in 1977, 
which disclosed the business and personal relationships between the defendants. Defendants deceptively secured the 
appointment of defendants, SEMINOLE and PLANTS as management consultants to the City of Cleveland through the 
influence of defendant SEAWRIGHT, a close friend and business associate of defendant, PLANTS. SEAWRIGHT was at 
the same time a distributor for defendant, PEABODY GALION. Defendants, SEMINOLE and PLANTS, thereafter tailored 
the specifications which they recommended to the City of Cleveland to fit defendant PEABODY GALION'S equipment and, 
indeed, defendant, PEABODY GALION did, in fact, draft the specifications. For their roles in the award of this contract, 
defendants, SEMINOLE, SEAWRIGHT and PLANTS, were indicted by a Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Grand Jury and 
entered pleas of guilty - SEMINOLE to having an unlawful interest in a public contract; PLANTS to attempt and having an 
unlawful interest in a public contract; and SEAWRIGHT to attempt and complicity. As a result, plaintiff, by the exercise of 
due diligence, did not discover, and could not have discovered, the violations alleged herein prior to 1977. Complaint at para. 17. "
577,3," For excellent discussions of the developing law of fraudulent concealment and the relationship of the Bailey decision to that 
development, see Note, ""The Application of the Doctrine of Fraudulent Concealment to Modern Federal Trade Conspiracy 
Cases,""  14 Conn. L. Rev. 115 (1981); Note, ""Intent to Conceal: Tolling the Antitrust Statute of Limitations under the Fraudulent 
Concealment Doctrine,""  64 Geo. L.J. 791 (1976)."
577,4," The best argument raised in opposition to acceptance of a self concealing conspiracy exception to the requirement of showing 
affirmative conduct appears in Hall. In that case, the court stated that It is in the nature of a conspiracy that there be secrecy; mere non-disclosure or denial of the existence of a conspiracy does 
not constitute fraud or deceit for tolling purposes. If it did, the tolling exception to the statute of limitation would eclipse the 
basic statute itself."
577,312," F. Supp. at 362. This Court does not agree with the Hall Court's analysis. A self-concealing conspiracy exception will not 
significantly affect the availability of a fraudulent concealment exception to the statute of limitations. Plaintiffs who claim 
fraudulent concealment must still demonstrate that they remained ignorant of the existence of the conspiracy and that they 
exercised due diligence in attempting to discover the conspiracy. These additional requirements will prevent the exception from 
overwhelming the rule as the Hall court feared. Further, the federal antitrust statute of limitations relates to a range of potential antitrust claims beyond § 1 conspiracies. In those 
situations, where the existence of a conspiracy is not an issue with regards to merits of the claim, a self-concealing conspiracy 
theory might not apply. In the situation of a § 1 claim, however, a successful self-concealing conspiracy leaves plaintiff ignorant 
of one element of its cause of action. In contrast, in a monopolization claim, for example, the existence of a successful self-
concealing conspiracy does not necessarily mean that plaintiff is ignorant of all the facts giving rise to its cause of action. "
579,5," The cases cited by Peabody,  Benoit v. Burlington Industries, Inc., 1975 Trade Cases para. 60,160 (S.D. N.Y. 1975); and  
Rutledge v. Boston Woven Hose and Rubber Co., 576 F.2d 248 (9th Cir. 1978), do not require the opposite result. While both 
cases involve the filing of a second antitrust lawsuit by a plaintiff arising out of a single transaction, both of these cases are 
distinguishable. In Benoit, the Court found that all of the facts giving rise to the second lawsuit should have been discovered by plaintiff within the 
original period of limitations. There was no credible evidence, unlike this case, that plaintiff could have remained ignorant of its 
rights while exercising due diligence in pursuing its claims in the first case. Rutledge involved a second antitrust suit involving almost identical parties. In Rutledge, where a conspiracy was in issue in both 
antitrust claims, the Court rejected plaintiff's claims of due diligence when he failed to discover any conspiracy in the first action. 
In this case, however, conspiracy was not an element of the claims presented in the first lawsuit. "
580,6," The terms antitrust injury and antitrust standing are used almost interchangeably in this area of the law. In essence, antitrust 
injury is the element which is added to traditional notions of standing to produce antitrust standing. For ease of reference, the 
Court will phrase its discussion of these terms as ""antitrust standing."""
580,7," The term ""antitrust standing"" is distinct from traditional concepts of ""standing."" Recently, the Supreme Court discussed this 
distinction, stating: the label ""antitrust standing"" has traditionally been applied to some of the elements of this inquiry. As commentators have 
observed, the focus of the doctrine of ""antitrust standing"" is somewhat different from that of standing as a constitutional 
doctrine. Harm to the antitrust plaintiff is sufficient to satisfy the constitutional standing requirement of injury in fact, but the 
Court must make a further determination of whether the plaintiff is a proper party to bring a private antitrust action. Associated General Contractors of California, Inc. v. California State Counsel of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 103 S. Ct. 897, 907 
n.31, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983) (citation omitted)."
580,8," The failure of the McCready, AGCC, and Southaven courts to discuss injury-in-fact does not remove this inquiry from the 
analysis. Those courts focused their attention upon the conceptually more difficult issues relating to the second part of the test. 
Under these circumstances, their failure to specifically address injury-in-fact is not significant. "
581,9," Buddie's claim of injury-in-fact also requires a finding that Buddie would have profited from receiving the contract award. As 
such, calculation of Buddie's damages will require at least some conjecture. The issue of whether this calculation is too 
speculative to support an award of damages, however, has not been raised in this context in the summary judgment motion. The 
Court, therefore, reserves decision on this issue."
581,10," Public contracting law generally limits a court's review of a contracting authority's award to an abuse of discretion standard. 
Those cases, however, arise in a different factual context than this antitrust claim. Neither party has briefed the issue of the 
appropriate standard of review in the context of this summary judgment motion. The Court, therefore, reserves decision on this 
issue."
581,11," In fairness to the parties, the Court acknowledges that the summary judgment motions were briefed prior to the decisions in 
the AGCC and Southaven cases. "
582,12, The relevant geographic and product markets are discussed later in this opinion. See infra at slip op. pp. 35-36.
582,13," For a related discussion, see note 9 supra. "
583,14," The Southaven and AGCC courts also supported their denials of antitrust standing to plaintiffs because the plaintiffs' claims 
were ""remedial under other laws.""  Southaven, 715 F.2d at 1088,  AGCC, 103 S. Ct. at 911. In this case, Buddie has an 
arguable tort claim for intentional interference with business relationships. While Buddie could pursue this action in state court, it 
is not as clearly preferable to a federal antitrust claim as the matters discussed in Southaven or AGCC. Under this analysis, and 
considering the limited role given this factor by the Southaven and AGCC courts, the Court finds the existence of other remedies 
is not a significant factor in the analysis. "
584,15," Ordinarily, analysis of a restraint begins with a consideration of whether the challenged restraint is subject to analysis under 
the per se rule, a position advanced by Buddie citing  City of Atlanta v. Ashland Warren, Inc., 1982-1 Trade Cases P 64,527 
(N.D.Ga. 1981). Based on the current state of the pleadings, however, the Court believes that it need not consider the 
applicability of per se analysis at this stage of the litigation. The Court expressly reserves decision on the issue of whether the 
challenged restraint should be analyzed under the per se rule. "
589,16," In relevant part, the exceptions provide: Although an issue is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and the determination is essential to 
the judgment, relitigation of the issue in a subsequent action between the parties is not precluded in the following 
circumstances: (1) The party against whom preclusion is sought could not, as a matter of law, have obtained review of the judgment in the 
initial action; or (2) The issue is one of law and (a) the two actions involve claims that are substantially unrelated, or (b) a new 
determination is warranted in order to take account of an intervening change in the applicable legal context or otherwise to 
avoid inequitable administration of the laws; or (3) A new determination of the issue is warranted by differences in the quality or extensiveness of the procedures followed 
in the two courts or by factors relating to the allocation of jurisdiction between them; or (4) The party against whom preclusion is sought had a significantly heavier burden of persuasion with respect to the issue 
in the initial action than in the subsequent action; the burden has shifted to his adversary; or the adversary has a 
significantly heavier burden than he had in the first action; or (5) There is a clear and convincing need for a new determination of the issue (a) because of the potential adverse impact of 
the determination on the public interest or the interests of persons not themselves parties in the initial action, (b) because it 
was not sufficiently foreseeable at the time of the initial action that the issue would arise in the context of a subsequent 
action, or (c) because the party sought to be precluded, as a result of the conduct of his adversary or other special 
circumstances, did not have an adequate opportunity or incentive to obtain a full and fair adjudication in the initial action. Id. "
590,17," The trial judge incorporated the opinion of the Court into the judgment entry by stating that ""the Court's further findings of fact 
are set forth in its written opinion filed in these proceedings."""
590,18," While the indictments do not specifically refer to the contract for the solid waste treatment plant, the documents attached to the 
file clearly indicate that the indictments arise out of this transaction. "
591,19," The Court notes that the presence of an antitrust conspiracy was not, and in fact could not have been, an issue in the state 
court action.  Buddie is attempting to prove an antitrust conspiracy without demonstrating ""collusion among bidders."" Likewise, 
the conspiracy alleged in this case was not presented to the state court because Seawright, Plants, and Seminole were not 
parties to the state court litigation. Finally, the Court concludes that a finding of an absence of collusion among bidders under the 
public contract laws does not necessarily forecloses a finding of conspiracy under the antitrust laws."
591,20," Another basis for denying collateral estoppel effect to the Buddie I court's determination on the collateral estoppel issue is its 
apparent conflict with the guilty pleas in the common pleas court action. Under the Restatement (Second), When in two actions inconsistent final judgments are rendered, it is the later, not the earlier, judgment that is accorded 
conclusive effect in the third action under the rules of res judicata. Id. at § 15. Assuming that the guilty pleas by Seawright and Plants conflict with the finding of no collusion made by the Buddie I 
court, this rule applies to preclude granting any collateral estoppel effect to the Buddie I court's findings on collusion."
591,21," Under any concept of collateral estoppel, Buddie is not precluded from relitigating an issue unless the ""determination was 
essential to the judgment."" Ohio law limits judicial review of a contract award to an abuse of discretion standard. The finding that 
Buddie's bid was defective, therefore, was not an essential finding to support the Buddie I court's affirmance of the City's award. "
592,22," As noted before, the Court has reserved decision on the standard it will use in reviewing the City's decision to award the 
contract to Peabody. See note 10, supra. Under these circumstances, the Court believes that summary judgment on this issue is 
inappropriate at this time. "
598,1," It is worth noting that Congress knew how to use this word, in this statute, when it wished to. "
600,2," While, as I have noted, the allegations presented in this case are wide-ranging and complex, and the pleadings to date indicate 
that the parties are prepared for a long siege, the issues of fact are relatively straightforward questions involving the credibility of 
a few major participants.  Now the plaintiff has filed an amended complaint.  It contains the original complaint's allegations, with 
a few minor  changes, and some new allegations as well.These new allegations are based on the discovery and are included in 
the amended complaint under a separate heading entitled ""Testimony To Date."" Because the information revealed by that 
testimony is not integrated into the body of the original complaint, but is simply tacked on to the end of that complaint's factual "
601,," allegations, the amended complaint does little to clarify the plaintiff's claims.  Although the amended complaint features an 
expanded cast of character, and a few new mysterious subplot twists, its message is the same as that of the original complaint.  
Essentially, each contends that the defendants diverted a corporate opportunity and used the profits obtained thereby to buy 
57.3% of Technographics.  The defendants have filed a motion to dismiss, a lengthy memorandum in support thereof (which 
does little more than repeat the arguments the defendants made in their earlier memorandum), and appendix, the purpose of 
which is to point out that it perceives to be misstatements of fact and which, it turns out, is as long and about as helpful to the 
resolution of this case as the Boston telephone directory.  I have reviewed this material and hopefully, this note will abort the 
plaintiff's anticipated lengthy response.  Because the theme of the new complaint is substantially the same as that of the original 
complaint, I conclude, that it too states a cause of action under RICO and Rule 10b-5.  But, as the defendants correctly point out, 
it is not verified, and is subject to dismisssal.  I do not believe it would be fruitful to dismiss this new complaint at this time, 
however.  The plaintiff apparently intends to amend his complaint from time to time as new evidence is discovered.  Given the 
length of each complaint, and the weight of the defendants' responses to them, the road that looms ahead is forbidding, not only 
because of its threat to America's forests and to the structural soundness of the Courthouse, but also because of the effect it will 
have on the market price of Xerox stock. Consequently, I think it best to take the following course.  Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 16, 
and in response to the motion for Rule 16 conference, parties are to complete all discovery within six months of this order.  
Counsel are to confer and agree on a schedule for discovery. When discovery is completed, the plaintiff is directed to file a 
single amended complaint that sets his claim out plainly and concisely. The defendant may respond, if so inclined, in a single 
pleading.  The case will be called for status conference in January, 1984, and scheduled for trial in the spring of 1985. Counsel shoudl also consider whether the issues addressed in this opinion -- specifically, the RICO issues -- involve controlling 
questions of law as to which there is substantial ground for differences of opinion, so that an immediate appeal may materially 
advance the ultimate termination of the litigation. "
605,1," HN2[
] Section 1962 (c) provides that it shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which 
affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's 
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt."
605,2," ""HN3[
] Racketeering activity"" is defined as, inter alia, ""any act which is indictable under any of the following provisions of title"
605,18," , United States Code: * * * section 1341 (relating to mail fraud), section 1343 (relating to wire fraud) * * *."" 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (1) 
(B)."
605,3," A ""pattern of racketeering activity"" is defined as ""at least two acts of racketeering activity * * the last of which occurred within 
ten years * * after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity."" 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (5)."
605,4," ""Enterprise"" includes ""any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of 
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity."" 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (4)."
605,5," HN4[
]  18 U.S.C. § 1964 (c) provides a civil remedy to ""any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 * *."" "
606,6," See supra note 1.  We do observe that Grant's original complaint alleges that Tiffany is both a ""person"" and an ""enterprise"" 
within the meaning of section 1962 (c).  It was precisely because of the possibility of such an identity that we held that count II of 
the complaint in Bennett v. Berg, 685 F.2d 1053, 1061-62 (8th Cir. 1982), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 710 F.2d 1361 (8th Cir. 
1983) (en banc), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1008, 104 S. Ct. 527, 78 L. Ed. 2d 710 (1983), failed to state a claim.  Tiffany does not 
raise this point on appeal.  We note, however, that Grant's amended complaint alleges that, in addition to Tiffany, two other 
distinct ""enterprises"" existed.  The first consists of an association in fact of the six named individuals alleged in the amended 
complaint to have participated in the fraud.  The second consists of all Tiffany employees."
606,7," See supra note 5.  The term ""indirect injury"" discussed in Cenco has also been used as a synonym for the ""commercial"" or 
""competitive"" injury requirement.  See, e.g., Schacht v. Brown, 711 F.2d 1343, 1356-58 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1002, 
104 S. Ct. 509, 78 L. Ed. 2d 698 (1983). It has been suggested that this requirement, borrowed from antitrust law, is applicable 
to RICO because the statute's legislative history reveals that it was ""intended in part to combat the threat posed by racketeer 
influences in the free market system."" Bennett, 685 F.2d at 1059. We explicitly rejected in Bennett any ""commercial"" or 
""competitive"" injury restriction on standing under RICO.  Id.  See also Blakey, The RICO Civil Fraud Action in Context: 
Reflections on Bennett v. Berg, 58 Notre Dame L. Rev. 237, 255 n.52 (1982)."
606,8," Appellee Kahn argues separately that Grant's injury is insufficient because it was not a victim in the ""target area"" of the alleged 
RICO violation.  He asserts that this concept, derived from standing tests developed under section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 
U.S.C. § 15 (1982), is applicable to RICO plaintiffs.  Recognizing that we declined in Bennett an invitation to apply antitrust 
standing restrictions to RICO plaintiffs, see supra note 7, Kahn does not argue that Grant satisfies the target area test only if it 
suffers ""commercial"" or ""competitive"" injury.  Rather, Kahn asserts that Grant must ""loan Tiffany money, buy its stock or 
otherwise extend economic benefits to [it] * * *"" to have standing.  Appellee's Brief at 20.  We believe that this reasoning is 
simply an alternative means of characterizing Grant's injury as ""indirect,"" and therefore feel it merits no analysis independent of 
our discussion of Cenco."
606,9, The particular language in Cenco is as follows: 
607,," It is presumably on behalf of the owners, perhaps also the customers and competitors, of such businesses that the civil 
damages remedy was created, and not on behalf of the people who supply office equipment or financial or legal services to 
criminal enterprises that may be violating RICO.  It is unlikely that Congress if it had adverted to the issue would have 
chosen to create in the wake of every RICO violation waves of treble-damage suits by all who may have suffered indirectly 
from the violation, especially when many of these would inevitably be, as here, the witting or unwitting tools of the violator."
607,686, F.2d at 457.
607,10," In Sutliff, Judge Posner made the following observation in the context of rejecting an organized crime connection for civil RICO 
recovery: Congress deliberately cast the net of liability wide, being more concerned to avoid opening loopholes through which the 
minions of organized crime might crawl to freedom than to avoid making garden-variety frauds actionable in federal treble-
damage proceedings -- the price of eliminating all possible loopholes.  We must abide by Congress's decision, made at a 
time of less sensitivity than today to the workload pressures on the federal courts and to the desirability of maintaining a 
reasonable balance between state and federal courts, however much we may regret not only the burdens that the decision 
has cast on the federal courts but also the displacement of state tort law into the federal courts that it has brought about. "
607,727, F.2d at 654 (citations omitted).  Sutliff does not refer to the Cenco decision. 
608,11," Sedima also holds that a prior criminal conviction is a prerequisite to civil RICO recovery.  This issue has not been raised in 
the district court in this case. "
613,1," The others are Southwestern Investors, Inc., Southwestern Investors Income Fund, Inc., and Fund of the Southwest, Inc. There 
is no claim, however, that these companies were involved in Hood's termination."
613,2," Later, in response to a letter from Hood's attorney, Southwestern Life stated that Hood's termination was due to the ""fact that 
he was placing the majority of his business with another life insurance company and had ceased to be a representative primarily 
for Southwestern Life Insurance Company. . . . Simply stated, Mr. Hood had, by his actions, ceased to be a career agent for 
Southwestern Life, and our notice of termination merely confirmed that point."" Hood's contract with Southwestern Life provided it could be terminated at any time by either party on written notice to the other."
613,3," One reason offered for this policy is that, under the rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, an individual may 
work as a registered representative for only one company. The premise is that individuals leaving Southwestern Life would wish 
to become a representative of a securities firm associated with another life insurance company. "
614,4," Before its acquisition by Copperweld, Regal Tube was an unincorporated division of Lear Siegler, Inc. Grohne served as 
president of this division."
614,5," For example, they sent to parties with whom Grohne was attempting to deal a letter warning of their intent to protect their rights 
under the terms of their purchase agreement and to protect the trade secrets purchased from Lear Siegler. After receiving this 
letter, Yoder Company canceled a contract with Grohne under which the former was to supply a tubing mill. Copperweld and 
Regal Tube also contacted banks that were considering financing the new company as well as prospective suppliers and 
customers of Independence Tube."
614,6, The Court reserved the question of whether a parent company may conspire with an affiliated company it does not wholly own. 
615,7," Thus, we do not directly address the merits of Hood's federal claim, as such, apart from the Copperweld rule, although, as 
shown by the discussion of his state law claim, the result would be the same."
615,8," The district court had jurisdiction over this pendent state claim. See Transource International v. Trinity Industries, Inc., 725 F.2d 
274, 285-86 (5th Cir.1984)."

616,10," Supporting this conclusion is the fact that the wording of article 21.21, section 4(4), while differing from that of section 1 of the 
Sherman Act, is quite similar to the wording in the McCarran-Ferguson Act. HN9[
] This act generally exempts the insurance industry from regulation under the federal antitrust laws including the Sherman Act. 15 U.S.C. § 1012(b). There is an exception 
to this general exemption: the Sherman Act remains applicable ""to any agreement to boycott, coerce, or intimidate, or act of 
boycott, coercion, or intimidation."" 15 U.S.C. § 1013(b). This Court has analyzed claims of boycotts by insurance companies 
under the test applied for violations of section 1 of the Sherman Act. Blackburn v. Crum & Forster, 611 F.2d 102 (5th Cir.), cert. 
denied, 447 U.S. 906, 100 S. Ct. 2989, 64 L. Ed. 2d 856 (1980). See also St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co. v. Barry, 438 U.S.

] Horizontal agreements are ordinarily considered illegal per se ""' because of their pernicious effect on competition 
and lack of any redeeming virtue.'"" Transource, 725 F.2d at 279, quoting Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 
5, 78 S. Ct. 514, 518, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958). Where a per se violation has occurred, the plaintiff is not required to show any 
anticompetitive effects; these are presumed. Id."
616,12," From January to September 1980 Hood earned $7,168 in commissions for new business from Southwestern Life; his first 
year's commissions with all other companies totaled $36,851 during this same time period.  His earnings for renewals from 
January to September were $6,530 and $9,480 respectively. Hood had voluntarily moved from the Southwestern Life branch 
office in Beaumont in June 1980 because he was placing much of his business with other companies. "
617,13," Thus we reject Hood's contention, made during oral argument, that the two companies competed because each offered 
products relevant to financial planning and security."
617,14," Nor is there any other basis for finding a per se violation. See E.A. McQuade Tours, Inc. v. Consolidated Air Tour Manual 
Committee, 467 F.2d 178 (5th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1109, 93 S. Ct. 912, 34 L. Ed. 2d 690 (1973)."
617,15, Both Hood and his expert witness testified that the life insurance business in the Beaumont area was intensely competitive.
617,16," The record reflects that Southwestern Life's overall share of ordinary life insurance in Texas at this time was 2.33 percent; its 
share of group insurance in that state was.67 percent."

response to price changes . . . and the ability of other existing producers or new entrants to expand output . . . ."" Hornsby Oil, 
714 F.2d at 1393. "
623,1," The implications of recent Supreme Court decisions in this area have provoked much scholarly discussion.  See e.g., Posner, 
The Proper Relationship between State Regulation and the Federal Antitrust Laws, 49 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 693 (1974); Slater, 
Antitrust and Government Action: A Formula for Narrowing Parker v. Brown, 69 Nw. U.L. Rev. 71 (1974); Rogers, Municipal 
Antitrust Liability in a Federalist System, 1980 Ariz. St. L.J. 305; Areeda, Antitrust Immunity for State Action After Lafayette, 95 
Harv. L. Rev. 435 (1981); Civiletti, The Fallout from Communications Co. v. City of Boulder, 32 Cath. U.L. Rev. 379 (1983). 
These decisions have also given rise to much litigation presenting serious and unsettled questions.  See e.g., Town of Hallie v. 
City of Eau Claire, 700 F.2d 376 (7th Cir. 1983), cert. granted, 467 U.S. 1240, 104 S. Ct. 3508, 82 L. Ed. 2d 818, 52 U.S.L.W.

petition for cert. filed, 52 U.S.L.W. 3441 (U.S. Nov. 18, 1983) (No. 83-825). "
624,2," Two other sections of the Agreement provide: H.  The LGA will not establish, construct or operate nor consent to the establishment, construction or operation of any 
facility for the disposal or other treatment of Solid Waste which is acceptable for disposal by the Project, and further, to the 
extent legally permissible, it will oppose the establishment, construction or operation of such a facility.  The LGA System 
shall not charge to or collect from the Project. . . . O. . . . The LGA shall use its best efforts to establish rates and charges for the disposal of Solid Waste through the Project 
at a level which assures an adequate supply of Solid Waste for the purpose of the Project and, subject to the foregoing, 
shall be comparable with competitive charges for such services. . . ."
624,3," Section 1(a) of the ordinance provides: Until such time as the City's recycle energy plant begins accepting rubbish for disposal, no rubbish shall be deposited by 
the Holder of a rubbish bailer's license within the corporate limits of the City except at a place designated in writing by the 
Mayor. From and after the date on which such plant begins accepting rubbish for disposal, all rubbish collected within the 
corporate limits of the City by a holder of a rubbish hauler's license shall be deposited at such plant; provided that rubbish 
which is not acceptable for disposal by such plant shall not be deposited within the City except at a place designated by the 
Mayor. Section 2 provides: No person, except duly authorized collectors of the City or private haulers licensed pursuant to law, shall collect or remove 
any garbage or rubbish accumulating within the City or use the streets, avenues and alleys of the City for the purpose of 
collecting or transporting the same.  All licenses granted to such private haulers and all contracts or other forms of 
authorization of duly authorized collectors shall require that all garbage or rubbish collected and transported under authority "
625,," for disposal by the City's energy plant, be disposed of at such plant from and after the date on which such plant begins 
accepting garbage and rubbish for disposal. "
626,4," ""In the years since the decision in Parker, the Court has had occasion in several cases to determine the scope of the state 
action doctrine.  It has never departed, however, from Parker's basic reasoning."" Hoover v. Ronwin, 466 U.S. 558, 104 S. Ct. 
1989, 1995, 80 L. Ed. 2d 590 (1984). "

(""It is difficult for us to apply the Lafayette decision since the plurality and dissenting opinions are each supported by four 
justices, and no line of reasoning commands a majority of the Court.""). "
628,6," ""Because we conclude in the present case that Boulder's moratorium ordinance does not satisfy the 'clear articulation and 
affirmative expression ' criterion, we do not reach the question whether that ordinance must or could satisfy the 'active state 
supervision ' test focused upon in Midcal."" City of Boulder, 455 U.S. at 51 n.14."
628,7," The Boulder decision could have a sweeping impact on the assertion of legislative authority by municipalities. Thirty-five states 
have made provisions for home-rule powers either through legislation or through their constitutions.  Note, Community 
Communications Co. v. City of Boulder, 31 De Paul L. Rev. 819, 821 (1982)."
628,8,"  Although the Lafayette requirement of state authorization clearly applies to cities and other subordinate local units, its 
application to state agencies is uncertain.  On the one hand, the majority's belief that ""authorization"" helps ensure that 
governmental activity is truly state action could logically be extended to state executive departments and administrative 
agencies.  On the other hand, Justice Brennan's reasoning was predicated on the existence of a large number of 
municipalities and other subordinate governmental units, each pursuing parochial and perhaps conflicting policies.  Their 
ordinances are locally formulated, with a possible anticompetitive impact beyond city or district limits . . .  State agencies, by 
contract, formulate statewide rules and policies.  Areeda, Antitrust Immunity for ""State Action"" After Lafayette, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 435, 444 (1981). "
630,9," We noted this problem in Gambrel v. Kentucky Bd. of Dentistry, 689 F.2d 612 (6th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1208, 103 
S. Ct. 1198, 75 L. Ed. 2d 441 (1983). Because we believe the meaning of the statute in this case is clear and unambiguous, we need not decide a more subtle 
question, namely whether the interpretation of an ambiguous or open-ended regulatory statute by a state agency can ever 
constitute ""state action"" in and of itself under the Parker v. Brown doctrine.  Certainly the first part of the Midcal Aluminum 
test, whether the challenged restraint is ""clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy,"" at a minimum 
covers state policy explicitly declared in a statute.  However, state regulatory statutes are often drafted in general terms and 
delegate broad policymaking discretion to a state regulatory agency.  The result is administrative policymaking, either by 
authorized rulemaking or by enforcement practices. "
630,689, F.2d at 619 n. 3. 
631,10," For example, in Town of Hallie v. City of Eau Claire, 700 F.2d 376, 383 (7th Cir. 1983), cert. granted, 467 U.S. 1240, 104 S. 
Ct. 3508, 82 L. Ed. 2d 818, 52 U.S.L.W. 3891, (1984), the court upheld the exemption for a municipality that conditioned 
extension of sewer service on annexation.  A state statute expressly provided that extension of sewer services could be refused 
if an adjoining area elected not be become annexed.  In Gambrel v. Kentucky Bd. of Dentistry, 689 F.2d 612, 619 (6th Cir. 
1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1208, 103 S. Ct. 1198, 75 L. Ed. 2d 441 (1983), this court applied the exemption to protect a 
restraint on denture products where the challenged conduct was ""compelled by the statute itself."""
631,11," Similarly, state law authorizing a medical society to investigate charges of willful overcharging by physicians will not extend to 
justify society's efforts to enforce price-fixing.  Ratino v. Medical Service of Dist. of Columbia, 718 F.2d 1260, 1268 (4th Cir.

58 L. Ed. 2d 424, 99 S. Ct. 454 (1978)."
632,13," Professor Areeda, in an article prior to Boulder, writes: Lafayette does not require that governmental acts be ""compelled"" or supervised by the state.  Rather, it demands that the 
legislature have authorized the challenged activity with an intent to displace the antitrust laws. Unfortunately, state statutes 
seldom speak with clarity on either matter.  In practice, therefore, express statements of authority or intent cannot be 
required.  The Supreme Court has found it sufficient that ""the legislature contemplated the kind of action complained of."" A 
policy to displace the antitrust laws will then be inferred if the challenged restraint of competition is a necessary or 
reasonable consequence of engaging in the authorized activity.  Areeda, Antitrust Immunity for ""State Action"" After Lafayette, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 435, 445-46 (1981). See also P. Areeda, Antitrust 
Law, para. 212.3 (Supp. 1981)."

Cir. 1983), petition for cert. filed, 52 U.S.L.W. 3039 (U.S. July 25, 1983) (No. 83-138), the court considered a challenge to a city's 
decision to grant a contract for exclusive ambulance services within the city to a single operator.  The court held that a ""sufficient 
state policy to displace competition exists if the challenged restraint is a necessary or reasonable consequence of engaging in 
the authorized activity."" State law permitted the city to contract with ""one or more"" ambulance operators.  The court held that the 
city's actions were protected by the exemption because monopoly service is ""the necessary consequence of having only one 
municipal ambulance operator."" 705 F.2d at 1013. Accord First American Title Co. v. South Dakota Land Title Ass'n, 714 F.2d

settlement discussions with officers of Brown & Sharpe took place without the presence of joint counsel on several occasions.  In 
the late spring or summer of 1980, Jackson met with Richard Duncan, Brown & Sharpe's Treasurer, at the offices of Brown & 
Sharpe in Rhode Island.  At that meeting, Duncan refused plaintiff's demand of $350,000.  In February of 1981, plaintiff made a 
demand of $500,000; this offer expired without acceptance.  On June 25, 1981, plaintiff and Jackson met with James Hayes, in 
house counsel for Brown & Sharpe, in New York.  At that meeting, Hayes offered $15,000 and plaintiff refused.  Subsequent 
discussions did not produce a settlement; but even during the Claims Court trial, Jackson was told by Kidd to contact Hayes if he 
wanted to discuss settlement with Brown & Sharpe. Plaintiff's settlement discussions with Bendix after the appearance of Pennie & Edmonds are set out in Exhibit A to Bendix's

641,," settlement discussions with Kenneth Seaman, in house counsel for Bendix, took place without the presence of joint counsel on 
numerous occasions.  As a result of these discussions, a meeting between plaintiff and officers of Bendix was held in New York 
without counsel for either side in attendance.  That meeting failed to produce a settlement; however, even during the Claims 
Court trial, Jackson was told by Kidd to contact H. G. Massung, in house counsel for Bendix, if he wanted to discuss settlement 
with Bendix."
641,3," That decision is now on appeal before the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  Oral argument before the Federal Circuit 
was held on March 6, 1984 and the parties now await a decision by that Court."
641,4," At this point in the litigation, plaintiff primarily relies on the following facts to establish his claim of conspiracy: (1) the December 
7, 1979 meeting of defendants in which they agreed that ""a strong unified approach against Mr. Lemelson is mandatory""; (2) the 
government attorney's comments during a March 25, 1980 telephone conversation that plaintiff would face a ""united front""; (3) 
the March, 1980, appearance of Pennie & Edmonds as joint counsel and Kidd's objection, by letter dated April 7, 1980, to direct 
discussions between Jackson and defendants; and (4) various occasions on which settlement information relating to one 
defendant was exchanged or made known to the other defendant.  See Plaintiff's Supplemental Memorandum in Support of His 
Motion to Compel at 3-6 (Dkt. No. 164)."
641,5," Some courts have required that the prima facie showing be based on evidence exclusive of the disputed documents 
themselves, see, e.g., United States v. Shewfelt, 455 F.2d 836, 840 (9th Cir. 1972); Kockums Industries v. Salem Equipment, 
561 F. Supp. 168, 171 (D.Or. 1983), while other courts have considered both the independent evidence and the disputed 
documents in determining whether a prima facie case has been shown, see, e.g., In re Berkley Co., 629 F.2d 548, 553 (8th Cir. "
642,1980," ). The Court does not need to resolve that issue here since, under either standard, plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a 
prima facie case. In fact, the disputed documents submitted to the Court for in camera inspection lend further support to 
defendant's position that no conspiracy or refusal to negotiate independently with plaintiff ever existed.  Therefore, even 
assuming arguendo that the Court should consider the disputed documents themselves in determining whether plaintiff has 
established a prima facie case, plaintiff has not satisfied his burden of proof."
642,6," The Court notes that plaintiff has made no showing at all with respect to this requirement of the crime/fraud exception. 
Moreover, the Court is convinced, after carefully viewing the documents in camera, that none of the documents were prepared in 
furtherance of the alleged conspiracy to violate the antitrust laws. Instead, the documents were prepared in order to effectively 
litigate the Claims Court action."
642,7," As stated in Gould v. Control Laser Corp. [1978-2 TRADE CASES P62,385], 462 F. Supp. 685, 692-93 (M.D.Fla. 1978), aff'd., 
650 F.2d 617 (5th Cir. 1981): ""HN4[
] Unless [plaintiff] can prove that each participating member of the group agreed, as 
alleged, not to recognize the validity of the patent and not to accept licensing except upon terms approved by the group, 
[plaintiff's antitrust] claim must fail."" The crucial inquiry is whether plaintiff has produced evidence of an agreement among 
defendants which had the effect of restraining individual freedom of action and preventing settlement negotiations or licensing 
except upon terms acceptable to the group. "
643,8," The fact that defendants exchanged settlement information can be viewed as evidence that defendants were aware of each 
other's actions and therefore engaged in consciously parallel business behavior.  However, the Third Circuit has consistently 
held that HN6[
] proof of consciously parallel business behavior, without more, is insufficient evidence of an agreement in 
violation of the antitrust laws unless the circumstances under which the parallel behavior occurred make the inference of rational 
independent choice less attractive than that of concerted action.  These circumstances include a showing of acts by defendants 
in contradition of their own economic interests and satisfactory demonstration of a motivation to enter an agreement.  See 
Edward J. Sweeney & Sons, Inc. v. Texaco, Inc., 637 F.2d 105, 114 (3d Cir. 1980); Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp., 561 F.2d 434, 
446 (3d Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1086, 98 S. Ct. 1280, 55 L. Ed. 2d 791 (1978); Venzie Corp. v. United States Mineral 
Products, 521 F.2d 1309, 1314 (3d Cir. 1975). Here, while both defendants determined to refuse to take a license from plaintiff 
and could thus be found to have engaged in parallel business behavior, there is nothing to suggest that defendants acted 
against their independent economic interests in refusing to settle or that defendants had any motive or reason to limit their 
individual freedom by agreeing to refuse to deal with plaintiff.  In this situation, the inference that defendants independently 
refused to settle is much more plausible than an inference that their refusal was the result of concerted action.  Therefore, the 
Court concludes that, absent proof that defendants' actions were against their independent economic interests, the exchange of 
settlement information is insufficient to permit an inference of conspiracy. "
648,1," Raytheon and RSC will, for convenience's sake, be referred to jointly as ""Raytheon."""
648,2," Two other defendants were voluntarily dismissed under Fed. R. Civ.  Pro. 41(a): Dean E. Bensley and Metropolitan District 
Council of Philadelphia and Vicinity, United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America. Docket Item (""Dkt."") 93. "
649,3," See James Julian, Inc. v. Raytheon Co., 557 F. Supp. 1058 (D. Del. 1983); James Julian, Inc. v. Raytheon Co., 499 F. Supp. 
949 (D. Del. 1980); James Julian, Inc. v. Raytheon Co., 93 F.R.D. 138 (D.Del. 1982)."
649,4," Counts II, IV and V were limited to claims against the non-union defendants who are no longer parties to this action."
649,5," Section 8(b)(4) makes it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization, inter alia, to threaten, coerce, or restrain any person engaged in commerce or in any industry affecting commerce, where . . . an object 
thereof is -- (A) forcing or requiring any employer . . . to enter into any agreement which is prohibited by [section 8(e)]; (B) forcing or requiring any person . . . to cease doing business with any other person. . . ."
649,29, U.S.C. § 158(b)(4). 
651,6," Although the prior opinion focused on the Iron Workers' involvement in a conspiracy with the other unions rather than on the 
role played by Raytheon in the alleged conspiracy, the briefing did contend that no conspiracy with non-labor parties existed. 
See Opening Brief of Defendants Iron Workers and Peterson in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment, Dkt. 112 at 8; Reply 
Brief of Defendants Iron Workers and Peterson in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment, Dkt. 121 at 14-15. Thus, despite 
defense counsel's contention to the contrary at oral argument, see Transcript of June 12, 1984, Hearing, Dkt. 161, at 59-60, the 
issue of Raytheon's involvement in the alleged conspiracy was not raised for the first time in the pending motions."
651,7," They also argue that Julian needs ""clear proof"" that statements by various individuals were authorized or ratified by each 
defendant and needs ""hard evidence"" of a conspiracy. Those are not, however, appropriate summary judgment standards. 
There is significant probative evidence tending to show that the union defendants acted jointly in furtherance of a common goal. 
See Minutes of November 16, 1978 Business Agents Meeting, Dkt. 157, at A-370 (describing ""Raytheon Problem"" and ""possible 
meeting tomorrow with Operating Engineers, Wharf and Dock Builders and Raytheon""); Deposition of James Au, Dkt. 157, at A-
421-A-422 (describing job site encounter with John McCrae, Business Manager and President of Wharf and Dock Builders, Joe 
O'Donoghue, Business Manager of Local 542, and Al Spanich, President of Local 542); Deposition of James Au, Dkt. 157, at A-
466 (describing picketing in October 1979 as a ""combination of all the Building Trades Council""); Minutes of December 17, 1979 
Special Business Agents Meeting, Dkt. 157, at 371 (describing President DiMauro's report on ""present status of developments at 
Pigeon Point Landfill Project""). "
652,8," Evidence that seeds of conspiracy were planted at the November 8, 1978, meeting include a memorandum by Robert J. 
Storella, RSC's Senior Contract Administrator, which states, in part: a. Since the present pile testing is almost completed anyway, the Operating Engineers will not insist on replacing the 4 
""non-union"" workers with union operators provided that Raytheon assures the Building and Trades that 100% union 
personnel (i.e. Building and Trades) will be used when the job itself is actually started. b. They want our answer by this Friday (11/10). If it is not a favorable reply, the Operating Engineers and the Dock Workers 
will put up a picket line at the site on Monday morning. c. We told them we would give them our answer by Friday. Dkt. 157, at A-307. Storella later explained that RSC ""required Julian to utilize a Building Trades Contractor, Raymond 
International, to drive piles rather than his own work force,"" and described this move as ""a concession to achieve labor peace 
based on threats of a picket."" Letter from Robert J. Storella to N. C. Vasuki, June 27, 1979, Dkt. 157, at A-324.  Evidence further 
shows that Theodore W. Ryan, President of the Trades Council, knew of the contract modification giving Raymond the pile work 
through conversations with Vasuki, Contract Officer at the Delaware Solid Waste Authority. See Deposition of T. Ryan at 76-77, 
Dkt. 157, at 534-335. With respect to Julian's ultimate termination, there is further evidence of conspiracy. Evidence shows that Jacob Kreshtool, an 
attorney for the Operating Engineers, told Vasuki in late October, 1979, that he would file suit challenging an Authority bond 
issue but that the suit would be dropped if the entire project were given to Building Trade workers. See November 1, 1974, 
Memorandum from J. J. Mahon to E. L. Kane, Dkt. 157, at A-348.  Furthermore, on December 5, 1979, Dean Bensley, RSC's 
President, wrote to Vasuki and explained that he had been ""in direct contact with Mr. DiMauro,"" and had told DiMauro that RSC 
considered the Building Trades ""as potential allies on this project."" Dkt. 157, at A-350. Although this evidence is merely 
circumstantial, and although it is far from convincing, the Court cannot conclude that it is neither significant nor probative of a 
conspiracy. HN9[
] -"
652,9," Justice Douglas dissented specifically on the grounds that no conspiracy was alleged because Connell ""maintained only that 
Local 100 coerced it into signing the subcontracting agreement."" Connell, 421 U.S. at 638 (Douglas, J., dissenting). The concept of a coerced agreement violating antitrust law is not peculiar to the labor arena. It has long been held that group 
boycotts and vertical price restraints imposed by a manufacturers or suppliers on their retailers through threats or coercion may 
constitute ""agreements"" subject to antitrust attack. See, e.g., Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 104 S. Ct. at 1471 & 
n.10. Altemose, where no evidence of an agreement existed, is fully consistent with this rule. "
653,10," Professor Areeda, commenting on Muko I, argues that it is ""strange to extract treble damages from the victim of lawful union 
pressure who had no choice but to acquiesce in the union's demands if he wished to survive."" P. Areeda, Antitrust Law para. 
229.2a, at 83 (Supp. 1982). He nonetheless recognizes the existence of a contrary argument, similar to that raised in the Conex 
case, that ""antitrust liability would stiffen the resistance of the victim so as to discourage the union from exerting the pressure."" 
Id."
653,11," The outer limits of the exemption were delineated by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Muko I: An agreement between a union and a business organization, outside a collective bargaining relationship, which imposes a 
direct restraint upon a business market, and which is not justified by congressional labor policy because it has actual or 
potential anticompetitive effects that would not flow naturally from the elimination of competition over wages and working 
conditions, is not exempt from antitrust scrutiny. Muko I, 609 F.2d at 1373. "
654,12," HN13[
] Section 8(e) provides in part: It shall be an unfair labor practice for any labor organization and any employer to enter into any contract or agreement, 
express or implied, whereby such employer ceases or refrains or agrees to cease or refrain from handling, using, selling, 
transporting or otherwise dealing in any of the products of any other employer, or to cease doing business with any other 
person, and any contract or agreement entered into heretofore or hereafter containing such an agreement shall be to such 
extent unenforceable and void: Provided, That nothing in this subsection shall apply to an agreement between a labor 
organization and an employer in the construction industry relating to the contracting or subcontracting of work to be done at 
the site of the construction, alteration, painting, or repair of a building, structure, or other work. . . ."
654,29," U.S.C. § 158(e). Agreements protected by the construction industry proviso to section 8(e) are also protected from antitrust liability. See Kaiser 
Steel Corp. v. Mullins, 455 U.S. 72, 85, 70 L. Ed. 2d 833, 102 S. Ct. 851 (1982); Altemose, slip op. at 43-44 & n.67. "
655,13," This case does not involve a dispute, outside the collective bargaining context, involving ""shoulder-to-shoulder"" friction 
between union and non-union workers. See James Julian, 499 F. Supp. at 957; Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Associated 
Builders & Contractors, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 654 F.2d 1301, 1319-21 (9th Cir. 1981) (en banc), aff'd sub nom, Woelke & Romero, 
456 U.S. 645, 72 L. Ed. 2d 398, 102 S. Ct. 2071 (Connell presents alternative requirements of either a collective bargaining 
relationship or a threat of shoulder-to-shoulder friction with non-union workers). Rather, it involves a territorial dispute between 
workers represented by different unions, not the type of ""shoulder-to-shoulder"" friction described by the Supreme Court in 
Connell or Woelke & Ramero. "
656,14," The Third Circuit's brief one-sentence summary of the non-statutory exemption in Feather which indicated that ""generally"" a 
predatory purpose is required, Feather, 711 F.2d at 542, cannot be read as overruling the extensive interpretation of Connell 
contained in Conex and reaffirmed in Muko II."
656,15," The Conex court created a defense in damage actions, not available in declaratory judgment or injunctive actions, for cases in 
which the defendant ""could not reasonably have foreseen that the subject matter of the agreement being challenged would be 
held to be unlawful under § 8(b) (4) or § 8(e)"" and where the agreement was ""'intimately related' to the object of collective 
bargaining thought at the time to be legitimate, and went no further in imposing restraints in the secondary market than was 
reasonably necessary to accomplish it."" Conex, 602 F.2d at 521; see also Feather, 711 F.2d at 542. The availability of this 
defense is an issue which must be litigated at trial."
656,16," Defendants have ignored entirely plaintiff's Sherman Act section 2 claim. To the extent plaintiff alleges an attempt to 
monopolize, effect on the market place is irrelevant (although probable effect is very relevant). See United States v. Columbia 
Steel Co., 334 U.S. 495, 531-32, 92 L. Ed. 1533, 68 S. Ct. 1107 (1948) (reasonable restraint of trade not in violation of section 1 
may nonetheless constitute an attempt to monopolize under section 2); Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 375, 396, 49 L. 
Ed. 518, 25 S. Ct. 276 (1905) (attempt to monopolize claim needs proof of intent and dangerous probability of success)."
656,17," Nor does a finding that the agreement violates section 8(e) per se make the agreement illegal.  Muko II, 670 F.2d at 427 n.5. "
657,18," Earlier language in Conex had suggested that conduct which stripped a union of its antitrust exemption would necessarily 
constitute an antitrust violation, see Conex, 602 F.2d at 523-24, but Muko II limited the holding of Conex as applying to a case 
involving a classic group boycott. Muko II, 670 F.2d at 427."
657,19," It may be a case in which one union attempts to cut another union from the marketplace, but plaintiffs wisely have not 
suggested that such action would lose the protection of Clayton Act sections 6 and 20."
657,20," While this case is distinguishable from Muko II as involving a termination of an existing contract, that distinction, alone, is 
insufficient to make defendants' alleged actions per se illegal under the antitrust laws."
657,21," If the Trades Council unions had sought solely to substitute themselves as Julian's employees in place of the Steel Workers, 
that effort would not constitute an antitrust violation because it would not have lead to a net increase in restraint of trade over 
that created by the existing arrangement between Julian and the Steel Workers. See Jou-Jou Designs v. International Ladies 
Garment Workers Union, 643 F.2d 905, 910 (2d Cir. 1981). Evidence supports Julian's theory, however, that the unions forced 
Julian off the project site, thus affecting competition beyond the substitution in a collective bargaining relationship of one group of 
employees for another. "
658,22," Section 8(b)(4) prohibits only picketing for ""secondary"" objectives, not ""primary"" objectives. See National Woodwork 
Manufacturers Association v. NLRB, 386 U.S. 612, 619-33, 18 L. Ed. 2d 357, 87 S. Ct. 1250 (1967). Area standards picketing 
would not involve an unlawful objective, while picketing to force one party to cease doing business with another would. See id."
658,23, The parties have not briefed the state tort law question of vicarious tort liability under a conspiracy or agency theory. 
659,*," Upon consideration of the petition for rehearing with suggestion for rehearing en banc, filed by the appellee, a majority of the 
panel has voted to deny rehearing, and a majority of the judges of the court in active service has voted not to rehear the case en 
banc; the petition is therefore DENIED.  Judge Swygert of the panel voted to rehear the case.  Judge Wood's position is as 
follows: ""Judge Wood voted to grant en banc consideration of the original majority opinion, but takes no position with regard to 
the amended opinion from which Judge Swygert again dissents as the amended opinion and dissent have not been seen or 
considered by the parties."" Judge Coffey joins in Judge Wood's comment. The panel majority and dissenting opinions have been amended with regard to the standard of judicial review of orders granting 
or denying preliminary injunctions.  The amended opinions are issued herewith and supersede the original opinions issued on 
August 31, 1984. "
683,1," Anyone who disagrees with this proposition should attempt the formulation of suitable, comprehensible jury instructions for a 
case with nine parties, eight federal counts, and eight state counts. "
685,2, This reasoning is equally applicable to the Land Sales Act counts disposed of supra. 
686,3," The determination whether a prior criminal conviction is a prerequisite to a civil RICO recovery was left open in the recent case 
of Alexander Grant and Company v. Tiffany Industries, Inc., 742 F.2d 408 (8th Cir.1984). "
689,1," Land O'Lakes, Inc., G. Heileman Brewing Co., Inc., Grist Mill Co., Beatrice Foods Co., Cumberland Farm Dairies, Inc. and

689,3," Cumberland Farm Dairies, Inc. and Pantry Pride Enterprises, Inc."
689,4," The last distribution to late claimants was apparently on May 27, 1982."
689,5," For a comprehensive discussion of this subject, see Developments in the Law -- Class Actions, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 1318, 1516-
1536 (1976); for refusal to utilize the analogous concept of creative sentencing in the criminal field, see United States v. Wright 
Contracting Co., 728 F.2d 648, 650-653 (4th Cir. 1984), where the court of appeals overturned district court orders requiring 
defendants to contribute substantial sums to private charitable organizations. "
690,6, Some of the cases cited in the dissent are thus accurate in stating that the escheat to the United States is not permanent.
690,7," The Supreme Court decision addressing state escheat cited by the dissent, Texas v. New Jersey, 379 U.S. 674, 13 L. Ed. 2d 
596, 85 S. Ct. 626 (1965) did not involve property in dispute under federal law and therefore the role of the United States as a 
depositary under 28 U.S.C. § 2042 was not implicated.  That case does not inject state parens patriae principles into matters 
solely within federal jurisdiction.  Here the fund arose out of defendants' alleged violations of the federal antitrust laws. None of 
the cases relied upon in the dissent involves a situation comparable to the present one, so that this opinion is not in conflict with 
other cases involving 28 U.S.C. §§ 2041 and 2042."
690,8," Avery International Corp., Handschy Chemicals, Inc., John C. Gilmore, Textor Corporation and Zachary Confections, Inc. "
691,9," All arguments presented by the litigants have been fully considered.  Most of them were properly rejected in the opinion below. 
Those not covered there or in this opinion do not merit discussion."
691,1," It may be that the United States may forfeit funds deposited into the Treasury under section 2042 where a statute gives the 
government a right to assert a beneficial interest or ownership of the funds.  See United States v. Iovenelli, 403 F.2d 468 (7th 
Cir. 1968) (government may have right to money used to bribe federal agent, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3612); In re Escheat of 
Monies Deposited, 187 F.2d 131 (3d Cir. 1951) (same).  See also United States v. Farrell, 196 U.S. App. D.C. 434, 606 F.2d 
1341, 1344-45 & n.7 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (summary of statutory forfeiture).  The United States may also assert a reversionary 
interest in unclaimed funds where such reversion is permitted by statute. See 38 U.S.C. § 3202(e) (any funds of deceased 
veteran derived from federal veterans' benefits paid to decedent that would escheat to state shall escheat to United States).  
One court has noted that although § 3202(e) uses the term ""escheat,"" the statute actually permits reversion, not escheat. In re 
Estate of Novotny, 446 F. Supp. 1027, 1031-35 (S.D.N.Y. 1978). Here, there is no statute allowing the federal government to 
assert a beneficial interest in damages in a private antitrust action. "
692,2," Prior to the decision in American Loan & Trust Co., the statute did not permit claimants to petition for return of their money.  
Following the decision, the statute was amended to its present form.  See Act of March 3, 1911, c. 224, 96 Stat. 1083.  Thus, the 
issue of the constitutionality of a permanent escheat to the United States has not arisen since the 1911 amendment.  See In re 
Moneys Deposited, 243 F.2d 443 (3d Cir. 1957)."
692,3," This is the purpose behind both the fluid recovery and cy pres theories.  See Newberg, Class Actions § 7570 (1977). "
693,4," The theory of the state as parens patriae is used in the antitrust class action context in three distinct senses. First, it refers to 
the traditional power of the state to protect those of its citizens who cannot protect themselves, by collecting their unclaimed 
property. Second, it refers to attempts by states to extend their traditional power and sue on behalf of their citizens allegedly 
injured.  Third, it refers to attempts by states to sue for alleged injury to the general economy of the state itself.  In this case, I 
refer to parens patriae only in its first sense. "
694,5," Some states have a provision in their escheat statute permitting the owner of the property to reclaim the property after escheat. 
See Uniform Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act § 19; see, e.g., Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 141, § 119. "
697,1," It does not follow from this that Congress intended to import all of the peculiar rules of antitrust law into RICO, see, e.g., In re 
Longhorn Securities Litigation, 573 F. Supp. 255, 270 (W.D. Okla.1983). Indeed, RICO's legislative history makes this quite 
clear. E.g., 115 Cong.Rec. 9567 (1969) (statement of Sen. McClellan)."
697,2," Section 4 provides: ""Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust 
laws . . .  shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 15. "
698,3," There is a strong argument that supports the court's decision in Caton, based on the facts. See id. at 682. However, it simply 
does not apply here. "
704,1," See Gonzales v. Harris, 514 F. Supp. 991 (E.D. Cal. 1981). "
705,2," R & K's original motion was entitled ""Motion to Dismiss Amended Complaint."" It is based on Fed.R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2), (6). It 
should be noted that R & K was named in the First Amended Complaint for the first time. R & K's original motion was denied. R 
& K then filed the instant motion for summary judgment. "
708,3," See the Court's comments concerning the Chambers in-house memorandum, supra, which analysis is equally relevant here."
708,4," The Court adopts a ""compartmentalized"" approach to this motion."
708,5," We have already dealt with the claim of conspiracy between Chambers and R & K. (See part I, supra.) "
722,1," The government's challenge to the merger also involved WMI and Waste Resources' subsidiaries in Houston.  Judge Griesa 
upheld the merger so far as the Houston companies were concerned, and no appeal was taken.  We thus address only the 
legality of the acquisition of TIDI."
722,2," As mentioned supra, WMI had a second subsidiary, Texas Waste Management, in the Dallas geographic market.  The 
government offered no market share data for Texas Waste Management, and the district court did not consider it in its 
determination of market share. Since the government failed to carry its burden on this issue, we also decline to consider Texas 
Waste Management's share. "
724,3," We reject WMI's contention that the district court violated its due process rights by defining a market against which it had no 
opportunity to defend.  Since appellant argued at trial that every waste hauler should be included in the market definition, it 
plainly responded to all less inclusive alternatives.  To the minor extent that the district court deviated from an analysis of 
equipment-based distinctions as debated by the parties, that deviation was to appellant's advantage.  By including in the market 
all business/industrial customers, even those that use non-containerized equipment, the court diluted appellant's market share 
by counting the revenues that Dallas and other municipalities receive from business establishments. "
726,4," Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18 (1982) provides in relevant part: HN7[
] No person engaged in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the 
whole or any part of the stock or other share capital and no person subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade 
Commission shall acquire the whole or any part of the assets of another person engaged also in commerce or in any 
activity affecting commerce, where in any line of commerce or in any activity affecting commerce in any section of the 
country, the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly. "
730,1," Another of Conn's business entities, the Upstairs Corporation, has already been dismissed from this action because its 
corporate status had been suspended by state authorities, and it therefore lacked capacity to sue. The defendants have now 
moved for summary judgment against Western Shoe Gallery, Inc. on the same ground; Western Shoe Gallery's corporate status 
was suspended on April 2, 1984. The defendants' motion is denied on this issue, however, because Conn has shown that the 
corporate status of Western Shoe Gallery, Inc. was reinstated as of July 27, 1984. Throughout this opinion, the plaintiffs are 
referred to simply as ""Conn"" because it is clear that the defendants did not distinguish between the various entities controlled by 
Mr. Conn. "
731,2," The defendants have also argued that Conn's equitable claims are barred by laches. We need not decide this claim, however, 
because Conn stated at oral argument that he had abandoned his claims for equitable relief. "
732,3," Conn also contends that in 1980 two of the defendant tour operators demanded rebates from Conn and that certain of his 
employees did authorize such payments for a limited period of time. The evidence on this issue, however, consists only of 
Conn's answers to the defendants' interrogatories; these answers were verified by Mr. Conn, but only on information and belief. 
The court cannot consider this evidence because it does not meet the requirements of rule 56(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure. S & S Logging Co. v. Barker, 366 F.2d 617, 624 n.7 (9th Cir. 1966). "
733,4," The short and cryptic opinion in the Orgell case can conceivably be read to hold that a concerted refusal to deal is always final 
from its inception. The Orgell court did not explain why the later offers were ""forlorn inquiries by one all of whose reasonable 
hopes had been previously dashed;"" this contrasts sharply with the approach of the Air Pollution court, which justified its 
conclusion by reference to the characteristics of the automobile original equipment supply market. Moreover, the Poster 
Exchange case, upon which Air Pollution was based, clearly rejected the argument that a concerted refusal to deal is always 
final from its inception. Indeed, the Poster Exchange court explicitly assumed that any new refusal to deal ordinarily would 
constitute a new overt act giving rise to a new cause of action. 517 F.2d at 128-29. For this reason, the Air Pollution court found 
it necessary to explain why the new refusal to deal in that case merely responded to a ""forlorn inquiry"" and did not give rise to a 
new cause of action. This court therefore declines to adopt the interpretation of Orgell suggested above. Without a clear 
statement from the Ninth Circuit, we will not adopt such a rigid rule, which goes well beyond Air Pollution and Poster Exchange, 
and which conflicts with the basic premise that ""each time a plaintiff is injured by an act of the defendants a cause of action 
accrues to him to recover the damages caused by that act. . . ."" Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 401 U.S. 321, 
338, 28 L. Ed. 2d 77, 91 S. Ct. 795 (1971)."
733,5," The applicable limitations period for Conn's HN5[
] state law antitrust claims is also four years. Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§"
733,16750," .1 & 16755. HN6[
] A three year statute of limitations governs Conn's claims under the California Unfair Practices Act. Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17000-101. See Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 338(1). Conn's HN7[
] state common law claims are governed by a two year statute of limitations. Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 339(1). The parties have not addressed, and the court does "
734,," not decide, whether the continuing violation rationale of Zenith, Poster Exchange, and Air Pollution applies to Conn's state law 
claims. "
745,1," We recognize that statistics concerning market share and concentration are not conclusive indicators of anticompetitive effects, 
but they provide a meaningful context within which to address the question of the merger's competitive effects. See United 
States v. General Dynamics Corp., 415 U.S. 486, 498, 39 L. Ed. 2d 530, 94 S. Ct. 1186 (1974). "
754,1," The granting of a motion for new trial is subject to a less stringent standard.  The trial court may order a new trial if it believes 
the jury's verdict is clearly against the weight of the evidence and we may reverse that decision only if we find it to be an abuse 
of discretion.  Janich Bros., Inc. v. American Distilling Co., 570 F.2d 848, 1027 (9th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 829, 58 L. 
Ed. 2d 122, 99 S. Ct. 103 (1978)."
754,2," Airweld claimed that the tying arrangement violated both section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, and section 3 of the 
Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 14. This court has stated that the elements for establishing a violation under each provision are virtually 
the same.  Moore v. Jas. H. Matthews & Co., 550 F.2d 1207, 1214 (9th Cir. 1977); see In re Data General Corp. Antitrust 
Litigation, 490 F. Supp. 1089, 1100 (N.D. Cal. 1980) (the distinction has faded beyond recognition).  In our analysis, therefore, 
we treat them alike. "
756,3," Airweld also claims that the jury's verdict in Airweld's favor on the attempt to monopolize the acetylene market claim should still 
stand.  We disagree.  Attempt to monopolize will be discussed in more detail later in another context.  At this point, we need only "
757,," state that Airweld's failure to prove a substantive tying violation precludes it from claiming that Airco's actions in that respect also 
constituted an attempt to monopolize. See Foremost Pro Color, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 703 F.2d 534, 543 (9th Cir. 1983), 
cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1038, 104 S. Ct. 1315, 79 L. Ed. 2d 712 (1984). "
761,1," In Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 52 U.S.L.W. 4821, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984), 
the Supreme Court held that a parent corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are incapable of conspiring with each other "
762,," for the purposes of section 1 of the Sherman Act as section 1 does not reach conduct that is ""wholly unilateral"". Therefore, it is 
clear that plaintiff can no longer claim that Pfizer, Inc., the parent corporation, conspired with is foreign subsidiaries to violate the 
antitrust laws. However, since we find that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction on other grounds, we need not address the 
question whether plaintiff has adequately pleaded a conspiracy between Pfizer, Inc. and the non-subsidiary companies 
mentioned in the complaint."
762,2, It is not clear from the parties' papers whether plaintiff continues to sell Vibramycin in the Federal Republic of Germany. 
763,3," Even before the enactment of section 7, it was the situs of the effect which determined whether United States antitrust law 
applied to a particular transaction.  United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416, 443-44 (2d Cir. 1945) (Learned 
Hand, J.). However, in applying this rule, courts had arrived at different formulations for the nature and quantum of ""effects"" 
needed. See, e.g., National Bank of Canada v. Interbank Card Association, 666 F.2d 6, 8 (2d Cir. 1981) (any anticompetitive 
effect on either United States commerce within the United States or export commerce from the United States); Dominicus 
America Bohio v. Gulf & Western Industries, Inc., 473 F. Supp. 680, 687 (S.D.N.Y. 1979) (not necessary for the effect on foreign 
commerce to be both substantial and direct as long as it is not de minimus); Waldbaum v. Worldvision Enterprises, Inc., 1978-2 
Trade Case (CCH) P 62,378, at 76,257 (S.D.N.Y. 1978) (anticompetitive effects in the United States); Industria Sciliana Asfalti, 
Bitumi, S.P.A. v. Exxon Research & Engineering Co., 1977-1 Trade Case (CCH) Par. 61.256 at 70,784 (S.D.N.Y. 1977) (impact 
upon United States commerce); Todhunter-Mitchell & Co., Ltd. v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 383 F. Supp. 586, 587 (E.D. Pa. 1974) 
(direct effect on the flow of foreign commerce into or out of the United States). "
764,4," The objective nature of this test is evident from the use of ""reasonably"" and ""foreseeable"". The test is whether the effect would 
have been evident to a reasonable person making practical business judgments, not whether actual knowledge or intent can be 
shown. House Report at 9, reprinted in 1982 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News at 2494."
764,5," Where the conduct is solely export oriented, only domestic exporters (injured in the United States) have a remedy under the 
Sherman Act. ""But a foreign firm whose non-domestic operations were injured by the very same export oriented conduct, would 
have no remedy under our antitrust laws."" House Report at 11. "
765,6," After defendants filed their motion to dismiss, plaintiff was on full notice of the issues involved. Yet plaintiff's responding 
memorandum does not contain allegations sufficient to cure the deficiencies in the complaint. It is reasonable to assume that 
plaintiff has no further facts to allege with respect to the impact of defendants' conduct in the United States. "
769,1," The provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended, may be found at 49 U.S.C. Subtitle IV (1982).  For the Interstate 
Commerce Commission's decision, see Ex Parte No. 346 (Sub-No.7), Railroad Exemption -- Export Coal, 367 ICC 570 (1983) 
(hereinafter cited as Decision)."
769,2," Pub. L. No. 96-448, Title II, § 213, 94 STAT. 1912 (1980). "
770,3," The exemption provision, in relevant part, reads: HN1[
] In a matter related to a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce 
Commission under this subchapter, the Commission shall exempt a person, class of persons, or a transaction or service 
when the Commission finds that the application of a provision of this subtitle -- (1) is not necessary to carry out the transportation policy of section 10101a of this title; and (2) either (A) the transaction or service is of limited scope, or (B) the application of a provision of this subtitle is not needed 
to protect shippers from the abuse of market power. "
770,49," U.S.C. § 10505(a) (1982).  In this case the Commission made no finding with respect to the issue of ""limited scope,"" relying 
instead on its finding relating to ""abuse of market power."" See Decision, supra note 1, 367 ICC at 586 n.37. Section 10101a, referred to in the exemption provision, reads: In regulating the railroad industry, it is the policy of the United States Government -- (1) to allow, to the maximum extent possible, competition and the demand for services to establish reasonable rates for 
transportation by rail; (2) to minimize the need for Federal regulatory control over the rail transportation system and to require fair and expeditious 
regulatory decisions when regulation is required; (3) to promote a safe and efficient rail transportation system by allowing rail carriers to earn adequate revenues, as 
determined by the Interstate Commerce Commission; (4) to ensure the development and continuation of a sound rail transportation system with effective competition among rail 
carriers and with other modes, to meet the needs of the public and the national defense; (5) to foster sound economic conditions in transportation and to ensure effective competition and coordination between rail 
carriers and other modes; (6) to maintain reasonable rates where there is an absence of effective competition and where rail rates provide revenues 
which exceed the amount necessary to maintain the rail system and to attract capital; (7) to reduce regulatory barriers to entry into and exit from the industry; (8) to operate transportation facilities and equipment without detriment to the public health and safety; (9) to cooperate with the States on transportation matters to assure that intrastate regulatory jurisdiction is exercised in 
accordance with the standards established in this subtitle; "
771,," (10) to encourage honest and efficient management of railroads and, in particular, the elimination of noncompensatory 
rates for rail transportation; (11) to require rail carriers, to the maximum extent practicable, to rely on individual rate increases, and to limit the use of 
increases of general applicability; (12) to encourage fair wages and safe and suitable working conditions in the railroad industry; (13) to prohibit predatory pricing and practices, to avoid undue concentrations of market power and to prohibit unlawful 
discrimination; (14) to ensure the availability of accurate cost information in regulatory proceedings, while minimizing the burden on rail 
carriers of developing and maintaining the capability of providing such information; and (15) to encourage and promote energy conservation."
771,49, U.S.C. § 10101a (1982).
771,4," Petitioners have also argued that ICC's exemption decision must be vacated for failure to comply with a variety of procedural 
requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act and other laws.  Because of our disposition of the case on other grounds, we 
need reach no conclusions regarding the merits of most of these challenges.  One of these challenges, however, we shall 
examine. Petitioners contend that Commissioner Gradison, who voted in the exemption decision, was obliged to disqualify herself 
because her impartiality in this proceeding ""might reasonably be questioned."" 28 U.S.C. § 455(a) (1982).  Because 
Commissioner Gradison may choose to participate in future proceedings concerning the matters raised in this case, we will 
discuss the contention that she should have disqualified herself in this proceeding. Petitioners argued below that the Commission's Canon of Conduct, 49 C.F.R. § 1000.735-14(a) (1983), obliged Commissioner 
Gradison to disqualify herself in this case.  In relevant part that canon states: ""Members * * * shall not participate in any matter in 
which they have a substantial pecuniary interest or in which their impartiality might reasonably be questioned."" Petitioners do not 
contend that Commissioner Gradison had any pecuniary interest in the outcome of this case.  But they do contend that her 
impartiality ""might reasonably be questioned."" They point out that earlier in her career she had been an employee of the 
Southern Railway Company for eight years.  Petitioners also point out that subsequent to Gradison's resignation from Southern it 
merged with the Norfolk & Western Railway Company, which was the original proponent of the exemption at issue in this case.  
Commissioner Gradison denied petitioners' motion for disqualification and filed a detailed explanation of her reasoning.  Joint 
Appendix (JA) 177-195. We reject petitioners' contention that it was improper for Commissioner Gradison to have denied the motion for her 
disqualification.  Petitioners contend that ""her duties [at Southern] included developing a rate structure for deregulated fresh 
fruits and vegetables with a view in part to gain experience should other areas of traffic be exempted."" Reply brief of petitioners 
Coal Exporters Association of the United States, Inc. and National Coal Association (CEA/NCA) at 25 n.49.  But even if this were 
so, such an employment record in itself implies no impropriety in her fully participating in exemption cases such as this.  No 
contention is made that her prior employment experience is significant for reasons other than that it involved the Commissioner 
in a presumably partisan way in the general issues of rail carrier deregulation.  Yet even on this issue no specific evidence of a 
closed mind is given.  It is not surprising that a member of ICC has had substantial employment experience with a rail carrier. "
772,," Nor is it surprising that ICC's rulemaking proceedings may involve policies that affect many rail carriers. The fact that a 
Commissioner had in the past done work for a carrier that has involved that person in the general areas of policy that surround a 
rulemaking cannot be sufficient to prevent that Commissioner's participation in that rulemaking.  A Commissioner is not required 
to repudiate her past experiences upon assuming public office.  Prior involvement in the general public issues facing an agency 
is not in itself a basis for disqualification from agency actions concerning those issues.  Cf.  Ass'n of Nat'l Advertisers, Inc. v. 
FTC, 201 U.S. App. D.C. 165, 627 F.2d 1151 (D.C. Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 447 U.S. 921, 100 S. Ct. 3011, 65 L. Ed. 2d 1113 
(1980). See also Laird v. Tatum, 409 U.S. 824, 34 L. Ed. 2d 50, 93 S. Ct. 7 (1972) (Memorandum of Rehnquist, J.)."
772,5," Congressional findings were explicitly set out in § 2 of the Act. Among them were findings that (3) today, most transportation within the United States is competitive; (4) many of the Government regulations affecting railroads have become unnecessary and inefficient; (5) nearly two-thirds of the Nation's intercity freight is transported by modes of transportation other than railroads; (6) earnings by the railroad industry are the lowest of any transportation mode and are insufficient to generate funds for 
necessary capital improvements; (8) failure to achieve increased earnings within the railroad industry will result in either further deterioration of the rail 
system or the necessity for additional Federal subsidy; and (9) modernization of economic regulation for the railroad industry with a greater reliance on the marketplace is essential in 
order to achieve maximum utilization of railroads to save energy and combat inflation. Pub. L. No. 96-448, § 2, 94 STAT. 1896 (1980), reprinted at 49 U.S.C. § 10101a note (1982). Similarly, § 3 set out as a goal of the Act ""reform [of] Federal regulatory policy so as to preserve a safe, adequate, economical, 
efficient, and financially stable rail system[.]"" Pub. L. No. 96-448, § 3 (2), 94 STAT. 1897 (1980), reprinted at 49 U.S.C. § 10101a 
note (1982). "
773,6," The legislative history of the Act is full of descriptions of it by conference committee members, sponsors, leading proponents, 
and floor leaders as a detailed and delicate compromise that accommodated the interests of carriers, shippers, and the public, 
reducing or eliminating regulation where appropriate and preserving regulatory protection for shippers where necessary.  See, 
e.g., 126 Cong. Rec. S14005 (daily ed. Sept. 30, 1980) (comments of Sen. Exon); id. at S14003 (comments of Sen. Cannon); id. 
(comments of Sen. Long); id. at H10086-H10087 (comments of Rep. Rahall); id. at H8555-H8556 (comments of Rep. Loeffler); 
id. at H8550-H8551 (comments of Rep. Rahall). More important, this compromise nature is reflected throughout the Act.  It is most recognizable in those general policy 
provisions of the Act that speak to shipper interests.  The statement of goals includes as one of the Act's goals ""to provide a 
regulatory process that balances the needs of the carriers, shippers, and the public[.]"" Pub. L. No. 96-448, § 3(4), 94 STAT. 
1897 (1980), reprinted at 49 U.S.C. § 10101a note (1982).  Similarly, the statute's declaration of national rail policy includes such 
policies as ""to maintain reasonable rates where there is an absence of effective competition and where rail rates provide 
revenues which exceed the amount necessary to maintain the rail system and to attract capital,"" id. § 10101a (6), and ""to avoid 
undue concentrations of market power[.]"" Id. § 10101a (13).  As we discuss in text, the elements of national rail policy limit the 
Commission's exemption power, id. § 10505(a)(1), and the power is further limited where the regulation to be lifted is ""needed to 
protect shippers from the abuse of market power."" Id. § 10505(a)(2)(B)."
773,7," As the Conference Report states: The policy underlying [the exemption] provision is that while Congress has been able to identify [sic] broad areas of 
Commerce where reduced regulation is clearly warranted, the Commission is more capable through the administrative 
process of examining specific regulatory provisions and practices not yet addressed by Congress to determine where they 
can be deregulated consistent with the policies of Congress. * * * H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 96-1430, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 105 (1980)."
773,8, See note 3 supra and accompanying text. 
775,9," See also Decision, supra note 1, 367 ICC at 575 (""Coal production has now been expanded throughout the world beyond the 
reasonable ability of the current market to absorb it, and this surplus is aggravated by the current decline in the world price of oil.  
These trends ensure that there will most likely continue to be vigorous price competition in the world * * * market at least for the 
near future."" (footnote omitted))."
775,10," Petitioners did not agree that U.S. rail carriers would lack market power in the world market. For example, one brief cites 
statistics that first show that 2/3 of all U.S. coal exports are met coal and only 1/3 are steam coal. They go on to show that in 
1980 2/3 of Western Europe's met coal imports were from the U.S.  They also point out that the Department of Justice, in its 
filing to the Commission, ""stated that the U.S. 'appears to be the dominant supplier' of low and medium volatile metallurgical 
coal, and that * * 'U.S. railroads would have substantial market power' because 'N&W and CSX (Chessie) have a virtual duopoly 
on the transportation of met coal.'"" CEA/NCA brief at 32 n.*, quoting JA 639-640 (Justice Department submission to ICC).  ICC 
Chairman Taylor similarly noted: There is considerable question regarding the effectiveness of competition in the movement of metallurgical (met) coal to 
Western Europe.  The U.S. supplies 55 percent of Western European met coal and is considered the ""swing supplier."" The "
776,," major alternative suppliers, Australia (labor problems), Poland (strikes and martial law), South Africa (political unrest and 
self-imposed quotas), and the U.S.S.R. are not considered reliable substitutes for U.S. coal.  Decision, supra note 1, 367 ICC at 600 n.78 (Chairman Taylor, dissenting)."
776,11," Petitioners made an issue of what the possible uses of Midwestern coal were.  They offered evidence to show that it could not 
practicably be used as a substitute for either eastern steam coal or met coal. See note 15 infra. "
778,12," According to a study submitted to the Commission on behalf of petitioners, the two major eastern railroads had to a great 
extent divided the export market between them according to coal type.  Thus, in 1980, Norfolk & Western participated in shipping 
93% of all eastern steam coal tonnage shipped for export, while Chessie participated in 13%. Chessie participated in shipping 
81% of all met coal tonnage, while Norfolk & Western participated in 24%.  See JA 994."
778,13," It seems undisputed that the 13% figure refers to all coal produced, not just coal produced for export. See Decision, supra 
note 1, 367 ICC at 601 (Chairman Taylor, dissenting).  Petitioners submitted evidence that less than 1% of export coal is 
transported to port by truck. CEA/NCA brief at 17 & n.**. "
779,14," Both petitioners and the dissenter note that, until complaints had been filed with ICC, eastern rail carriers, to discourage use of 
barges, had charged rates on export coal going to the Ohio River that were higher than the rates charged on export coal going to 
the railroads' Atlantic port facilities: Barge transportation [thus] almost always involves a prior movement by rail, which makes the railroad indispensable to the 
water carrier's ability to carry coal. * * * [Only] because the shippers and competing barge lines had recourse under the 
Interstate Commerce Act [did] the railroads drop[] their rates to the river to the domestic level. Decision, supra note 1, 367 ICC at 601 (Chairman Taylor, dissenting)."
779,15," Although ICC did not explain its assertion that high-sulfur Midwestern coal was substitutable for other coals, Chairman Taylor 
argued that Midwestern coal ""is not of met quality and has too much sulfur for all but a small part of the steam coal export 
market."" Decision, supra note 1, 367 ICC at 602 (Chairman Taylor, dissenting).  Evidence submitted by petitioners supported 
this view.  They contended that Midwestern coal cannot be substituted for met coal because of its sulfur content and cannot 
easily be substituted for steam coal in Europe because of European air pollution requirements that focus on coal quality.  They 
argued that much of the coal exported from the Midwest is used in cement manufacture and thus is not in competition with 
higher quality steam and met coals. See CEA/NCA brief at 27 & n.* (citing studies at JA 876-878, 1130). "
780,16," In 1976 Congress enacted the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (4-R Act), Pub. L. No. 94-210, 90 
STAT. 31 (1976).  This forerunner of the Staggers Act was a significant lessening of regulation. In contrast, before 1976 ""the ICC 
was charged with general superintendence of rates for transportation by rail. A 'just and reasonable' standard controlled all rates, 
rail users could challenge the reasonableness of rates, at any time, and the Commission had authority to determine what 
constituted a just and reasonable rate in each case."" Ford Motor Co. v. ICC, 230 U.S. App. D.C. 92, 714 F.2d 1157, 1158 (D.C. 
Cir. 1983)."
780,17," See joint reply brief of petitioner Eastern Coal Transportation Conference and intervenor-petitioner Coastal States Energy 
Company at 14 (""Far more probative is the record from 1976 to 1981 when, utilizing new rate freedoms granted by the 4-R Act, 
carrier rates on export metallurgical coal rose by 59.5%.  During the same period, minehead prices for the same product 
declined by almost 9%."" (emphasis in original)). "
781,18," The Commission was correct in this assertion.  The Conference Report makes clear that even where there is no effective 
competition constraining railroad market power an exemption may be proper if there will nevertheless be no abuse of market 
power.  The kinds of situations envisioned, however, are not clear.  The only one alluded to in the report is where other federal 
remedies would assure that market power will not be abused.  See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 96-1430, supra note 7, at 105 (""The bill 
permits exemptions wherever regulation is not needed to prevent abuses of market power, regardless of the presence of 
effective competition. * * * The conferees anticipate that through the exemption process the Commission will eventually reduce 
its exercise of authority to instances where regulation is necessary to protect against abuses of market power where other 
federal remedies are inadequate for this purpose.""). "
782,19," See also Decision, supra note 1, 367 ICC at 587-588: Exemption will free the railroads to maximize their revenues by pricing on the basis of market demand and each mine's 
long-run marginal cost (including a return on cost of capital).  By charging some of their more price-sensitive mines a lower 
rate and keeping them in the market, the railroads will be able to increase their revenue above what they would realize by 
increasing prices uniformly, as they have done in the past. (Footnote omitted.)"
782,20," Our discussion of price discrimination and our citation to antitrust law texts is, of course, not meant to imply that ICC's 
understanding of ""effective competition"" must ""strictly conform"" to antitrust law standards.  See S. Conf. Rep. No. 94-595, 94th 
Cong., 2d Sess. 148 (1976) (""While the absence of effective competition test is not intended to strictly conform [sic] with the 
standards of the antitrust laws, it is intended that when the Commission administers the test it will recognize the absence of 
forces which normally govern competitive markets."") (report on the 4-R Act). We also note that ICC's discussion of such competitive factors as geographic, intramodal, and intermodal competition did not 
attempt to analyze or define the degree to which these forces could actually provide shippers and receivers with substantial 
enough quantities of sufficiently substitutable goods or services at competitively practical prices.  The absence of such relatively 
specific inquiries would seem to be another factor indicating that ""effective competition"" was not found.  See Market Dominance 
Determinations and Consideration of Product Competition, 365 ICC 118, 132-135 (1981). What the Commission clearly did argue in its opinion was that market forces did establish ""substantial"" constraints on railroad 
behavior.  But that is not in conflict with the existence of monopoly power. As a leading economics text explains, all firms, even 
the pur monopolist -- an entity which rarely exists in the real world -- are subject to limits established by market forces.  The 
issue is how effective are the limits. "
783,," The policies adopted by a pure monopolist are affected by certain indirect and potential forms of competition.  Clearly, the 
monopolist is not completely insulated from the effects of actions taken in the rest of the economy.  All commodities are 
rivals for the consumer's favor * * *.  Clearly this rivalry occurs among different products, as well as among the producers of 
a given commodity.  For example, meat competes in this sense with butter, eggs, and even men's suits.  Of course, the 
extent of the competition from other products depends on the extent to which other products are substitutes for the 
monopolist's product.  For example, even if a firm somehow could obtain a monopoly on the supply of steel in a particular 
market, it would still face considerable competition from producers of aluminum, plastics, and other materials that are 
reasonably good substitutes for steel. E. MANSFIELD, MICROECONOMICS: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS 281 (3d ed. 1979). Nor is there a conflict between ICC's predictions of future exercise of railroad monopoly power and its descriptions of past pricing 
behavior as being restrained by ""the play of market forces."" Decision, supra note 1, 367 ICC at 581. A close reading of its 
discussion of past pricing reveals that it states only that past behavior ""is not the kind of behavior which we think characterizes 
entities exercising unrestrained market power."" Id. at 580 (emphasis added). "
784,21," ""Effective competition"" is not only the standard for rate protection contained in § 10101a(6).  It is also the standard in the rate 
provisions themselves.  The Staggers Act withdrew ICC jurisdiction to regulate the rates of carriers who do not have ""market 
dominance"" over the relevant shipper. 49 U.S.C. § 10709(c) (1982).  ""Market dominance"" was defined as ""an absence of 
effective competition from other carriers or modes of transportation, for the traffic or movement to which a rate applies."" Id. § 
10709(a).  As we have said, the agency made no explicit or implicit finding of ""effective competition."""
784,22," Although the reference discussed in text was the only reference to § 10101a(6), the failure to discuss the section explicitly is 
not in itself fatal.  But the Commission must nonetheless offer reasoning that assures this court that § 10101a(6)'s protection was 
properly considered and applied. The national transportation policy must guide the ICC in all its decisions.  However, the ICC need not explicitly discuss in its 
decision each factor enumerated * * *.  All that is necessary is that the essential basis of the ICC's rationale be clear 
enough so that a court can satisfy itself that the ICC has performed its function. * * *  Alamo Express, Inc. v. ICC, 673 F.2d 852, 860 (5th Cir.1982) (citations omitted). An explanation of the exemption's conformity with the rate reasonableness policy is especially important here, where petitioners 
throughout their participation below emphasized their concerns for rate reasonableness and submitted substantial amounts of 
evidence to support their contention that rates will not be reasonable after exemption. "
786,23," Although the agency announced a standard concerning the ""abuse of market power"" provision, it did little to explain, in terms 
of the statute's language, structure, or history, why the concerns for protecting shippers from carrier monopoly power were met 
by that standard.  In light of this absence of explanation, we note ""that the limit placed on the judicial role by an agency's 
interpretation of a statute 'assumes an adequately articulated administrative decision interpreting the relevant statutory law within 
a range of reasonableness.'"" Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District v. FERC, 235 U.S. App. D.C. 79, 730 F.2d 1509, 
1517 (D.C. Cir. 1984), quoting Obremski v. OPM, 226 U.S. App. D.C. 111, 699 F.2d 1263, 1269 (D.C. Cir. 1983); see also FEC 
v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, 454 U.S. 27, 37, 70 L. Ed. 2d 23, 102 S. Ct. 38 (1981) (""the thoroughness, 
validity, and consistency of an agency's reasoning are factors that bear upon the amount of deference to be given an agency's 
ruling""). "
787,24," Just as the drafters were concerned with such equitable concerns regarding captive shippers, they were also concerned with 
disproportionately burdening, as a class, the shippers of any particular captive commodity.  Thus the Act requires rate 
reasonableness determinations to include consideration of ""the carrier's mix of rail traffic to determine whether one commodity is 
paying an unreasonable share of the carrier's overall revenues."" 49 U.S.C. § 10707a(e)(2)(C)(iii) (1982). "
794,1," The specific issue before the IAP court was whether plaintiffs, instead of meeting defendant's motion for summary judgment, 
could dismiss their complaint with prejudice to themselves and without costs, but without prejudice to members of a purported 
class of plaintiffs which they attempted to have certified.  517 F. Supp. at 263-65. The court determined, inter alia, that since 
defendant had gone to great expense and trouble to prepare its motion for summary judgment, and plaintiffs had never met that 
motion as required by the Rules of Civil Procedure, defendant's motion for summary judgment would be granted.  Id. at 269-70. 
The court's discussion of the nature of plaintiffs' claim and the Pick ""exception"" was therefore unnecessary in deciding the issue 
before it. "
795,2," For a more detailed discussion of MBNA's operational structure and parts distribution system, see this court's opinion in United 
States v. Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc., 517 F. Supp. 1369, 1373-74 (N.D. Cal. 1981)."
795,3," This case deals only with replacement parts. It is not argued nor could it be that parts for original use are separate products. 
Furthermore plaintiff's claim does not involve warranty parts. (Pl.'s Mem. Supp. Summ.  Judgment, at 48; Pl.'s Reply Mem., at 
23)."
795,4," Daimler-Benz A.G., the manufacturer of Mercedes automobiles, trucks, and other vehicles, and their replacement parts."
795,5," Daimler-Benz of North America, Inc., the exclusive United States importer of DBAG products. "
796,6," These cases, California Glazed Products, Inc. v. Burns & Russell Co., 708 F.2d 1423 (9th Cir.) cert. denied, 464 U.S. 938, 104 
S. Ct. 348, 78 L. Ed. 2d 314 (1983); Klamath-Lake Pharmaceutical Ass'n v. Klamath Medical Service Bureau, 701 F.2d 1276 
(9th Cir.) cert. denied, 464 U.S. 822, 104 S. Ct. 88, 78 L. Ed. 2d 96 (1983); Hamro v. Shell Oil Co., 674 F.2d 784 (9th Cir. 1982); 
and Krehl v. Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream Co., 664 F.2d 1348 (9th Cir. 1982) all consider whether the products involved in the 
alleged tying arrangements were ""separate products,"" not whether a per se standard applied. These cases are therefore 
discussed, infra, in the ""separate products"" section."
796,7," Justice O'Connor argued forcefully that tie-ins have economic utility. However, she could persuade only three other members of 
the Court to join her. In her rationale she relied in part on the reasoning of Justice White in Fortner Enterprises, Inc. v. United 
States Steel Corp., 394 U.S. 495, 22 L. Ed. 2d 495, 89 S. Ct. 1252 (1969) (""Fortner I"").  Justice White, however, joined with the 
Hyde majority in upholding the per se rule."
796,8," Defendant's reading of the Court's opinion is based largely on the concurring opinion of Justice O'Connor, which, although 
MBNA disagrees, clearly is at fundamental variance with the opinion of the Court regarding the continued validity of per se 
analysis. See, 104 S. Ct. at 1569, 1576 (O'Connor, J., concurring). "
797,9," See, note 1, supra. "
798,10," The court in Moore I also noted that the seller of the tying product should have an economic interest in the tied product.  550 
F.2d at 1216. MBNA clearly has an economic interest in the allegedly tied replacement parts.  MBNA, 517 F. Supp. at 1378 n.10. "
799,11," Defendant makes much of the argument that since a Mercedes franchise is a ""distribution"" franchise rather than a ""business 
format"" franchise, Krehl and the other franchise cases apply to this litigation.  As has been clearly demonstrated, Mercedes 
passenger cars and their replacement parts are separate products; these arguments about the format of the franchise aid MBNA 
not at all with respect to the sales of replacement parts. "
800,12," Defendant argues that Siegel is an ""odd-ball"" case that is a singular exception to the rule established in the 
franchise/trademark cases. Siegel cannot be dismissed so easily. The Supreme Court saw fit to treat Siegel approvingly in Hyde 
when the Court included it in an enumeration of cases consistent with its two-product analysis.  104 S. Ct. at 1563 n.35. The tied 
products in that case were clearly not central to the purpose for which the franchise had been established, and thus were part of 
an illegal tie-in. The replacement parts at issue in this case are also not central to the purpose of the Mercedes franchise. If other 
elements are demonstrated, they also may be shown to be part of an illegal tie. "
801,13, This provision was added to the Agreement in 1983.
801,14," The fact that MBNA earlier considered and then rejected a less restrictive version of Paragraph 9C indicates that the provision 
was not intended to be without effect. See, ""Business Justification"" section, supra."
801,15," MBNA officials still appear to consider parts ""necessary to the mechanical operation"" of the Mercedes car to include virtually 
the entire car. E.g. (Stoehr Dep. at 249-54, Pl.'s App. II). "
802,16," Defendant argues that since plaintiff in its damage study admits that BMW imposed no tying arrangement on its dealers, and 
BMW has in its dealer agreement a provision similar to Paragraph 9C, plaintiff in effect admits that MBNA is not acting in 
restraint of trade. (Def.'s Brief Supp. Summ. Judgment, at 4, 12, 13, 23, 24, 37). This argument misconstrues the import of the 
damage study and plaintiff's use of it. The damage study deals specifically with impact, something that is not at issue in this proceeding. The study took as an 
assumption the belief of the former officers of Eurasian Automotive Parts that ""whereas MBNA was coercing the Mercedes-Benz 
dealers to eliminate outside purchases, and insisting that the dealers had agreed not to buy except from MBNA and that they 
honor their agreement 'or else,' BMW employees were not coercing the BMW dealers."" (Pl.'s Brief Opp. Summ. Judgment, at 30-
31). The provision in the BMW agreement is thus of no import in analyzing whether MBNA's products are tied together."
802,17," Plaintiff also attempts to argue that the market dominance test is also met here, since the market for the tying product, the 
Mercedes-Benz passenger car, consists of the Mercedes dealers. (Pl.'s Reply Brief, at 22-23). This argument misconstrues the 
nature of the market dominance test. See, Digidyne, 734 F.2d at 1336, 1340 (9th Cir. 1984). "
803,18," Plaintiff bases this argument on portions of the extensive deposition and documentary evidence generated by this litigation, 
mostly on the deposition testimony of MBNA officials. See, (Pl.'s Mem. Supp. Summ.  Judgment, at 12-24). "
804,19," See (Terian Dep., Def.'s App. IX, at 1313-15). "
805,20," Defendant also makes much of the argument that a private plaintiff, as opposed to the government, is somehow required, 
even in a per se case, to prove the entire case, including damages, in order to prevail on any point, and cannot therefore move 
for partial summary judgment. This argument is without substance. HN13[
] Relevant authority makes it clear that the per se 
standard is not different for private and government suits. E.g., Hyde, 104 S. Ct. at 1556-61; Digidyne, 734 F.2d at 1338, 1339. "
806,21," Plaintiff argues that the Magnusson-Moss Warranty, Federal Trade Commission Act of 1974, 15 U.S.C. §§ 2301 et seq., 
especially § 2302(c), is ""clear demonstration of Congressional intent that tying arrangements cannot be justified on the ground of 
preserving goodwill."" (Pl.'s Reply Brief, at 23). It is not at all clear to the court that this statute, which prohibits a warrantor from 
conditioning the warranty on the use of a certain product, and is specifically aimed at prohibiting ""the implementation of tying 
arrangements by means of warranties"" (Pl.'s Mem.  Supp. Summ. Judgment, at 49) (quoting Harmsco, Inc., 41 Fed. Reg. 
34,368, 34,369 (1976)), destroys MBNA's interests discussed here. It is true, of course, that a tie cannot be imposed by 
Mercedes unless it demonstrates that such an arrangement is the only way the safety and quality of its product can be assured. 
If such an arrangement proves necessary, this statute would not prohibit it. See, id., at 48 (quoting House Report of § 2302(c))."
806,22," Koster suggests that it would be economically infeasible to require DBAG to monitor all the OEMs who sell on the open 
market. Id. at 1823-24.  This does not mean, however, that there are not other possible means available to insure the quality of 
the parts used in the Mercedes car.  Perhaps some quality control system could be implemented directly at the dealer level. The 
fact that the requirement of quality control poses some problems does not excuse MBNA from doing it. Additionally, Koster and 
MBNA both appear to misread the import of Volkswagenwerk A.G. v. Bundeskartellamt (the ""Federal Cartel Office""), No. KVR 
8/80 (September 11, 1981). The German court merely held that under German law, VW could not be required to monitor the "
807,," quality control processes of the OEMs. (Def.'s App. XIV, at 2123). Again, this does not dispose of the matter, for there could 
conceivably be other means of insuring the quality of replacement parts coming from OEMs. "
811,*," Hon. William J. Campbell, of the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation. "
822,1," At oral argument on pending motions, June 22, 1984, plaintiff conceded that it is not entitled to summary judgment. Prime has 
continued to pursue its own motion for summary judgment. "
823,2, The applicable provision states: 
824,," ""Dealer hereby certifies that each Prime system listed on the Prime Computer, Inc. Domestic Price List attached as 
Schedule 2 to the Dealer Agreement, purchased and licensed under the cited Dealer Agreement, is to be incorporated into 
a system consisting of Dealer application software, which Dealer then sells or leases in the regular course of its business.  
Dealer may substitute Dealer services for the requirement to add application software, and such services may be rendered 
by either the Dealer or any party in behalf of the Dealer or having a contractual relationship with the Dealer, so long as such 
services are rendered prior to sale or lease to any end user. Application software to be included in Prime Systems 
purchased hereunder is listed in Exhibit B attached hereto and made a part hereof. Additions to and deletions from the 
Exhibit B list of application software may be made from time to time subject to the prior written consent of Prime, which 
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  Dealer agrees that in no event shall Prime systems purchased/licensed 
hereunder be resold, leased, or otherwise transferred without said application software or the performance of services by 
the Dealer as aforesaid. "" "
825,3," Aims defended its pleading by arguing that it could be supported by a theory of a conspiracy between Prime and AIMS itself, 
where Prime actively coerced AIMS into unwilling compliance with its demands. This theory is inadequate because AIMS ' 
cooperation was unnecessary for the success of Prime's marketing arrangement. See Barnosky Oils Inc. v. Union Oil Co. of 
California, 665 F.2d 74, 77-79 (6th Cir. 1981) (no section 1 conspiracy where plaintiff did not show defendant needed plaintiff's 
acquiescence). "
828,4," The Section 2 offense of monopolization requires, if anything, an even greater showing of market power than does attempted 
monopolization. See generally United States v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 76 S. Ct. 994, 100 L. Ed. 1264 
(1956)."
828,5," According to AIMS, this is one of the submarket areas on which Prime has focused."
828,6," The market for add-on and upgrade equipment on its own cannot be considered a relevant market. See, e.g., Telex Corp. v. 
IBM Corp., 510 F.2d 894, (10th Cir.), cert. dismissed, 423 U.S. 802, 96 S. Ct. 8, 46 L. Ed. 2d 244 (1975) (compatible computer 
peripherals do not constitute a relevant market). "
829,7," Prime's market figures, however, are significant enough for AIMS ' rule of reason case under Section 1."
829,8, The dealer agreement provides that it shall be construed under the laws of Massachusetts. 
840,1," The term ""credit card"" is actually a misnomer. Not all so-called credit cards authorize the issuance of ""credit,"" i.e., an 
opportunity to pay off amounts owed over an extended period of time at some rate of interest. To the extent that any credit card 
does not require a cardholder to pay for a purchase at the point of sale, however, a ""free"" or ""convenience use"" period is 
endemic to all credit card systems."
840,2," A ""debit"" card typically accesses a cardholder's asset account at the card-issuing bank although a line of credit may be 
available as ""overdraft"" protection when the account balance reaches zero."
840,3," VISA is a member of VISA International, which administers the VISA system worldwide. Through VISA International, the VISA 
card is honored in 120 countries and has 100 million cardholders and 3 1/2 million merchants worldwide. Cards issued by 
members of VISA are accepted internationally, and cards issued by members of VISA International outside the U.S. are 
accepted by merchants in the U.S. With the consent of the parties, the issues and discovery in this case were limited to activities

841,5," Id. at p. 557. If a consumer became indebted to a distant merchant, the consumer would execute payment by purchasing a 
draft from his local bank made payable to the merchant as payee. The draft would instruct the merchant's bank to make payment 
to the merchant in the amount of the indebtedness. For this, the consumer paid a substantial fee. If the consumer maintained a 
payments balance with the bank, this sum would be debited from the account. If not, the consumer's would be obligated 
physically to transport to the merchant bank a mutually acceptable form of currency."
841,6," Id. at p. 560. The consumer would send the check to the distant merchant who presented it at his bank for collection. When the 
bank accepted the instrument for collection, it might credit the merchant's account immediately or await payment by the 
consumer's bank. The check itself was sent via a number of correspondent banks to the consumer's bank, where the 
consumer's account was debited that amount upon arrival of the check."
841,7," Id.at p. 572. A form of short-term, interest fee credit to customers whose patronage is highly valued. These customers tend to

society. The issuing organization (notably American Express and Diners Club) signs up merchants across the country of the type 
frequently patronized by travelers: hotels, resorts, restaurants, and a small number of prestigious retail outlets. Annual fees are 
normally much higher than those charged for the VISA or MasterCard and the system as a whole tends to cater to more 
""upscale"" clientele. "
843,9," In a few instances, NaBanco has also served as an agent of a VISA member on the card issuing side. As a result, NaBanco 
""receives"" IRF in the same sense that it sends it out; re, under the contract it negotiated with the VISA member. Exh. 515. Bull

major merchants for whom NaBanco is the processor are County Seat Stores, Eckerd Drugs, Waldenbooks, and Petrie Stores, 
and many major department stores, including Burdines' and Rich's. Bull TR. 1052-61 (9/13/82) Exh. 2199. "

879,2,"  It is the declared policy of the state that it is necessary to regulate and control the manufacture, sale, and distribution within 
the state of alcoholic beverages for the purpose of fostering and promoting temperance in their consumption and respect 
for and obedience to the law.  In order to eliminate the undue stimulation of sales of alcoholic beverages and the practice of 
manufacturers and wholesalers in granting discounts, rebates, allowances, free goods, and other inducements to selected 
licensees, which contribute to a disorderly distribution of alcoholic beverages, and which are detrimental to the proper "
880,," regulation of the liquor industry and contrary to the interests of temperance, it is hereby further declared as the policy of the 
state that the sale of alcoholic beverages should be subjected to certain restrictions, prohibitions and regulations. The 
necessity for the enactment of the provisions of this section is, therefore, declared as a matter of legislative determination. See also the preamble quoted in Part IV infra."
880,3," While such action by a state would now be immune from antitrust attack under Parker v. Brown, there is nothing to indicate that 
the Young's Market Court was peering that far into the future or thought that any such justification was required."
880,4," Both the Twenty-first Amendment and the Commerce Clause are parts of the same Constitution.  Like other provisions of the 
Constitution, each must be considered in the light of the other, and in the context of the issues and interests at stake in any

881,5," Three Justices believed that the decision, with the facts of which we need not here concern ourselves, was inconsistent with § 
2 of the Twenty-First Amendment.  Bacchus Imports, 52 U.S.L.W. at 4983 (Stevens, J., dissenting). "
882,6," When originally enacted, California's ""fair trade"" system was protected from Sherman Act preemption by the Miller-Tydings 
Resale Price Maintenance Act of 1937, 50 Stat. 693, which exempted from federal anti-trust laws state statutes sanctioning 
resale price maintenance.  The Miller-Tydings Act was repealed by the Consumer Goods Pricing Act of 1975.  See 89 Stat. 801 
(1975). "
883,7, The record contains no information as to what use has been made of this provision.
883,8," A partial answer might be that, except for action taken under the three day provision, no wholesaler, when he establishes his 
own prices, knows what the other wholesalers' prices will be, although he knows what their previous prices were."
883,9," The district court decision in Serlin rested both on the lack of any element of agreement and on Parker v. Brown.  Although this 
court affirmed ""essentially on the grounds stated in Judge Daly's well-reasoned opinion"" and noted that ""the Connecticut statutes 
do not authorize or compel private parties to enter contracts or combinations to fix prices in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act,"" 
our discussion focused on the availability of Parker v. Brown immunity. Morgan, 664 F.2d at 355, 356."
883,10, The Court summarized the evidence in a footnote:
883,8," .  For inter brand competition, in 1955, per case prices of the leading gins varied $2.71 per case or approximately 7 
percent.  In 1975, the difference per case between the highest and lowest leading gin was a single cent.  During that same 
period the case price of bourbons, excluding Ten High, narrowed from $13.47 (14%) variance to $.47 (1%). The leading 
scotch whiskeys went from $.50 per case variance equal to 9/10 percent to $.29 per case variance or 3/10 percent. "
884,," For intrabrand competition, with one exception, every wholesaler who sold one of the leading brands of gin, scotch whiskey 
or straight whiskey charged the same per case price as his competitors. Additionally, during the 15-month period prior to the hearing, there were only two instances where the price of one of the 
analyzed brands was reduced.  In November and December 1979, John Walker Red and Gordon's Gin were reduced in 
price; during those two months every wholesaler in Northern California who handled that brand made the exact same price 
reduction.  The following January, each increased his price to the same amount charged by their competitors.  Lewis-Westco, 186 Cal. Rptr. at 557 n.8. The only evidence approaching this in the present record is a portion of Battipaglia's affidavit in support of plaintiffs' motion for 
summary judgment which states that for five of the largest selling brands of wine, which were distributed by six or more 
wholesalers, there were several months in which there was wholesale price uniformity and other months in which there were 
price disparities, ranging in the case of one wine from 10% to 13%.  Peerless endeavors to explain the uniformity on the basis 
that each wholesaler pays the same price to the supplier, that most of the wholesalers are parties to the same collective 
bargaining agreement, and that the costs of goods, wages and fringe benefits amount to 95% of a wholesaler's total costs.  
Peerless argues further that there is vigorous inter-brand competition among wines. "

evidence of agreement on prices to the legislature."
887,12," These included a minimum mark-up of 11% on spirits and cordials, 20% on wine bottled outside Connecticut and beer, and 
36% on wine bottled within Connecticut.  Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 30-68, 30-68e, 30-68j (1975). "

893,1," When we use the terms ""Ohio I,"" ""Ohio II,"" and ""Ohio III"" in this opinion, we refer to entire lawsuits, not to the successive 
occasions a particular cause of action has been before this court."
893,2," Much of this discussion is derived from this court's opinion in Ohio-Sealy Mattress Manufacturing Co. v. Sealy, Inc., 585 F.2d 
821 (7th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 930, 59 L. Ed. 2d 486, 99 S. Ct. 1267, 201 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 256 (1979)."
893,3," The Sealy Court dealt with an aggregate of trade restraints, including horizontal market allocation as well as minimum retail 
price fixing.  In United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515, 92 S. Ct. 1126 (1972), the Supreme 
Court removed the ambiguity created by Sealy; the Topco Court held that horizontal territorial restraints even if unaccompanied 
by price fixing are considered per se illegal.  405 U.S. at 609 & n.9. "
920,1," Certification under Rule 23(b)(1) or (2), argued for briefly by the plaintiffs without case support, is clearly inappropriate. The 
discussion which follows should make clear that the risks contemplated by (b)(1) are not implicated by this case and that 
defendants have not acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class within the contemplation of (b)(2) (see 
in particular discussion of rule of reason inquiry, infra)."
920,2," The brewers' liability may also be established by proof that they were responsible for the illegal conduct of the distributors. See 
Mekani v. Miller Brewing Co., 93 F.R.D. 506, 509 n.3 (E.D.Mich. 1982). "
925,3," Plaintiffs rely centrally on a law review article which argues that exclusive territories should be per se illegal. The Sylvania 
Case: Antitrust Analysis of Non-Price Vertical Restrictions, 78 Col. L. Rev. 1 (1978). While the Sylvania Court did expressly 
leave open the possibility that some vertical restraints might justify application of the per se rule, Continental T.V. v. GTE 
Sylvania, Inc., supra, 433 U.S. at 58-59, no court since has treated vertical distribution restraints as per se illegal. "
926,," Plaintiffs also contend that because Anheuser-Busch has allocated itself an exclusive distribution territory and thereby 
maintained a ""dual capacity"", the conspiracy becomes horizontal and constitutes a per se illegal market allocation. According to 
defendants, no dual capacity case in the post-Sylvania period has applied per se analysis. The Ninth Circuit, in reviewing the 
only case on which plaintiffs rely, employed rule of reason analysis. Krehl v. Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream Co., 664 F.2d 1348 (9th 
Cir. 1982).  [*58] Furthermore, even if Anheuser-Busch's conduct were judged under per se standards, the conduct of the rest of 
the brewers would still require rule of reason analysis. "
927,4," There are some indications now that the Supreme Court may adopt rule of reason analysis for resale price maintenance cases 
in the future. See Jefferson Parrish Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 52 U.S.L.W. 
4385 (U.S. March 27, 1984). "
944,1," Mavis had originally brought suit in 1974 in DeKalb Circuit Court which had entered summary judgment for the city.  The Court 
of Appeals reversed the grant of summary judgment in a memorandum decision, Mavis v. City of Auburn (1980), No. 3-178 A 24. 
After a jury verdict for Mavis in Steuben Circuit Court in October 1981, the trial court granted the city's motion to correct errors 
and ordered a new trial.  In March 1983 Mavis received a second verdict which forms the basis for this appeal."

950,*," The HONORABLE STEPHEN N. LIMBAUGH, United States District Judge for the Eastern and Western Districts of Missouri, 
sitting by designation. "
951,1," Although Dr. Jenkins' December 1979 letter questioned Hayden's performance of only one cesarean section, she also had 
questioned his performance in another case. "
953,2," HN6[
] We recognize that some courts have held that antitrust plaintiffs may establish federal jurisdiction merely upon a 
showing that the defendants' general activities, taken as a whole, occur in or affect interstate commerce. See Western Waste 
Service Systems v. Universal Waste Control, 616 F.2d 1094, 1097 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 869, 66 L. Ed. 2d 88, 101 S. 
Ct. 205 (1980); Hahn v. Oregon Physicians Service, 689 F.2d 840, 844 (9th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 462 U.S. 1133, 103 S. Ct. 
3115, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1369 (1983); McElhinney v. Medical Protective Co., 549 F. Supp. 121, 127 (E.D. Ky. 1982). Nevertheless, we 
believe that the better rule is to require plaintiffs to show that the challenged conduct occurs in or affects interstate commerce. 
See McLain v. Real Estate Board, supra, 444 U.S. at 246 (defendants' activities infected by alleged price-fixing conspiracy must 
affect interstate commerce for federal jurisdiction to arise); Crane v. Intermountain Health Care, Inc., 637 F.2d 715, 723 (10th 
Cir. 1980). For an excellent discussion supporting this position, see P. Areeda, Antitrust Law para. 232.1 at 94-95 (Supp. 
1982). Although the defendant hospital's general activities may have occurred in interstate commerce, that is insufficient to establish 
federal jurisdiction. Instead, Hayden must show that the challenged conduct affects interstate commerce."
953,3," HN7[
] Under Arkansas law, the law governing this diversity claim, defendants are entitled to qualified immunity for 
statements made in the course of hospital peer review proceedings.  A member of a peer review committee is protected from 
monetary liability so long as he "
954,," acts without malice, has made a reasonable effort to obtain the facts of the matter as to which he acts, and acts in 
reasonable belief that the action taken by him is warranted by the facts known to him after such reasonable effort to obtain 
facts. Ark. Stat. Ann. § 71-5101 (1979)."
954,4," Hayden also contends that defendants made defamatory statements about him outside of the peer review proceedings.  He 
claimed that defendant Ross, a member of the Executive Committee, falsely told a Wyoming hospital recruiter that Hayden was 
not a good doctor. Hayden also alleged that an unidentified hospital administrator's statement that Hayden might soon lose his 
privileges was also defamatory. The district court concluded that neither statement was defamatory. It determined that because the Wyoming hospital 
administrator recalled only that Dr. Ross had made a negative comment about Hayden, Hayden had failed to prove the 
statement was defamatory. In concluding that the statement by the hospital administrator was not defamatory, the court found 
that the administrator had merely acknowledged Hayden's difficulties in response to a question from one of Hayden's patients, 
and had told the patient to discuss the matter with Hayden.  The record amply supports these district court findings also."
954,5," Hayden also contends that the district court erred in finding that defendants followed the Medical Center bylaws in the 
disciplinary proceedings against him.  Defendants' alleged failure to comply with the Medical Center bylaws states no 
independent cause of action, but is relevant only insofar as it bears on Hayden's due process claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 
his defamation and conspiracy claims under state law.  As we have noted, the district court properly dismissed the section 1983 
claim for lack of jurisdiction, and ample evidence supports its finding that defendants did not defame Hayden or unlawfully 
interfere with his practice.  Thus, we reject Hayden's contention that defendants failed to follow the Medical Center bylaws. "
962,1, Kalmanovitz is a citizen of California and the beneficial owner of twenty shares of common stock of Pabst. (D.I. 1 at 1.)
962,2," This Court in Kalmanovitz v. G. Heileman Brewing Co., Inc., 576 F. Supp. 922 (D.Del. 1983), dismissed Counts XI and XII of 
Kalmanovitz's original, twelve-count complaint in C.A. No. 82-797."
962,3," The Court has six prior published opinions concerning this litigation: Kalmanovitz v. G. Heileman Brewing Co., 576 F. Supp. 
922 (D.Del. 1983); United States v. G. Heileman Brewing Co., 563 F. Supp. 642 (D.Del. 1983); Pabst Brewing Co. v. 
Kalmanovitz, 551 F. Supp. 882 (D.Del. 1982); Jacobs v. G. Heileman Brewing Co., 551 F. Supp. 639 (D.Del. 1982); Pabst 
Brewing Co. v. Jacobs, 549 F. Supp. 1068 (D.Del.), aff'd, 707 F.2d 1392 & 1394 (3d Cir. 1982); Jacobs v. Pabst Brewing Co., 
549 F. Supp. 1050 (D.Del. 1982). "
963,4," The tender offer was to be made by JMSL Acquiring Corp. (""JMSL""), a Delaware corporation wholly owned by PST Acquiring 
Corp. (""PST""), another Delaware corporation which was to be owned 50% by the Jacobs Group and 50% by Kalmanovitz. (D.I. 
121, Ex. 1 at 3.) As part of the October 26 contract, Kalmanovitz would become a 50% shareholder in PST for $1,000."
963,5," At the time the parties entered into the October 26 contract, the price for shares of stock in Pabst trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange was approximately $20 per share. "
965,6," Because the Exchange Act does not expressly provide a private remedy for alleged violations of Section 14 or 13, any private 
right of action arising from violations of those sections must be implied. In Cort v. Ash, the Supreme Court set forth four factors 
relevant in determining whether a private remedy is implicit in a federal statute not explicitly providing one. HN6[
] Those four 
factors are (1) whether plaintiff is one of the class for whose special benefit the statute was enacted, (2) whether the legislature 
intended to create a private remedy, (3) whether a private right of action would be consistent with the underlying purposes of the 
legislative scheme, and (4) whether the cause of action is one traditionally relegated to state law.  Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. at 78. "
966,7," See also Pabst Brewing Company v. Kalmanovitz, 551 F. Supp. 882 (D.Del. 1982) where this Court found that the ""facts clearly 
indicate that Kalmanovitz and Jacobs . . . have personally invested substantial capital in order to capitalize the tender offer by 
the acquiring corporations. Thus, there is no question that Kalmanovitz and Jacobs are the dominating and motivating principals 
behind the JMSL tender offer."" 551 F. Supp. at 892-93."
966,8," Kalmanovitz argues that he has standing to bring an action for money damages for violations of Section 14(d). However, he 
fails to cite and the Court has not found any authority to support his claim. "
967,9," 549 F. Supp. 1050, 1054, n.3, 4. "
968,10," See Piper v. Chris-Craft Industries, Inc., 430 U.S. 1, 31-32, 51 L. Ed. 2d 124, 97 S. Ct. 926 (1977)."
968,11," See Transamerica Mortgage Advisors v. Lewis, 444 U.S. 11, 18-19, 62 L. Ed. 2d 146, 100 S. Ct. 242 (1979). "
970,12," The Court also noted that those who have a contractual right to purchase or sell securities have also been recognized as 
""purchasers"" or ""sellers"" of securities for purposes of Rule 10b-5, not because of judicial conclusion that they were similarly 
situated to ""purchasers"" or ""sellers"" but because the definitional provisions of the 1934 Act grant them such a status.  421 U.S. 
at 751. "
971,13," The defendants also argue that: (a) plaintiff has failed to make his allegations with the requisite specificity and; (b) plaintiff 
failed to plead reliance. (D.I. 166 at 25-28.) Because the Court found that Kalmanovitz lacks standing to sue as a ""purchaser or 
seller,"" the Court need not reach defendants' other arguments."
971,14," Although Italo Petroleum Corp. deals with a statute which was later amended to the current edition of Section 160, subsection 
(c) existed in the wording of the statute prior to the amendment. "
973,15," Because the Court finds that Kalmanovitz no longer has standing to pursue the claim that defendant Smith had breached his 
fiduciary duty to the Pabst shareholders, this Court need not reach defendants' other arguments that the derivative claims must 
be dismissed because: ""(a) of plaintiff's unexcused failure to make a demand on the Pabst Board of Directors and; (b) plaintiff 
could not adequately represent the interest of the other stockholders."" (D.I. 166 at 37-41.) "
974,16," In support of the allegations in Count VIII, Kalmanovitz in a conclusory manner and without reference to any specific part of 
the Complaint states: Plaintiff has pleaded conspiracy with great specificity. Plaintiff sets forth 81 paragraphs covering some 21 pages of specific 
facts before setting forth the conspiracy allegation. Plaintiff has set out the parties to the conspiracy, the period of the 
conspiracy, the object of the conspiracy and numerous certain actions of the conspirators taken to achieve that purpose.  
The allegations are precise enough to give rise to an inference of conspiracy and therefore defendants' motion to dismiss 
must fail. (D.I. 168 at 34.)"
974,17," For example, in D.I. 1, para. 104, plaintiffs allege that ""a recent proposed Consent Decree between Heileman and the 
Department of Justice will probably be rejected. . . ."" The Consent Decree was not rejected. In para. 109, plaintiffs allege ""there 
is no assurance that the Pabst or Olympia mergers will be consummated on any basis or upon the same terms as described in 
the HBC/Heileman Offer."" These mergers were consummated substantially in accordance with the terms of that offer with 
Heileman relinquishing all control over the operations of Pabst and Olympia. Again, in paras. 113-16, plaintiffs contend that 
various regional markets will be seriously altered by ""Heileman control of Pabst and Olympia"" and offer figures demonstrating 
how the ""combination"" of these three impacts on the markets to lessen competition. No such ""combination"" ever occurred. "
975,18," Plaintiffs' answering memorandum cites Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149, 102 S. Ct. 2540 
(1982), for the general proposition that ""competitors may be able to prove antitrust injury and thus have standing."" (D.I. 168 at 
36; emphasis added.) The parties do not disagree with this general proposition. However, in some circumstances, such as a "
976,," boycott directed against a competitor of one of the parties to a conspiracy, the competitor is injured by the violation and has 
standing. See, e.g., Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 79 S. Ct. 705, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741 (1959). Such is not 
the case here.  Neither this general proposition nor McCready suggests that Kalmanovitz has standing on the facts which he 
alleges. Indeed, McCready, which held that a customer had sustained antitrust injury, did not in any way alter, but rather 
reaffirmed, the requirement of Brunswick that plaintiffs have suffered antitrust injury in the particular case in order to have 
standing. See 457 U.S. at 482-84."
976,19," On November 21, 1983, the Court denied plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on their breach of contract claim because 
material facts were in dispute.  Kalmanovitz v. G. Heileman Brewing Co., Inc., 576 F. Supp. at 930-31. "
982,*," Honorable Edward D. Re, Chief Judge of the United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation."
982,1," We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 because the district court entered a final judgment certified pursuant to Rule 
54(b), F.R. Civ. P. That rule provides in relevant part: "
983,," (b) Judgment Upon Multiple Claims or Involving Multiple Parties.  When more than one claim for relief is presented in 
an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, or when multiple parties are involved, the 
court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an 
express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment."
983,2, For the purpose of this opinion we will refer to both appellees as Blue Shield. 
984,3," Other differences between participating and non-participating dentists include Blue Shield's refusal to grant non-participating 
dentists ""excepted"" dentist status, thereby requiring them to get pre-approval for new, expensive treatment, and its refusal to 
allow non-participating dentists to use the simpler claim forms used by participating dentists. "
986,4," Appellants appear to have abandoned the rule of reason in this appeal, contending instead that ""The Rule of Reason Does Not 
Apply Here,"" ""The District Court was wrong in applying the rule of reason at all,"" and ""use of the rule of reason was error as a 
matter of law."" Brief for appellants at 35, 40.  Notwithstanding this express disclaimer of application of the rule of reason, 
appellants made further reference to the rule in their brief, arguing that the district court's rule of reason analysis, even if 
appropriate, was incorrect.  Id. at 35-36, 40.  Appellants discussion was so cursory, however, that this court is led to believe that 
appellants are not pursuing the rule of reason on appeal. "
988,5," Appellants argue that the decisions in Glen Eden Hospital, Inc. v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Michigan, 740 F.2d 423 (6th Cir. 
1984), and Ratino v. Medical Service of the District of Columbia (Blue Shield), 718 F.2d 1260 (4th Cir. 1983), which applied the 
""walking conspiracy"" theory of Virginia Academy, militate in favor of finding provider control in the case at bar.  We find both 
cases distinguishable.  The Sixth Circuit in Glen Eden reversed the district court's conclusion that there was no provider control 
of Blue Cross.  In Glen Eden, however, appellant-hospital was allowed only severely limited discovery and its requests for 
information directly related to the theory that participating hospitals either controlled or greatly influenced the reimbursement 
policy of Blue Cross were denied.  For this reason, the Glen Eden court concluded that the grant of summary judgment was 
premature.  In the case before us, unlike Glen Eden, the parties have completed extensive discovery. In Ratino, the Fourth Circuit reversed a summary judgment in favor of Blue Shield.  There, the district court had concluded that 
the UCR plan fell within the McCarran-Ferguson Act's ""business of insurance"" exemption, see 15 U.S.C. §§ 1011-1015, thereby 
shielding the plan from antitrust scrutiny.  Holding the McCarran-Ferguson Act inapplicable, the Ratino court remanded the case 
for fact findings and a determination as to whether Blue Shield's challenged practices constitute a price-fixing conspiracy or an 
illegal boycott. "
989,6," Appellants argue that American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Inc. v. Hydrolevel Corp., 456 U.S. 556, 72 L. Ed. 2d 330, 102 
S. Ct. 1935 (1982), is controlling.  We disagree.  In Hydrolevel, the Supreme Court held that standard-setting organizations may 
be liable under the antitrust laws for the actions of their agents committed with apparent authority.  In that case, committee 
members had conspired to restrain trade unreasonably through a misinterpretation of the Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.  As 
we have concluded here, however, neither the policy nor review committees have engaged in conduct that runs afoul of the 
antitrust laws. Hence, there is no illegal conduct that may be imputed to Blue Shield. "
991,7," The district court commented: The Comanor affidavit refers to many factual assumptions for which plaintiffs have cited no support in the record: ""In the 
approximately 13 years that prepaid dental care and dental insurance have existed in Pennsylvania, it has become 
apparent that the commercial insurers are unwilling to supply programs which involve direct provider contact."" (No basis for 
these statements and conclusions is cited.) ""Moreover, while Blue Shield offers a dental indemnity program (Penndental V), 
this product appears to have been relatively unsuccessful in Market I."" (The plaintiffs have cited no evidence to permit the 
characterization of an objective on the part of Penndental V to compete in plaintiffs' Market I and a lack of success in that 
objective.) ""On this basis, there appear to be factors which limit in Market I the degree of substitutability in production 
between prepaid service benefit dental programs and dental insurance or indemnity programs."" (The language, ""on this 
basis, there appears to be factors . . ."" is an inadequate foundation for the conclusion which follows.) "". . .  Various large 
employers, as well as governmental bodies and unions themselves, desire only prepaid service benefit dental programs."" 
(No factual basis for this statement is cited.) ""For these groups, who are on the buying side of Market I, the degree of 
substitutability in use between prepaid service benefit dental programs and dental indemnity programs may be quite low."" 
(This statement on its face is surmise.) ""Fluctuations in price will not cause them to switch from a prepaid service benefit 
dental program to a dental indemnity program to the extent that they are committed, whether because of union pressures or 
some other reason, to provide fully prepaid dental care."" (There is no factual basis cited for this statement.  Further, it is a 
conditional statement and can not on its face support the conclusion that follows.) ""For other purchasers, however, the 
degree of substitutability in use between prepaid service benefit dental programs and dental indemnity programs may be 
relatively high."" (This statement on its face is surmise.) ""In conclusion, the cross-elasticities of supply and demand in 
Market I suggest that it can be viewed as a market with two distinct sub-markets."" (Considering the lack of a factual basis 
for the propositions leading to this conclusion and the tentative nature of this statement, the conclusion is not established 
for purposes of this motion.) In establishing the existence of two markets of purchasers of dental services in Pennsylvania, Dr. Comanor views the 
relevant issue as ""whether, in response to any possible price cuts by Blue Shield or Delta Dental, dentists will shift their 
output from the production of pre-paid dental care to individual dental care."" If so, Dr. Comanor says, these two markets "
992,," would effectively be one, but if not, there are really two separate and distinct markets.  Dr. Comanor then concludes that 
whether ""dentists will shift"" depends upon whether dentists are at full capacity.  If the dentist is not at full capacity, Dr. 
Comanor says, he is not likely to shift in response to price differences and there are therefore two markets.  Dr. Comanor 
states that, ""The fact that substantial excess capacity exists among Pennsylvania dentists suggest the finding of separate 
markets."" The plaintiffs have cited no facts supporting the proposition that substantial excess capacity exists among 
Pennsylvania dentists. Mem. op. at 28-30, reprinted in App. at 3399-401. "
996,*," Honorable Samuel P. King, Chief U.S. District Judge for the District of Hawaii, sitting by designation. "
997,1," Before 1977, the Kaiser appellees were organized in a slightly different manner.  The pharmacies located outside of the 
hospitals were not operated by the regional HP's but by regional Permanente Service Corporations.  These nonprofit 
corporations were formed because the Internal Revenue Service stated that the regional health plans would not be considered 
charitable organizations under the Internal Revenue Code if they ran the pharmacies. The Permanente Service Corporations, 
however, returned all receipts to the HP's less costs and a rate of return on capital.  The Service Corporations paid taxes on the 
amount allocated for rate of return on capital and then paid the amount remaining to the HP's. In 1977, the Internal Revenue Service declared that its denial of charitable status to health plans which operated pharmacies 
was erroneous.  The Service Corporations were then disbanded and control of their pharmacies transferred directly to the HP's. Because the Internal Revenue Service stated that the Service Corporations should have been treated as charities for purposes 
of the Internal Revenue Code and because the Service Corporations engaged only in activities that the HP's currently engage in, 
we believe the analysis under the Robinson-Patman Act for sales by the Service Corporations is the same as that for sales by 
the HP's.  Consequently, we will treat all sales at pharmacies located outside Kaiser hospitals as being sales made by the HP's 
even if some of those sales occurred before 1977 and were thus actually made by Service Corporations."
997,2," Actually, the summary judgment before us is the second one granted by the district court in this case.  We reversed the first 
one -- granted in 1978 -- on the ground that appellants should have received additional time for discovery before the motion for 
summary judgment was granted.  Portland Retail Druggists Ass'n v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, 662 F.2d 641 (9th Cir. 
1981). On remand, the district court permitted discovery for as long as appellants requested. "
998,3," As already indicated, appellants assert a Robinson-Patman Act claim against all appellees, including the regional Permanente 
Medical Groups.  The Medical Groups, however, do not sell drugs to members.  Rather, they prescribe drugs which members 
purchase at one of the pharmacies operated by either an HP or Kaiser Hospitals.  Because the Robinson-Patman Act HN2[
] 
governs only those who buy and sell at discriminatorily low prices, and not those who indirectly benefit from such purchases, see 
15 U.S.C. § 13 (a), appellants' claim against the Medical Groups must fail."
998,4," A small portion of the payment to the Medical Groups -- generally around five percent of the total payment -- does not depend 
solely upon the number of members in the Medical Group's region.  This portion is withheld by the HP and paid to the Medical 
Groups only if appellees meet their yearly financial goals.  This system of payment is designed to give the doctors in the Medical 
Groups an incentive to keep costs low, and it is required by regulations promulgated pursuant to the Health Maintenance 
Organizations Act.  42 C.F.R. § 110.104(b)(1)(v). "
999,5," At this point, we can treat the HP's and Kaiser Hospitals as one organization for analytical purposes because whatever is in the 
""own use"" of one part of a health maintenance organization would be in the ""own use"" of another.  After all, whether a member 
purchases his drugs from a pharmacy run by a regional HP or one run by Kaiser Hospitals doubtless depends on the fortuity of 
which location is more convenient for the member. Appellants argue, in effect, that we cannot consider the interest of Kaiser Hospitals in serving members because membership is 
a matter between the consumer and his regional HP and because the HP's and Kaiser Hospitals are distinct corporations.  
Appellant's Opening Brief at 12.  But appellants have misapprehended the legal relevance of corporate structure.  The cases 
they cite merely stand for the proposition that the presence of two or more corporations acting together is sufficient to satisfy the 
""combination, contract, or conspiracy"" requirement which triggers the substantive provisions of section 1 of the Sherman Act."
999,6," The language of the Nonprofit Institutions Act speaks only to purchases by institutions for their own use. It says nothing about 
sales by such institutions.  Abbott Labs, however, implicitly decided that whether an item purchased at a discriminatorily low "
1000,," price was purchased for the institution's own use depends on whether and how the item was resold.  See generally 3 E. Kinter & 
J. Bauer, Federal Antitrust Law § 25.9 (1983)."
1000,7," HMO's, such as the Kaiser-Permanente, can therefore engage in some sales that would not be allowed if we applied the ten 
categorical rules formulated in Abbott Labs to this case. For instance, in Abbott Labs, the Court held that fee-for-service hospitals cannot purchase drugs at discriminatorily low prices if 
those drugs are sold to refill a prescription, even if the original prescription was filled as part of an exempt sale.  425 U.S. at 15-
16. It appears that the Court declined to exempt prescription refills because the basic institutional function of a fee-for-service 
hospital is to provide temporary medical care for its patients. Refilling prescriptions goes beyond that basic institutional function 
because it extends the relationship between the fee-for-service hospital and the patient into the indefinite future.  Id. at 16 (A 
prescription is not for the hospital's ""'own use' forever just because it originated under hospital auspices.  We conclude that the 
statute's limitation has been exceeded when the connection with the hospital has become as attenuated as it is at the refill 
stage.""). As we explained in text, however, the relationship between an HMO and its members is ongoing, not temporary. The relationship 
thus does not attenuate simply because the member stepped out the door of an HMO hospital some time ago.  The HMO is 
consequently acting within its basic institutional function when it refills the prescription of a health plan member. "
1001,8," Appellees contend that they would cease sales to non-members if they were certain that doing so would not subject them to 
liability for violation of state licensing law, state tax law, or state rules of tort liability.  This record, however, is not nearly sufficient 
to demonstrate that the operation of these state laws immunizes appellees' conduct under the standard for antitrust immunity set 
forth in California Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum, 445 U.S. 97, 63 L. Ed. 2d 233, 100 S. Ct. 937 (1980). Nor 
have appellees made clear why closing the pharmacies to non-members would violate federal tax law, as they assert in their 
brief."
1001,9," To bolster their attempted monopolization claim, appellants filled their opening brief with references to an affidavit by Howard 
Steinbach.  The district court ruled, however, that the information in that affidavit was not admissible because the affidavit 
contained nothing but conclusory statements and hearsay.  We agree with the district court's ruling on this point and 
consequently do not consider the Steinbach affidavit. "
1002,10," Appellants also made an emergency motion to strike portions of appellees' Excerpt of Record.  We took this motion under 
submission with the rest of the case. The portion of the Excerpt of Record which appellants wish to strike served as an important basis for the district court's factual 
findings in this case. It was thus proper for appellees to include it in their Excerpt of Record.  Consequently, appellants' motion is 
denied. "
1012,1," A detailed discussion of the relevant history may be found in Litton Systems, Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 700 F.2d 785 (2d 
Cir.1983)."
1012,2," AT & T tariffs are imposed by AT & T itself on its customers. Tariffs must be filed with the FCC and can be disapproved by the 
FCC, but the filing of tariffs constitutes private action by AT & T, not governmental action. See Litton Systems, supra, 700 F.2d 
at 807. "
1020,3," The third issue on which the jury failed to reach unanimity was the question of whether AT & T's attempted monopolization was 
the proximate cause of plaintiffs' injury. "
1023,4," Utah Construction is the only other case cited by AT & T to support its argument that administrative determinations are 
inconsistent judgments."
1023,5," The FCC rulings, for example, were not the result of litigation between adversarial parties after full discovery. The purpose and 
methods of the proceedings are wholely dissimilar to those of the Litton litigation. "
1025,6," It is therefore clear that nothing in Judge Greene's opinion is inconsistent with Litton's findings that AT & T filed the PCA tariff in 
bad faith and that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine does not protect this conduct. "
1033,7," This distinction is apparently the distinction drawn elsewhere between equipment which is connected to the network and 
equipment which is substituted for part of the network. See Mebane Home Telephone Co., 53 F.C.C.2d 473, 477 (1975). "
1040,8," In Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2 (1984), the Supreme Court 
reaffirmed the general per se rule in tie-in cases, but found that it did not apply in the particular circumstances of that case, 
where the tying arrangements did not restrain trade on the merits by forcing purchases that would not otherwise be made. This 
case bears little resemblance to Jefferson Parish, and the per se rule should apply. "
1041,9," It is conceivable that none of the class members' equipment would need a PCA under the present FCC standards. However, as 
pointed out by AT & T at oral argument, it would be Glictronix's burden to establish this fact. It has made no effort to do so. In 
addition, AT & T has specifically alleged that certain of the class members' equipment, such as equipment which cannot prevent 
power surges, would be required to use a PCA under present FCC standards. "
1058,1," Both Jewelmont and Mervyn's also urge dismissal of the pendent state claims, since dismissal of the antitrust claim would 
leave this court without federal question jurisdiction. Because this court's jurisdiction obviously depends upon resolution of the 
antitrust standing issue, today's holding, that Haff lacks standing to sue under the antitrust laws, mandates dismissal of the entire 
complaint. The court does not thereby express any opinion as to the state causes of action. "
1059,2," There has been a tremendous amount of confusion among courts and commentators as to the difference, if any, between the 
terms ""antitrust standing"" and ""antitrust injury."" See, e.g., Ostrofe v. H.S. Crocker Co., Inc., (""Ostrofe I""), 670 F.2d 1378, 1386 & 
n.23 (9th Cir. 1982) (noting that the distinction between antitrust standing and antitrust injury is ""unclear""), vacated and 
remanded, 460 U.S. 1007, 103 S. Ct. 1244, 75 L. Ed. 2d 475 (1983) (remanding for reconsideration in light of Associated 
General), 740 F.2d 739 (9th Cir. 1984) (""Ostrofe II"") (on remand). Many courts, including the Ninth Circuit, have regarded the 
two as opposite sides of the same coin, and have merged standing analysis with antitrust injury analysis. See, e.g., Lupia v. 
Stella D'Oro Biscuit Co., Inc., 586 F.2d 1163, 1167-69 (7th Cir.), cert.  denied, 440 U.S. 982, 60 L. Ed. 2d 242, 99 S. Ct. 1791 
(1979); John Lenore & Co. v. Olympia Brewing Co., 550 F.2d 495, 499-500 (9th Cir. 1977); GAF Corp. v. Circle Floor Co., 463 
F.2d 752 (2d Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 413 U.S. 901, 37 L. Ed. 2d 1045, 93 S. Ct. 3058 (1973); but see Handler, Changing 
Trends in Antitrust Doctrines: An Unprecedented Supreme Court Term -- 1977, 77 Colum. L. Rev. 979, 996-97 (1977) (arguing 
that antitrust injury and antitrust standing are ""related, but, nonetheless, disparate doctrines""). The Supreme Court, in Associated 
General, has recently noted that ""the focus of the doctrine of 'antitrust standing ' is somewhat different from that of standing as a 
constitutional doctrine,"" since ""harm to the antitrust plaintiff is sufficient to satisfy the constitutional standing requirement of injury "
1060,," in fact, but the court must make a further determination whether the plaintiff is a proper party to bring a private antitrust action."" 
103 S. Ct. at 907 n.31. The indiscriminate merging of the two doctrines may sometimes generate analytical confusion; however, the distinction seldom, 
if ever, makes a practical difference. The primary difference between ""antitrust standing"" and ""antitrust injury"" is the point in the 
proceedings where the plaintiff's right to recover under the antitrust laws is challenged. To say that a plaintiff lacks ""standing"" is 
to say that there is no set of facts which could be adduced at trial to show the requisite competitive injury; this decision can be 
made on a motion to dismiss. To say that a plaintiff has not proved ""antitrust injury,"" on the other hand, is to say that plaintiff has 
not satisfied the burden of showing that he or she has been injured ""by reason of"" the antitrust laws. In most cases, this decision 
cannot be made until after trial. Hence one may have ""standing"" sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss, yet be unable to prove 
""antitrust injury"" at trial. This may be why the Supreme Court spoke of ""antitrust injury"" in Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, 
Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977), a case which went to trial, while it spoke of ""antitrust standing"" in 
Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 477, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149, 102 S. Ct. 2540 (1982), a case decided on the basis 
of a motion to dismiss. There is no indication in Associated General, that the Court regards the difference between the two 
concepts as having any practical significance, and therefore this court refers to ""antitrust standing"" in this case in its present 
posture. As discussed above, McCready and Associated General make it clear that antitrust injury must be looked at in order to 
evaluate antitrust standing. "
1061,3," Despite the clear disfavor shown by the Supreme Court for these formalistic tests and the adoption of a multifactor test, despite 
the application of such a test just eight days earlier in Chelson v. Oregonian Publishing Co., 715 F.2d 1368 (9th Cir. 1983) and 
despite its acceptance by the Circuit once again in Solinger v. A. & M. Records, Inc., 718 F.2d 298 (9th Cir. 1983), another panel 
of this Circuit proceeded to use the ""target area"" test saying that: If no clear answer emerges [from this analysis] we must determine standing by balancing competing policy interests, 
principally those of effective enforcement of the antitrust laws on the one hand and avoiding vexatious litigation and 
excessive liability on the other.  Parks v. Watson, 716 F.2d 646, 659 (9th Cir. 1983) citing Ostrofe I and Associated 
General. Now apparently in Ostrofe II some form of the Associated General analysis has been adopted. Ostrofe II placed particular 
emphasis on McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149, 102 S. Ct. 2540. Curiously, under the ""target area"" approach it is 
difficult to see how plaintiff McCready could have survived a standing challenge. She was not a direct target; the targets were 
the psychologists. Unless the ""target area"" was defined without perimeters, McCready would find herself out of court in ""target 
area"" jurisdictions. In any event, it makes no difference to the outcome of this case whether we employ the ""target area"" approach or the multifactor 
approach of Associated General, since even under the ""target area"" test it is clear that Haff, being a competitor of neither 
Jewelmont nor Mervyn's, is not within ""that area of the economy which is endangered by a breakdown of competitive conditions."" 
Conference of Studio Unions v. Loew's, Inc., 193 F.2d at 54-55. Moreover, though Haff has certainly been ""hit,"" there is no 
allegation that he has been ""aimed at."" See Karseal Corp. v. Richfield Oil Corp., 221 F.2d at 363-64. "
1062,4," The Court specifically refused to consider the propriety of any of the various tests employed by the lower courts to determine 
antitrust standing: ""We have no occasion here to evaluate the relative utility of any of these possibly conflicting approaches 
toward the problem of remote antitrust injury."" 457 U.S. at 476 n.12. As discussed infra, however, the Court in Associated 
General resolved the ""conflicting approaches"" of the circuits by adopting its own unitary, multifactor analysis. "
1063,5," The Ninth Circuit, in the recent case of Chelson v. Oregonian Publishing Co., 715 F.2d at 1371, suggested in dicta that whether 
an antitrust plaintiff's interests ""would be served or disserved by enhanced competition in the market"" is a factor to be examined 
in each case under the analysis set forth in Associated General. Chelson involved an antitrust action brought by certain news 
dealers who alleged that defendant newspaper publisher had violated the Sherman Act by selling newspapers to dealers on the 
condition that they refuse to deal with the publisher's competitor. Although the Ninth Circuit remanded for determination of further 
facts, and hence did not directly decide the issue, some of the court's language could be construed to mean that a private 
antitrust plaintiff who is neither a consumer nor a competitor in the relevant market would have standing under Associated 
General provided his or her interests ""would be served by enhanced competition in that market."" Id. This court does not attach much significance to this language. Many individuals benefit from increased competition in a given 
market, but this has never been enough to confer standing. Neither Associated General nor Chelson stands for a rule that any 
person, no matter how tangentially he or she might benefit from increased competition in a given market, has standing to 
complain of an antitrust violation. Rather, if any rule emerges from Associated General, it is that only consumers or competitors 
in a relevant market who are injured ""by reason of"" an antitrust violation have standing to sue under § 4. Actually this language appears to come from Associated General's analysis of the plaintiff union which, it noted, was neither a 
competitor nor a consumer. The Court noted in passing that it was not clear how the interest of the union would be served by 
increased competition. This made it all the more clear that the union's injury, if any, was not the result of any anti-competitive 
conduct contemplated by the antitrust laws, but rather was the result of its labor interest protected by the labor laws. "
1064,6," In discussing the factors to be examined in determining whether a given plaintiff has standing to sue under § 4, the Court in 
Associated General did not attempt to rank these factors in terms of their relative importance. However, this court is of the 
opinion that the directness of a plaintiff's injury is a far less salient variable than the relationship between the injury and the 
antitrust violation. Not only is this suggested by the manner in which these factors were discussed in Associated General, but it 
is also suggested by the Court's reasoning in Brunswick and McCready. "
1065,7," Like the Union's in Associated General, it is also unclear whether Haff's interests would be served or disserved by increased 
competition in either the seller's (Jewelmont) or the buyer's (Mervyn's) market. If, for example, Jewelmont were the sole seller of 
jewelry, it could presumably charge a higher price for its products reflecting its monopoly power.  Whether this would benefit 
Haff, as manufacturer's representative earning a 12% commission on all sales, would clearly depend upon the elasticity of 
demand for jewelry in the applicable price range. If a 10% price increase generated a decrease in jewelry sales of more than 
10%, Jewelmont's total revenues, and hence Haff's commissions, would decline. Conversely, if the same 10% price increase 
caused less than a 10% decline in volume, Haff's commissions would increase. A similar result would obtain were Mervyn's the 
sole buyer of jewelry, and it attempted to exercise its monopsony power to lower the market price of jewelry. Unlike the health 
plan subscriber in McCready, 457 U.S. at 484, Haff's alleged injury is not ""inextricably intertwined"" with the competitive restraint 
giving rise to the § 2(c) violation, since the extent to which Haff would benefit or suffer from increased competition is unclear."
1065,8," Section 2(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13(a) (1970), provides, in pertinent part: It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly, to 
discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any of the 
purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce . . . and where the effect of such discrimination may be 
substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent 
competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of 
either of them. . . . "
1072,1," While the third amended complaint charges the Castle defendants with monopoly, there is no evidence of such, and the 
plaintiffs do not argue that there is. The fourth amended complaint omits the monopoly charges against the Castle defendants. "
1073,2," This assumption is correct only if there is considerable judicial stretching of the words used in the statutes. HN3[
] So far as 
the Sherman Act is concerned, the words ""trade or commerce between the several States"" would seem to exclude land because 
land obviously cannot be a part of the trade or commerce between the ""several States."" HN4[
] The Hawaii statute forbids the 
monopolization of trade or commerce in any ""commodity."" In common parlance the word ""commodity"" is not used to describe 
real estate, and the dictionaries, both general and legal, defining ""commodity"" use the words ""personal"" and ""movable"" and do 
not use the term ""real estate."" In Moore v. Jas. H. Matthews & Co., 550 F.2d 1207 (9th Cir. 1977), the word ""commodity"" was 
held not to include land (cemetery lots). But HN5[
] the Hawaii Legislature defines the word ""commodity"" to include ""any other business."" Hawaii Rev.  Stat. § 480-1(1). Perhaps leasing land is a business, and while there was no dealing for the business of 
leasing land, perhaps the definition includes land with which the business dealt. HN6[

1074,3," But see footnote 10 in Griffith, where it is said that ""mere size is not outlawed by § 2."" 334 U.S. at 107, quoting United States v. 
United States Steel Corp, 251 U.S. 417, 451, 64 L. Ed. 343, 40 S. Ct. 293 (1920). "
1075,4, This clause differs from the clause in the Castle development contract.
1075,5," For the purposes of this theory, the plaintiffs ignore the fact that the Castle defendants' dealings with developers were very 
similar to those of the Bishop Estate. In another context, the plaintiffs argue that the similarity of the development contracts was 
evidence of parallel conduct. In Tax Zones 4-2 to 4-6, where both the Castle defendants and the Bishop Estate owned land in the years between 1946 and 
1977, the Castle defendants sold 5,376 leaseholds, and the Bishop Estate sold 3,069. Castle was one of the smaller large 
landowners, having 2.45% of the land on Oahu, while Castle & Cook, Inc. had 11.13% and the James Campbell Estate had 
13.20%."
1075,6," Consider a tract of land that has been leased for growing crops and either of necessity or by contract the lessee would have to 
cut brush, level the land, and perhaps dig ditches. Would the lease be invalid merely because, at the end of the lease, the lessor 
would get back land which had been improved? "
1079,7," United Mine Workers, 383 U.S. at 726 n. 16. "
1084,1," The record reveals that group dental health care plans originated in Indiana in the early 1970's.  These plans were, at the time 
of this lawsuit, included in collective bargaining agreements for the benefit of union-member employees.  Neither the ALJ nor the 
Commission found that the alleged cost-containment provisions included within these plans actually lowered the insurers' dental 
costs. "
1085,2," The lay personnel employed by the group dental health insurers to review a patient's claim form and dental x-rays are not 
licensed to practice dentistry within the State of Indiana, and thus have no formal dental or radiological training."
1085,3," The group dental health care insurers are commonly referred to as ""third parties"" or ""third party payers."" See Indiana 
Federation of Dentists, 101 F.T.C. at 57, 61."
1085,4," The Indiana state legislature created the Board of Dental Examiners to administer and enforce the ""laws pertaining to the 
practice of dentistry and of dental hygiene."" Ind. Code § 25-14-1-13(a) (1982).  In furtherance of this duty, the Board is required 
to ""adopt a code of professional conduct and . . . adopt rules and regulations establishing standards for the competent practice 
of dentistry or dental hygiene."" Id. In April 1982, some three and one-half years after the Commission filed its complaint in the 
instant case, the Board enacted new regulations governing the competent practice of dentistry within the State.  According to the 
Board, ""[a]ny person using dental diagnostic materials [including dental radiographs, see 828 Ind. Adm. Code 1-4-1(3)] for the 
purpose of recommending changes in the treatment plan upon which benefits are based is practicing dentistry and must be a 
dentist."" 828 Ind. Adm. Code 1-4-2 (1984).  Furthermore, the Board provides that ""Indiana dentists shall not knowingly submit 
dental diagnostic materials to any party involved in the Unauthorized Practice of Dentistry."" 828 Ind. Adm. Code 1-4-3.  The IFD 
contends that unlicensed lay personnel do, in fact, examine dental x-rays and recommend changes in dental treatment when 
they question a course of dental treatment.  Accordingly, the IFD claims that submission of a patient's dental x-rays to 
unlicensed lay personnel for diagnostic procedures is in violation of the Indiana state law as established in 828 Ind. Adm. Code 
1-4-3. "
1087,5," According to the ALJ's findings of fact, as adopted by the Commission, the IFD was organized as a labor union in an attempt to 
qualify for exemption from the Federal antitrust laws under the Clayton Act § 6, 15 U.S.C. § 17. "
1088,6," The record reveals that the IDA was named as a coconspirator in the Commission's complaint but not as a respondent because 
in November 1978, the Commission and the IDA entered into a consent decree that provides in pertinent part: ""It is further ordered, That respondents . . . shall cease and desist from engaging in any activity, course of conduct, practice, 
or policy that in whole or in part: A.  Requests, urges, recommends or suggests that dentists, or has the purpose or effect of requiring or organizing dentists 
to, (1) refuse to submit radiographs or such other pre-treatment and post-treatment reports, analyses and materials (except 
where post-treatment radiographs are not taken in the course of treatment and would expose the patient to unnecessary 
radiation) as third-party payers request for use in benefit determination or (2) refuse to deal in any particular way with any 
one or more third-party payers."" Indiana Dental Association, 93 F.T.C. 392, 398 (1979); 43 Fed. Reg. 53,768 (1978). Accord Texas Dental Association, 100 
F.T.C. 536, 540 (1982). "
1089,7," The ALJ made the following preliminary rulings: (1) The IFD's alleged anticompetitive activity had a ""substantial effect upon interstate commerce"" and thus the commission 
had jurisdiction over the complaint pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(1), Indiana Federation of Dentists, 101 F.T.C. at 77-78, 
153 (on appeal the Commission affirmed this decision, see 101 F.T.C. at 161-64); (2) The IFD was organized to ""carry on business in substantial part for the profit of its members"" and thus was a corporation 
for purposes of the Federal Trade Commission Act § 4, 15 U.S.C. § 44, subject to the Commission's jurisdiction, Id. at 75-
76, 153, 160; (3) The ""IFD is not and never has been a labor union within the meaning of section 6 and 20 of the Clayton Act,"" 15 U.S.C. 
§ 17, and thus did not satisfy the labor union exemption from the Federal antitrust laws, Id. at 76, 153, 160; and (4) The McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1012, 1013(b), which exempts the practice of insurance from Federal 
antitrust laws did not apply in the instant case because the IFD did not engage in the business of insurance and even 
though the illegality concerned the insurance industry, the McCarran-Ferguson exemption does not apply to boycotts, Id. The IFD does not appeal any of these decisions."
1089,8," According to the Supreme Court in National Soc. of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637, 
98 S. Ct. 1355 (1978), HN2[
] there are two categories of antitrust analysis: ""In the first category are agreements whose nature and necessary effect are so plainly anticompetitive that no elaborate 
study of the industry is needed to establish their illegality -- they are 'illegal per se.' In the second category are agreements 
whose competitive effect can only be evaluated by analyzing the facts peculiar to the business, the history of the restraint, 
and the reasons why it was imposed."""
1089,435," U.S. at 692. The per se analysis in Federal antitrust law applies to certain types of group boycotts. See, e.g., Klor's v. 
Broadway-Hale Stores, 359 U.S. 207, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741, 79 S. Ct. 705 (1959) (retailers combined with appliance manufacturers 
and distributors to boycott competing retailer); Fashion Originators' Guild v. F.T.C., 312 U.S. 457, 85 L. Ed. 949, 61 S. Ct. 703 
(1941) (organization of dress manufacturers and fabric designers boycotted retailers and manufacturers who dealt in copies of 
originals or refused to promise not to deal in such copies).  According to the settled law in this circuit, ""the HN3[
] common 
attribute of per se illegal group boycotts is 'a concerted attempt by a group of competitors at one level to protect itself from 
competition from non-group members who seek to compete at that level.'"" U.S. Trotting Ass'n v. Chicago Downs Ass'n, Inc., 665 
F.2d 781, 788 (7th Cir. 1981) (en banc) (quoting Smith v. Pro Football, Inc., 193 U.S. App. D.C. 19, 593 F.2d 1173, 1178 (D.C. 
Cir. 1978)). More recently, this court has stated that group boycotts are illegal per se only if they are used to enforce agreements 
that are themselves illegal per se. See Car Carriers, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 745 F.2d 1101, slip op. at 11 (7th Cir. 1984); Vogel 
v. American Society of Appraisers, 744 F.2d 598, slip op. at 3 (7th Cir. 1984).  We note, however, that the foundation for this 
statement initially appeared in Marrese v. Am. Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 706 F.2d 1488, 1493 (7th Cir. 1983), a case 
that was subsequently vacated by this court, and later appeared in Wilk v. American Medical Ass'n, 719 F.2d 207, 221 (7th Cir. 
1983), a case that relied solely upon the vacated Marrese opinion.HN4[
] "
1090,," Once per se illegality is established, there is a conclusive presumption that the conduct is unreasonable in violation of the 
Federal antitrust laws. Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society, 457 U.S. 332, 344, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48, 102 S. Ct. 2466 (1982);

United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545, 78 S. Ct. 514 (1958). If, however, the defendants' concerted conduct is ""not 
designed to drive out competitors, but to achieve some other goal,"" U.S. Trotting Ass'n v. Chicago Downs Ass'n Inc., 665 F.2d at 
788, the court must engage in a rule of reason analysis.  In this circuit ""[i]t is necessary under the rule of reason to show 
anticompetitive effects, or actual harm to competition, to establish an antitrust violation. . . ."" Bunker Ramo Corp. v. United 
Business Forms, Inc., 713 F.2d 1272, 1283 (7th Cir. 1983); Havoco of America, Ltd. v. Shell Oil Co., 626 F.2d 549, 556 (7th Cir. 
1980)."
1090,9," Pursuant to Ind. Code § 25-14-1-23, the practice of dentistry includes: ""Any person . . . who . . . offers to diagnose or professes to diagnose or treats or professes to treat any of the lesions or 
diseases of the human oral cavity, teeth, gums, maxillary or mandibular structures. . . ."""
1090,10," The record reveals that the State of Indiana was granted leave to intervene in this lawsuit in July 1979 by the United States 
District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.  The district court found that: ""The State of Indiana has and is, actively regulating both dentists and the practice of dentistry within the State. . . .  Under 
the mandate of Indiana law, Indiana dentists are prohibited from submitting their dental x-rays to third party insurers who 
employ 'dental consultants,' who are not licensed to practice dentistry, to read or diagnois [sic] the x-rays."" Indiana Federation of Dentists, 101 F.T.C. at 184. Thus, the district court ruled that ""[t]he order proposed by the Secretary of the 
F.T.C. would infringe on the State's right to regulate the practice of dentistry within the State as reserved to the State under its 
police powers by the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States."" Id. at 148, 184.  At the administrative hearing, 
the IFD argued that under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, the district court's ruling precluded any ruling by the ALJ on the 
issue of state action.  The ALJ rejected this argument, determining that the district court's findings of fact and conclusions of law 
on the merits of this case were not necessary for the judgment of leave to intervene, and thus the doctrine of collateral estoppel 
was inapplicable.  Id. at 143-52. "
1091,11, See supra note 8.
1091,12," The Commission ruled that its consideration of the IFD's state action defense was not barred by the doctrine of collateral 
estoppel.  According to the Commission, when the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana granted the 
State of Indiana leave to intervene in this lawsuit, the court's findings of fact and conclusions of law concerning the State of 
Indiana's regulation of the dental profession, ""were not essential to the judgment ordered"" and thus the doctrine of collateral 
estoppel did not apply. "

1095,14," According to the Supreme Court in F.T.C. v. Cement Institute, 333 U.S. 683, 691-92, 92 L. Ed. 1010, 68 S. Ct. 793 (1948), 
""soon after its creation the commission began to interpret the prohibitions of § 5 as including those restraints of trade which also 
were outlawed by the Sherman Act, and . . . this Court has consistently approved that interpretation of the Act."" See also 11 von 
Kalinowski, Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulation § 121.01 at 121-22 (1983). "
1096,15," In National Soc. of Professional Engineers v. United States, the Supreme Court reasoned that professional services, including 
the medical profession, ""by their nature . . . may differ significantly from other business services, and, accordingly, the nature of 
the competition in such services may vary.  Ethical norms may serve to regulate and promote this competition, and thus fall 
within the Rule of Reason."" 435 U.S. at 696. We note, however, that the Court has applied a per se analysis in cases involving 
the medical profession; refusing ""to tolerate manifestly anticompetitive conduct simply because the health care industry is 
involved."" Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 104 S. Ct. at 1565-66 n.42. In the instant case, the conduct of the IFD 
member dentists is not manifestly anticompetitive. Moreover, our rule of reason analysis stems from the fact that the conduct of 
the IFD member dentists is not designed to drive out competitors but to promote a legal, moral, and ethical policy of quality and 
proper dental care. See U.S. Trotting Ass'n v. Chicago Downs Ass'n, Inc., 665 F.2d at 787. "
1097,16," According to the Commission, ""[t]o assess the legality of the IFD restrictions under a rule of reason analysis, we must examine 
their nature, purpose and effect on competition, including an assessment of any possible procompetitive impact."" Indiana 
Federation of Dentists, 101 F.T.C. at 168-69. The Commission's statement is not a complete and accurate statement of the rule 
of reason analysis.  An examination of the effect on competition is not sufficient, there must be an actual showing that the 
alleged proscribed conduct has an anticompetitive effect in a relevant market. Phil Tolkan Datsun v. Greater Milwaukee, etc., 
672 F.2d at 1287; U.S. Trotting Ass'n v. Chicago Downs Ass'n, Inc., 665 F.2d at 790; Lektro-Vend Corp. v. Vendo Co., 660 F.2d 
at 268. "
1099,17," The ALJ found that: ""There is unchallenged testimony in this record to the effect that it is not economically feasible and in any event it would be 
a terrible waste of time to have insurers' professional dental consultants constantly travelling from office to office to talk to 
dentists (when available) and look at their x-rays."" Indiana Federation of Dentists, 101 F.T.C. at 84. "
1100,18," In light of this court's holding that under a rule of reason analysis the evidence presented at the administrative hearing failed to 
establish that the conduct of the IFD and its member dentists had an anticompetitive effect in a relevant market, we need not 
address the issue of state action. "
1106,1," Many airlines structure their services around major airports in network complexes termed hubs. The term derives from the fact 
that the routes of an airline maintaining a hub operation resemble the hub and spokes of a wheel, with the major airport, for 
example, DFW, as the hub and the routes to other cities radiating like spokes. "
1107,2," Section 4 provides in relevant part: The several district courts of the United States are invested with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of sections 1 to 7 
of this title; and it shall be the duty of the several United States attorneys, in their respective districts, under the direction of the 
Attorney General, to institute proceedings in equity to prevent and restrain such violations.  Such proceedings may be by way of 
petition setting forth the case and praying that such violation shall be enjoined or otherwise prohibited."

1108,8," Justice Holmes, a leading authority on the law of attempt, had more than one occasion to explain the principles of attempt.  In 
The Common Law (1881), he observed that ""eminent judges have been puzzled where to draw the line [between what 
constitutes attempt and what does not], or even to state the principle on which it should be drawn . . .  But the principle is . . . 
similar to that on which all other lines are drawn by the law.  Public policy, that is to say, legislative considerations, are at the "
1109,," bottom of the matter; the considerations in this case being the nearness of the danger, the greatness of the harm, and the 
degree of apprehension felt."" O. Holmes, Jr., The Common Law 68 (1881). In Commonwealth v. Peaslee, 177 Mass. 267, 59 N.E. 55 (1901), Justice Holmes, writing for the Massachusetts Supreme 
Judicial Court, held that ""if the preparation comes very near to the accomplishment of the act, the intent to complete it renders 
the crime so probable"" that the act will constitute an attempt.  177 Mass. at 272. ""Every question of proximity,"" Justice Holmes 
stated, ""must be determined by its own circumstances . . . analogy is too imperfect to give much help."" Commonwealth v. 
Kennedy, 170 Mass. 18, 48 N.E. 770, 771 (1897). "
1110,9," 15 U.S.C. § 1 HN8[
] provides, inter alia: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several State, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. . . . "
1111,10," In seven states, a solicitation could constitute an attempt: State v. Hayes, 78 Mo. 307 (1883); State v. Ames, 64 Me. 386 
(1875); Collins v. The State, 50 Tenn. 14 (1870); Mulligan v. The People, 5 Parker 105 (S. Ct.N.Y.1861); Griffin v. The State, 26 
Ga. 493 (1858); State v. Carpenter, 20 Vt. 9 (1847); State of Connecticut v. Avery, 7 Conn. 266 (1828). Other jurisdictions

67 Md. 524, 10 Atlantic 208 (1887), State v. Baller, 26 W.Va. 90 (1885), Stabler v. The Commonwealth, 95 Pa. 318 (1880), Cox

1111,12," See e.g., State v. Otto, 102 Idaho 250, 629 P.2d 646 (1981) (attempted murder); People v. LaFontaine, 79 Cal. App. 3d 176,

1112,13," Other cases also have concluded that a solicitation could be an attempt in certain circumstances.  See e.g., United States v. 
DeBolt, 253 F. 78, 82-83 (S.D.Ohio 1918) (""mere solicitation"" is sufficient for prosecution for attempt to make defective war 
material); cited with approval in United States v. Mandujano, 499 F.2d 370, 374 (5th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1114, 95

acts sufficient to constitute an attempt to commit a crime, if they are of such a character as to be well calculated and adapted to 
accomplish the crime intended."") (emphasis in original)."
1112,14," We reject appellees' argument that because the courts previously have not been faced with a factual situation similar to the 
case at bar, that the conduct cannot violate the antitrust laws.  By deliberately choosing not to delineate the myriad activities 
which would be forbidden by the Act, Congress left to the courts the task of determining whether given conduct constitutes an 
offense under the Sherman Act. See United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. at 474 n. 14, 98 S. Ct. at 2874 n. 14, 57 L. Ed. 2d at 
870 n. 14; Appalachian Coals, 288 U.S. at 360, 53 S. Ct. at 474, 77 L. Ed. at 829, Berkey Photo, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 603 
F.2d 263, 272 (2d Cir. 1979), 2 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law para. 1310 (1978)."
1112,15," We disagree with the appellees' contention that our application of § 2 would discourage discussion among potential partners in 
mergers and joint ventures.  Parties who wish to engage in substantial mergers or joint ventures, under the pre-screening 
procedures of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18a, must notify the Justice Department's Antitrust 
Division and the Federal Trade Commission before consummating the transaction.  The government may have no objection to 
the transaction, or it may sue to block the transaction pursuant to § 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 26. Chances that such a 
transaction would raise a dangerous probability of successful monopolization, are extremely remote. Transactions that are too small to be subject to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act will rarely pose a dangerous probability of successful 
monopolization. If there are such cases, however, and if in such cases the firm proposing the transaction acts with a specific 
intent to monopolize, then we see no reason why § 2 liability should not attach. "
1118,1," Plaintiffs assert in their complaint that their three firms represent the only black-owned architectural firms in Middle Tennessee.  
Together the three firms represent the membership composition of COMPACT. Complaint at para. 2(a)."
1118,2," HN1[
] Pursuant to 15 U.S.C.S. § 637(d), ""small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals"" are to be afforded ""the maximum practicable opportunity to participate in the performance of 
contracts let by any Federal agency."" 15 U.S.C.S. § 637(d) (Supp. 1982). "
1119,3," Prior to entry into this phase of the construction, architectural work on the airport facility was performed by way of a joint 
venture between Gresham and Smith and Reynolds, Smith and Hill, a Florida firm. MNAA, however, believed that the design 
phase for the terminal building would be conducted most efficiently if directed by a single architectural firm. Deposition of 
Thomas L. Mertins, at 27-28.  Accordingly, MNAA ended the joint venture upon entry into the design phase and awarded the 
prime contractor position to Gresham and Smith."
1119,4, The Court takes judicial notice of the census figures pursuant to Rule 201 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. 
1120,5," It is interesting to note that although the COMPACT agreement did not limit COMPACT's jurisdiction to only public contracts, 
the only two projects targeted at this point are the Nashville Airport Terminal and the Nashville Convention Center -- both public 
contracts."
1120,6," The Court finds the concepts of markets and submarkets, though traditionally applied in merger cases, are particularly 
appropriate to describe the business opportunities for architectural services in this case. The market as a whole is the market for 
architectural services offered to the entire community. The submarket identified by the Court today constitutes the statutorily 
mandated set aside share of public contracts reserved exclusively for minority business enterprises, plus any overlapping or 
additional share mandated by the affirmative action guidelines of a public agency which are not prescribed by statute."
1120,7," The Court finds that the actions taken by COMPACT and its members raise issues under both Sections 1 and 2 of the 
Sherman Act. However, for purposes of this decision, the Court bases its holding on Section 1 of the Sherman Act, granting the 
defendants' motion for summary judgment in light of the plaintiffs' per se unlawful allocation of markets and price fixing. The attempt to monopolize the market for MBE set aside shares on public contracts is implicated by today's decision, yet no firm 
resolution as to that possible Section 2 claim can be made without a full trial on the merits.  Swift v. United States, 196 U.S. 375, 
396, 25 S. Ct. 276, 49 L. Ed. 518 (1905) (requiring a showing of an attempt to monopolize and a dangerous probability of 
success); cf.  White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 264, 83 S. Ct. 696, 9 L. Ed. 2d 738 (1963) (whether a merger 
tends to ""substantially lessen competition"" normally requires a trial rather than the use of summary judgment). "
1123,8," Additionally, the bid specifications of Williams, Russell and Johnson, the firm chosen by Gresham and Smith, would have been 
subjected to more rigorous scrutiny had it been subject to competition from bids by each of the individual member firms of 
COMPACT. "
1124,9," As the Court observed above, MNAA seems to have been successful in providing minority business enterprises the maximum 
practicable opportunity to participate in the construction of the new airport facility. In most cases, MNAA was able to meet the 
targets specified in its affirmative action program. "
1125,10," Although Justice Stevens' opinion in National Society of Professional Engineers appears to rest heavily on the application of 
the rule of reason, this Court agrees with the reading given by a number of other federal courts that the per se rule actually was 
applied to condemn the Society's prohibition on competitive bidding. See Catalano, Inc. v. Target Sales, Inc., 446 U.S. 643, 647-
48, 100 S. Ct. 1925, 64 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1980); General Cinema Corp. v. Buena Vista Distribution Co., 532 F. Supp. 1244, 1256 
and n.7 (C.D. Cal.), aff'd 681 F.2d 594 (9th Cir. 1982)."
1125,11," What the members of COMPACT did not foresee was the Gresham and Smith would look outside the immediate area to 
procure a qualified minority architect to satisfy MNAA's affirmative action objectives. "
1129,*," This opinion has been circulated among all judges of this court in regular active service.  No judge favored a rehearing en banc

1138,5," The panel in Furman v. Cirrito explained that the three panels had tentatively reached conflicting results on the issue, and a 
request for en banc consideration of the other cases was denied. Slip op. 5639.  Although the members of the panel in Furman 
disagreed with the other decisions, they felt compelled in light of the denial of en banc consideration, to follow Sedima and 
Bankers Trust."
1138,6," The Eighth Circuit position has been clouded by Alexander Grant & Co. v. Tiffany Industries, 742 F.2d 408 (8th Cir. 1984), 
which rejects Sedima as inconsistent with Bennett v. Berg, but finds the racketeering injury requirement of Bankers Trust 
consistent with its own decision.  Alexander Grant & Co., slip op. at 6 n.7, 10-11.  It is not entirely clear to us how the Alexander 
Grant court distinguishes between the necessity of pleading a racketeering injury as here defined and the necessity of alleging 
the existence of an enterprise in order to make out a violation of section 1962(c).  Compare id. with supra at slip op. at 6. "
1140,7," The court in Sedima noted the dangers of deriving legislative intent from parades of horrors in opponents' speeches, slip op. at 
5549-50 n.22, but RICO's proponents also recognized the broad scope and the potential for unexpected applications."
1140,8," Some courts have justified their construction of section 1964(c)'s ""by reason of"" language with an analogy to Brunswick Corp. 
v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701, 97 S. Ct. 690 (1977), in which the Supreme Court held that an 
antitrust plaintiff must prove ""antitrust injury, which is to say injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that 
flows from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful."" The analogy has limited usefulness.  The central factor in Brunswick "
1141,," was that the plaintiffs claimed damages suffered by reason of increased competition.  The Supreme Court recognized that such 
an award would be ""inimical to the purposes"" of the antitrust laws, 429 U.S. at 488, and would ""divorce[] antitrust recovery from 
the purposes of the antitrust laws,"" id. at 487. By contrast, taking RICO's terms at face value might extend RICO beyond its 
expressly contemplated applications, but it in no way undermines RICO's purposes.  As the Supreme Court has said of RICO, 
""the aim is to divest the association of the fruits of its ill-gotten gains."" United States v. Turkette, supra, 452 U.S. at 585. 
Restrictive standing requirements analogous to those in antitrust laws would too often leave those gains in the hands of the 
RICO violators.  See Schacht, supra, 711 F.2d at 1357-58; Bennett v. Berg, supra, 685 F.2d at 1059; In re Catanella, supra, 583 
F. Supp. at 1433-34."
1141,9," This hypothetical is drawn from In re Catanella, supra, 583 F. Supp. at 1433-34."
1141,10, We suspect that competing extortionists would be unlikely to sue under RICO. 
1142,11," That portion of the Schacht opinion has been the subject of widely varying interpretations. See In re Catanella, supra, 583 F. 
Supp. at 1435 n.68, and cases cited therein."
1142,12," In Sedima the Second Circuit also held that before a civil RICO action may be brought, ""there must be a 'violation,' that is, 
criminal convictions on the underlying predicate offenses."" 741 F.2d at 503. That holding conflicts with our decision in Bunker 
Ramo Corp. v. United Business Forms, Inc., 713 F.2d 1272, 1286-87 (7th Cir. 1983). The issue is not presented in this appeal."
1142,13," In Schacht, supra, we concluded that while RICO's terms are very broad, the terms in dispute there were not ambiguous.  711 
F.2d at 1353-56. We discuss below the appropriate role for courts when dealing with deliberately broad, as opposed to 
ambiguous, statutory terms. "
1143,14," Moreover, the white-collar crime alleged in some RICO complaints against ""legitimate"" businesses is in some ways at least as 
disturbing as the bringing of RICO claims against ""legitimate and respected"" defendants.  For example, the facts alleged in 
Bennett v. Berg, supra, 685 F.2d at 1056-57, decided by the Eighth Circuit, illustrate concerted white-collar criminal conduct of a 
type at the core of Congress' concern in enacting RICO.  There the defendants included various businessmen, respected 
lawyers and accountants, and a well-known insurance company.  The defendants were alleged to have concocted an elaborate 
fraudulent scheme which had induced elderly people to invest most of their assets in a retirement village which the defendants, 
through fraudulent self-dealing and mismanagement, then took to the brink of bankruptcy, leaving the elderly people with neither 
their assets nor the ""life care"" they had bargained for.  As Judge Pratt said in Furman v. Cirrito, supra, Congress provided no exception for businessmen, for white collar workers, for bankers, or for stockbrokers.  If the conduct of such 
people can sometimes fairly be characterized as ""garden variety fraud,"" we can only conclude that by the RICO statute 
Congress has provided an additional means to weed that ""garden"" of its fraud.  It seems almost too obvious to require "
1144,," statement, but fraud is fraud, whether it is committed by a hit man for organized crime or by the president of a Wall Street 
brokerage firm. "
1144,741, F.2d at 529. 
1146,15," It should be noted that the plaintiff in Bankers Trust had already proven a substantial portion of its allegations in other court 
proceedings. "
1147,16," A number of courts dismayed by civil RICO have commented on the in terrorem settlement value that the threat of treble 
damages may add to spurious claims.  After all, the line between fraud and mistake or misunderstanding can be a very fine one.  
It is, therefore, important that, in the further development of civil RICO, criminal fraud be clearly distinguished from less 
egregious conduct.  On the other side of the scales, however, is another phenomenon with which lawyers and courts are also 
familiar.  The delays, expense and uncertainties of litigation often compel plaintiffs to settle completely valid claims for a mere 
fraction of their value.  By adding to the settlement value of such valid claims in certain cases clearly involving criminal conduct, 
RICO may arguably promote more complete satisfaction of plaintiffs' claims without facilitating indefensible windfalls.  And, in 
any event, the choice between simple compensatory damages and treble damages, with whatever effect such a choice might 
have on the caseload of the federal courts, is for Congress to make. "
1148,17," The Eighth Circuit appears to agree with the Fourth Circuit's conclusion that section 1962(c) requires an enterprise distinct 
from the person.  Bennett v. Berg, supra, 685 F.2d at 1061-62 (affirming dismissal of count naming identical defendant and 
enterprise, but permitting amendment on remand); Bennett v. Berg, supra, 710 F.2d at 1364 & n.4 (en banc); id, at 1365 
(McMillian, J., dissenting in part); Alexander Grant & Co. v. Tiffany Industries, supra, slip op. at 6 n.6 (Bennett v. Berg held count 
insufficient precisely because of possibility of identity of enterprise and person).  The Ninth Circuit also recently followed 
Computer Sciences on the point.  Rae v. Union Bank, 725 F.2d 478, 481 (9th Cir. 1984). "
1149,18," We agree with the statement in Hartley concerning a corporation's responsibility for the acts of its agents.  678 F.2d at 988 n. 
43. However, as we discuss below, those concerns are better addressed in terms of subsection (a) of section 1962.  The court in 
Hartley was apparently dealing only with subsection (c).  There are significant differences between the two subsections, and we 
must analyze closely the terms of these carefully drafted provisions."
1149,19," Section 1962(a) provides: HN15[
] It shall be unlawful for any person who has received any income derived, directly or indirectly, from a pattern of 
racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt in which such person has participated as a principal within the "
1150,," meaning of section 2, title 18, United States Code, to use or invest, directly or indirectly, any part of such income, or the 
proceeds of such income, in acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise which is 
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.  A purchase of securities on the open market 
for purposes of investment, and without the intention of controlling or participating in the control of the issuer, or of assisting 
another to do so, shall not be unlawful under this subsection if the securities of the issuer held by the purchaser, the 
members of his immediate family, and his or their accomplices in any collection of an unlawful debt after such purchase do 
not amount in the aggregate to one percent of the outstanding securities of any one class, and do not confer, either in law 
or in fact, the power to elect one or more directors of the issuer."
1150,20," Blakey argues that where the enterprise is an ""instrument,"" it should be civilly, but not criminally, liable to third parties under 
RICO. 58 NOTRE DAME LAW. at 323-25. We see no statutory grounds for such a distinction between civil and criminal liability. 
Cf.  Bernstein v. Idt Corp., 582 F. Supp. 1079, 1082-84 (D. Del. 1984)."
1150,21," Paragraph 19 of the complaint appears in part to track the language of section 1962(a), alleging that ANB violated section 
1962 by using in the operation of ANB's business income from a pattern of racketeering activity. In this court the plaintiffs have 
argued only section 1962(c).  Defendants suggested in their brief that plaintiffs had abandoned the section 1962(a) allegation, 
and plaintiffs have not responded to the suggestion.  Plaintiffs have therefore abandoned the point."
1150,22," As the Supreme Court said recently: HN17[
] A parent and its wholly owned subsidiary have a complete unity of interest.  Their objectives are common, not 
disparate; their general corporate actions are guided or determined not by two separate corporate consciousnesses, but 
one.  They are not unlike a multiple team of horses drawing a vehicle under the control of a single driver.  With or without a 
formal ""agreement,"" the subsidiary acts for the benefit of the parent, its sole shareholder.  "
1151,," Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 2742, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984). In Copperweld 
the court held that a parent corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary are incapable of conspiring with one another for purposes 
of section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1. That holding does not extend to RICO's provisions in 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) 
primarily because the Sherman Act is premised, as RICO is not, on the ""basic distinction between concerted and independent 
action."" Copperweld, 104 S. Ct. at 2740. The policy considerations discussed in Copperweld, 104 S. Ct. at 2740-44, therefore do 
not apply to RICO, which is targeted primarily at the profits from patterns of racketeering activity."
1151,23," The claim against Heller International is premised on the theory that Heller International acted through Grayheck, who is an 
officer and director of ANB, and perhaps through other unidentified persons.  Heller International is alleged to have thereby 
conducted or participated in the conduct of ANB's affairs through the alleged pattern of racketeering activity. The terms ""conduct"" 
and ""participate"" in section 1962(c) are quite broad, but it is not obvious to us that they extend to a parent corporation's 
involvement in racketeering activity solely through the actions of an agent of a subsidiary corporation.  However, since the 
defendants have not raised the point and the district court did not pass on it, we shall not consider it in this appeal as a possible 
basis for affirming a portion of the dismissal. "
1152,24," Some of the district court's language in Bache Halsey suggests that the probable cause standard might apply only in a final 
decision to grant relief after trial.  See 558 F. Supp. at 1045-47. However, the court relied on that standard to deny a party leave 
to amend its answer to include RICO counterclaims. "

1166,18," HN5[
] In passing upon constitutional standing issues, which the court recognizes are somewhat different from antitrust 
standing, the Supreme Court has also required a substantial causal nexus between injury and conduct. In Allen v. Wright, 468 
U.S. 737, 104 S. Ct. 3315, 82 L. Ed. 2d 556 (1984), it denied standing to parents of public school students who challenged the 
IRS's grant of tax exemptions to racially discriminatory schools, writing: The injury must be ""fairly"" traceable to the challenged action, and relief from the injury must be ""likely"" to follow from a 
favorable decision . . . Is the line of causation between illegal conduct and injury too attenuated? Is the prospect of 
obtaining relief from the injury as a result of a favorable ruling too speculative? "
1168,19," To the extent that this ex post facto affidavit contradicts or is inconsistent with the deposition, the court believes it should not 
be given sufficient weight to raise an issue, particularly in view of the other evidence. See Reisner v. General Motors Corp., 671

unless accompanied by ""concerted activity."" Hester, 659 F.2d at 436. However, in the present case, defendants have not 
""restricted access to advertising"" either individually or in concert; they have merely established rules for advertising content and 
have applied them in an even-handed, nondiscriminatory way. Without such ""restricted access to advertising"" in furtherance of 
some anticompetitive purpose, Hester does not save the plaintiff's claims from being dismissed for failure to state a claim upon 
which relief may be granted."

1193,8," The requirement of ""antitrust standing"" is different and more restrictive than standing as a constitutional doctrine. While almost 
any harm will satisfy the standing requirement in the constitutional context, much more is required to acquire standing to pursue 
a damage action under Section 4 of the Clayton Act."
1193,9," This frequently dispositive inquiry, see Associated General Contractors, 51 U.S.L.W. at 4144, has been referred to as the 
""target area"" test. It has also been described as requiring a plaintiff to show that he is ""within the area of the economy which is 
endangered by a breakdown of competitive conditions in a particular industry."" Id. at 4144, n.33, citing Pan-Islamic Trade Corp. 
v. Exxon Corp., 632 F.2d 539, 546-547 (5th Cir. 1980); Engine Specialties, Inc. v. Bombardier Ltd., 605 F.2d 1, 17-18 (1st Cir. 
1979); Calderone Enterprises Corp. v. United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc., 454 F.2d 1292-1295 (2d Cir. 1971). The Second 
Circuit has also stated that for a plaintiff to be within the target area, he must be: a person against whom the conspiracy was aimed, such as a competitor of the persons sued. Accordingly, we have drawn 
a line excluding those who have suffered economic damage by virtue of their relationship with ""targets"" . . . "
1194,," Calderone, 454 F.2d at 1294. Another Court of Appeals has asked whether the alleged injury is ""arguably within the zone of interests protected by the antitrust 
laws."" Malamud v. Sinclair Oil, 521 F.2d 1142, 1151-52 (6th Cir. 1975)."
1194,10," The Court also pointed out that any attempt to determine the amount of such speculative damages and apportion them among 
possible conflicting and duplicative claims would embroil the court in complex and potentially unmanageable proceedings. Such 
indirect causation and speculative harm has caused the dismissal of other actions under Section 4. See Eastern Auto 
Distributors v. Peugeot Motors of America, 573 F. Supp. 943 (E.D. Va. 1983) (dismissing a defendant supplier's counterclaim for 
lost sales based on the plaintiff distributor's alleged tying arrangement which forced its dealers to sell both Peugeot and Renault 
automobiles). "
1195,11," This Court recognizes that the standing requirements for injunctive relief under Section 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 26 
are broader than those of Section 4.  State of Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., 431 F.2d 1282, 1284-85 (9th Cir. 1970), aff'd, 405 U.S. 
251, 261, 31 L. Ed. 2d 184, 92 S. Ct. 885 (1972). Broader standing under Section 16 is justified because of the difference 
between the remedies available under each section. In contrast to Section 4, Section 16 does not involve punitive and potentially 
disastrous judgments for treble damages and attorney's fees; neither is there the threat of duplicative recoveries.  In re 
Multidistrict Vehicle Air Pollution, 481 F.2d 122, 130 (9th Cir.), cert.  denied, 414 U.S. 1045, 94 S. Ct. 551, 38 L. Ed. 2d 336 
(1973). Thus, the target area approach is irrelevant to the question of standing under Section 16.  Parks v. Watson, 716 F.2d 646, 662 
(9th Cir. 1983), citing City of Rohnert Park v. Harris, 601 F.2d 1040, 1044 (9th Cir. 1979), cert.  denied, 445 U.S. 961, 100 S. 
Ct. 1647, 64 L. Ed. 2d 236 (1980); In re Multidistrict Vehicle Air Pollution, 481 F.2d at 130-31. All that is required for standing 
under Section 16 is that the plaintiff show a threatened loss or injury cognizable in equity proximately resulting from the alleged 
antitrust violation. See Parks, 716 F.2d at 662. "
1203,1," In their complaint, filed February 17, 1983, plaintiffs also named the Interstate Commerce Commission (""ICC"") as a party-
defendant.  Plaintiffs requested -- as a predicate to certain further relief against the ICC -- that the Court compel the ICC to reach 
a decision on a related matter pending before the agency. In light of intervening developments and upon motion by the ICC, the "
1204,," Court on May 26, 1983 dismissed the action against the ICC as moot. See Order of May 26, 1983. The ICC is thus no longer a 
defendant in this suit."
1204,2," Plaintiffs' ""Statement of Genuine Issues"" purports to dispute a number of material facts asserted by defendant. Close 
comparison of plaintiffs' assertions discloses that while many of them challenge the implications or characterizations of 
defendant's statements, they do not effectively traverse them so as to put material facts into genuine dispute.  For example, 
plaintiffs state that they cannot ""accept[] as undisputed"" the statement by defendant that ""Atlas headquarters directs and 
coordinates [certain] agent activities."" PSGI para. 4, at 10-11. Plaintiffs, thus, object that Atlas does not ""direct"" the performance 
of origin or destination services, in any direct supervisory sense."" Id. (emphasis added). As suggested by the qualification at the 
end of the quotation, though, plaintiffs fail to dispute that Atlas does indeed have the authority to set the general terms according 
to which Atlas agents perform these functions for Atlas. And indeed, plaintiffs concede that ""Atlas does coordinate the movement 
of trucks, to a substantial degree."" Id. at 11.  Throughout this memorandum, in citing to corresponding portions of plaintiffs' and 
defendant's factual pleadings, the Court relies on the assertions therein to the extent that they reveal areas of agreement as 
described above, while disregarding any specific facts as to which the parties have succeeded in raising a genuine issue."
1204,3," The validity of the Atlas policy at issue in this case involves consideration of two separate statutory immunity provisions: 49 
U.S.C. §§ 11341-11342 (1982), and 49 U.S.C. § 10934(d) (1982). The first of these provisions, 49 U.S.C. §§ 11341-11342, has 
relevance to the van line practice, described infra at slip op. pages 5-9, of allowing some agents (referred to as ""carrier-agents"") 
to possess and exercise their own independent interstate ICC authority in addition to acting as agents for the van line. "
1205,," Coordination between a van line and its carrier-agents has, under 49 U.S.C. §§ 11341-11342, long been immune from the 
federal antitrust laws provided that the van line and its carrier-agents enter into a ""pooling agreement"" meeting ICC approval. 
See infra at slip op. at page 7. There is no dispute in this case as to the immunity provided by this provision. The second provision, 49 U.S.C. § 10934(d), was enacted in 1980 as part of Congress's deregulation of the household goods 
moving industry, see Pub.  L. 96-454, § 5(a)(1), 94 Stat. 2013 (1980), and it is this provision that addresses, inter alia, the 
membership on a van line's board of directors of the van line's own agents. Plaintiffs' do not dispute that, under the statute, the 
fact of such membership is immune from antitrust challenge. See Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant's Motion 
for Summary Judgment at 18. Yet the further scope of this immunity provision is disputed, and is discussed in detail infra at slip 
op. pages 19-23, 27. HN1[
] The provision reads, in its entirety: The antitrust laws, as defined in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12), do not apply to discussions or 
agreements between a motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the 
[Interstate Commerce] Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title and its agents (whether or not an agent 
is also a carrier) related solely to (1) rates for the transportation of household goods under the authority of the principal 
carrier, (2) accessorial, terminal, storage, or other charges for services incidental to the transportation of household goods 
transported under the authority of the principal carrier, (3) allowances relating to transportation of household goods under 
the authority of the principal carrier, and (4) ownership of a motor common carrier providing transportation of household 
goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title by an agent or 
membership on the board of directors of any such motor common carrier by an agent."
1205,49, U.S.C. § 10934(d) (1982). 
1206,4, See supra note 3.
1206,5," Agent operations for handling government or military traffic or exercising freight forwarding authority as referred to at PSGI 
para. 22 constitute separate categories of business carried out under separate ICC authorities. See Atlas Van Lines, Inc., et al. - 
Pooling Application, ICC Docket No. MC-F-15004 at 1-5 (July 15, 1983) (Defendant's Evidentiary and Other Materials 17). While 
such shipments may also be carried within a van line's infrastructure, operations under these ancillary authorities are not 
affected by the Atlas policy being challenged in this suit and thus are not at issue. "
1207,6," See infra note 22. The successive initiatives were: a) January 27, 1979. Atlas began to require that carrier-agents pay to Atlas one percent of their revenues from the use of their 
independent authorities, in compensation for the benefits they received from Atlas in aid of their independent operations. This 
requirement remained in effect until the last quarter of 1979. PSF paras. VI-A - VI-B; DRPF paras. VI-A - VI-B. b) January 27, 1979. Atlas announced a policy -- effective immediately -- prohibiting an agent from acquiring any new interstate 
authority or applying to add to his present interstate authority. Atlas states that despite its threats, it never enforced this policy, 
and publicly abandoned the policy by November, 1980. PSF paras. VI-A, VI-C - VI-D; DRPF paras. VI-A, VI-C - VI-D; DSF para. 
45; PSGI para. 45. c) November 1, 1980. Atlas approved a tentative plan to purchase the independent authorities of its carrier-agents. The plan was 
soon abandoned without implementation. PSF paras. VI-F - VI-G; DRPF paras. VI-F - VI-G. d) March 20, 1981. Atlas announced a plan that allowed agents freely to hold, increase, and use independent authority (without 
necessarily setting up a separate carrier company), but that banned any use of Atlas agents for origin and destination services in 
connection with shipments under such independent authority. The plan was implemented on May 1, 1981. After ICC objection 
that the plan required a new pooling agreement, the plan was abandoned on May 21, 1981. PSF paras. VI-H - VI-J; DRPF 
paras. VI-H - VI-J."
1207,7," Atlas's Agency Agreements state that they are terminable by either party upon thirty days notice ""without cause."" PSF para. V-
Q; DRPF V-Q; Plaintiffs' App. I. "
1208,8," Compare supra note 6, paragraph (d), where the ICC required a new pooling agreement."
1208,9," Plaintiffs sought to have this determination reviewed in the Court of Appeals for this Circuit, but the appeal was dismissed by 
agreement without the Court of Appeals having ever reached the merits. See Rothery Storage & Van Co. v. Interstate 
Commerce Commission, Agreement That Proceedings Be Dismissed (D.C. Cir. Nos. 83-1210, 83-1361) (filed February 6, 1984). "
1209,10, See supra note 2. 
1210,11," The relevant Senate Report language reads in full: There is also a provision in the act that immunizes carriers and their agents from the antitrust laws with respect to certain 
dealings between them. This section is needed in order to permit the continued relationships developed and approved over 
the years of certain van line companies. In some cases, van line companies are composed and owned by agents who 
themselves are carriers within limited geographical areas. In some cases, the agents, as carriers themselves, have 
independent authority to operate in areas in which the principal carrier also may operate.  Accordingly, in the absence of 
immunity, there could be some problems concerning immunity from the antitrust laws. The bill merely permits existing 
relationships to continue. . . . S. Rep. 497, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 8 (1979) (emphasis supplied). Analogous language in the House Report on this legislation reads: New section 10934 also contains a provision which immunizes from the antitrust laws certain discussions exercise [sic] 
agreements between carriers and their agents related to rates, charges, and allowances for transportation provided under 
the authority of the carriers. Further, such discussions and agreements related to the ownership of a carrier by an agent or 
membership on the carrier's board of directors by an agent are immune. The purpose of this provision is to allow the 
continuation of certain relationships between carriers and agents which have been established over the years. In some 
cases, the carriers are composed and owned by agents who themselves are carriers within limited geographical areas. In 
other cases, the agents, as carriers themselves, have independent authority to operate in areas in which the principal 
carrier operates. These relationships could be jeopardized in the absence of antitrust immunity. It is important to note that 
these exemptions are narrow ones. Specifically, the immunity provided by subsections (d) (1)-(3) applies only to 
discussions or agreements related to rates, charges, and allowances offered on traffic carried under the authority of the 
principal carrier. Similarly, subsection (d)(4) provides only a limited exemption. It does not exempt from the antitrust laws 
such things as anticompetitive mergers. H. Rep. 1372, 96th Congress, 1st Sess. at 10 (1979) (emphasis added). "
1212,12," The insistence on such a showing is further supported by principles recently set forth by the Supreme Court's decisions in 
Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 104 S. Ct. 1464, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1984), and Copperweld, supra. In 
Monsanto, the Court indicated that HN11[
] a finding of conspiracy could not be sustained on the basis of evidence merely 
""consistent"" with illegal coordination between a manufacturer and its independent distributors. Rather, a plaintiff must proffer 
specific evidence ""inconsistent"" with the defense of unilaterality. Monsanto, supra, at 1473. An analogous distinction provided 
the basis of the decision in Copperweld, where the Court rejected the proposition that a corporation can conspire with its 
separately incorporated but wholly owned subsidiary. Copperweld, supra, at 2742-45. The Court observed that ""Coordination 
within a firm is as likely to result from an effort to compete as from an effort to stifle competition,"" id. at 2741, or, in other words, 
that the challenged behavior was, by itself, just as ""consistent"" with the ""effort to compete,"" legitimately, as it was with the ""effort 
to stifle competition."" The Court thus seems to suggest that in such circumstances, the antitrust laws can only be triggered by 
proffering evidence of behavior ""inconsistent"" with otherwise legitimate purposes. In the instant case, thus, HN12[
] the mere showing of a ""personal benefit"" traceable to an agent on the Atlas board of 
directors should not suffice to trigger the ""independent stake"" exception -- assuming one exists -- unless plaintiffs also proffer 
evidence showing that the personal benefit in question was inconsistent with or divergent from Atlas's own competitive interests. 
There is a longstanding presumption that the members of a corporation's board of directors are incapable of conspiring with 
themselves under the Sherman Act in that there is no other way that a corporation can advance its competitive interests, see 
Nelson Radio, supra, and, thus, the Court is reluctant to find that the plaintiffs have demonstrated the existence of ""the plurality 
of actors imperative for a § 1 conspiracy,"" Copperweld, supra, at 2741, without a proffer of evidence suggesting that the personal 
benefits derived from the board's actions were inconsistent with or divergent from the interests of Atlas itself. "
1213,13," In Spray-Rite, supra, the Supreme Court confirmed the vitality of United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300, 63 L. Ed. 992, 
39 S. Ct. 465 (1919). As the Court explained: Under Colgate, HN14[
] the manufacturer can announce its resale prices in advance and refuse to deal with those who 
fail to comply. And a distributor is free to acquiesce in the manufacturer's demand in order to avoid termination. Spray-Rite, supra, at 1469. The Colgate/Spray-Rite doctrine applies to non-price terms of dealing -- such as those in this case -- 
as well."
1213,14," Plaintiffs theorize that the new policy tended to cause either of two outcomes: 1) agents abandoned or failed to seek 
independent authority under which they might have charged lower prices for moving services comparable to those that they 
were providing as Atlas agents, or 2) agents transferred their independent authority to separate corporations, and the additional 
cost of doing so dampened their ability to charge lower rates on the independent shipments."
1213,15," As noted, it is typical in the moving industry for the agents of a van line to enter into exclusive dealing agreements with the van 
line; i.e., they agree not to provide van line services to any company that is not also an agent of the van line that they serve. 
Plaintiffs argue that this practice should in this case be treated as an antitrust violation because it is an integral part of Atlas's 
alleged boycott and price maintenance schemes. Though exclusive dealing arrangements are traditionally treated under the 
Rule of Reason, plaintiffs contend that here they should be treated as part of Atlas's other per se violations. "
1214,16," Cf.  North American Van Lines, Inc. v. I.C.C., 666 F.2d 1087, 1094-96 (7th Cir. 1981) (van line challenge against ICC 
regulations implemented after deregulation) (""There was no evidence before us regarding the customary arrangements . . . 
between national carriers and their agents.""); Clemmer v. North American Van Lines, Inc., 1969 Trade Cases para. 72,936, at 
87609 (E.D. Pa. 1969) (van line's allocation of exclusive territories between agents deemed not in violation of the antitrust laws) 
(policy in question did not affect carrier-agents' independent shipments). "
1215,17," The Senate Report discussion of this matter reads in full: During the course of its deliberations, the Committee considered a proposal to include within the immunity section language 
that would grant immunity to agreements concerning exclusive agency representation, or the fiduciary duty of loyalty of an 
agent not to compete with the principal concerning the subject matter of the agency. The Committee determined that this 
type of relationship is not a violation of the antitrust laws and is standard agency law as expressed in section 393 of the 
Restatement of the Law of Agencies section. The Committee felt that inclusion of such language could imply that such 
relationships are a violation of the antitrust laws in the absence of immunity. Thus, the Committee determined not to include 
such language in the bill. S. Rep. 497, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 8 (1979). Neither party makes any issue of the portion of this passage explaining that ""the 
Committee determined not to include"" language in the bill that might have immunized exclusive agency or fiduciary duty 
agreements directly. Thus, it is not necessary to resolve any questions that might arise from the fact that such language was 
consciously excluded. However, the Court is inclined to agree with the observation of the Senate Committee that ""this type of 
relationship is not a violation of the antitrust laws,"" id. Cf.  Delta Data Systems Corp. v. Webster, 744 F.2d 197, slip op. at 8-9 
(D.C.Cir. Sept. 21, 1984) (valid to consider GAO report as persuasive even if not binding)."
1215,18," The House Report on the legislation states, under the heading ""Section 2. Declaration of Policy,"" that: Section 2 sets forth congressional policy with respect to the household goods moving industry. The emphasis in the policy 
statement is threefold -- the reduction of unnecessary regulation, the strengthening of consumer remedies and protections, 
and the establishment of maximum carrier flexibility in pricing their services and meeting the needs of their shippers. H. Rep. 1372, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 5 (1979) (emphasis added). See also S. Rep. 497, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 8 (1979) (""The bill 
merely permits existing [carrier-agent] relationships to continue."" (emphasis added)). "
1216,19," It is worth noting, in this regard, that one other major van line has determined to accept the costs of permitting its carrier-
agents to shift their established names to such newly created separate entities. See DSF para. 79. Counsel for the defendant 
may themselves yet decide, out of an abundance of caution and in anticipation of a possible appeal, to recommend to Atlas the 
adoption of this more conservative approach. "
1217,20," Plaintiffs themselves report that ""Allied Van Lines, the largest van line, allows no firm affiliated with it to have or to use 
authority to conduct interstate operations competitive with its own. This arrangement was approved and immunized from the 
antitrust laws by the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1946, following an antitrust action suit brought by the Justice 
Department. Evanston Fireproof Warehouse, et al., - Control - Allied Van Lines, 46 M.C.C. 557 (1946)."" PSF para. III-I."
1217,21," The court does not itself face the question, nor intimate any ruling, on whether indeed it would be valid under the antitrust laws 
for a van line to take the more extreme step of banning its agents even from having separate affiliates exercise independent 
carrier authority. Suffice it to note that plaintiffs, having conceded that a van line is entitled to take such extreme action, see 
Transcript of Hearing, August 6, 1984, at 19-23, are in no position to argue that Atlas's less extreme action is unreasonable. 
Given that Atlas bars only the exercise of independent authority by the agency companies themselves, the policy goes no farther 
than is necessary to enforce traditional agency standards upon the agent companies alone. The discussion above demonstrates 
the reasonableness of a policy that is limited in this fashion."
1217,22," To the extent that plaintiffs' claims also challenge Atlas's earlier, aborted efforts to cope with the advent of deregulation, see 
supra note 6, the Court similarly finds that no violation of the rule of reason can be demonstrated. Even apart from whether the 
""conspiracy"" requirement can be met as to these earlier Atlas actions, the Court finds that their short duration, the prerogative of 
Atlas to impose traditional agency standards upon its agents, and the procompetitive aim of the actions establish that they 
cannot be deemed ""unreasonable"" under the Sherman Act. "
1234,1," At oral argument the plaintiffs' counsel informed this court that Dr. Marrese ""is no longer practicing in Evansville,"" but counsel 
failed to provide this court with any information concerning Dr. Marrese's status at Deaconess Hospital, much less his underlying 
reason for no longer practicing in Evansville, Indiana.  It is clear from the plaintiffs' first amended complaint that Dr. Marrese's 
clinical privileges at Deaconess had not been revoked prior to the filing of this lawsuit in July 1982."
1234,2," According to the plaintiffs' first amended complaint, the ""back"" procedures audited by the SAHC included, inter alia, fifty lumbar 
laminectomies and forty spinal fusions performed by orthopedic surgeons on the staff at Deaconess Hospital."
1234,3," The Indiana legislature defines good faith as ""an act taken without malice after a reasonable effort to obtain the facts of the 
matter and in the reasonable belief that the action taken is warranted by the facts known."" Ind. Code § 34-4-12.6-1(f) (1982). "
1235,4," Effective April 1983, the Indiana legislature amended Ind. Code § 16-10-1-6.5 to provide in pertinent part: ""The governing board and its employees, agents, consultants, and attorneys have absolute immunity from civil liability for 
communications, discussions, actions taken, and reports made concerning disciplinary action or investigation taken or 
contemplated, if such reports or actions are made in good faith and without malice."" Ind. Code Ann. § 16-10-1-6.5(b) (Burns Supp. 1983)."
1235,5," According to the Fair Hearing Plan at Deaconess, a practitioner is entitled to an evidentiary hearing for the following 
recommendations or actions: ""(a) Denial of initial staff appointment (b) Denial of reappointment (c) Suspension of staff membership (d) Revocation of staff membership (e) Denial of requested advancement in staff category (f) A change in staff category not acceptable to the practitioner (g) Limitation of the right to admit patients (h) Denial of requested department/service/section affiliation (i) Denial of requested clinical privileges (j) Reduction of clinical privileges (k) Suspension of clinical privileges (l) Revocation of clinical privileges (m) Terms of probation (n) Individual requirement of consultation"
1235,6," The five hearing committee members are appointed by the president of the medical staff when the hearing is occasioned by an 
adverse recommendation of the Medical Staff Executive Council.  On the other hand, when the hearing is occasioned by an 
adverse recommendation of the governing hospital board, the board president appoints the five members of the hearing 
committee. "
1236,7," We express no view concerning the defendants' ""good faith"" and/or ""bad faith"" in the present case, as that issue is not 
presently before the court."
1236,8," The record reveals that the plaintiffs filed their initial complaint in this action on July 12, 1982.  Some two weeks later, on July 
27, 1982, the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint."
1236,9," The plaintiffs' first amended complaint also included a pendent state claim, alleging that the defendants' actions constituted a 
tortious interference with business relations. "
1237,10," The record before this court reveals that the plaintiffs' allegation of out-of-state purchases, revenues, and fees in excess of 
$500,000 refers to an annual sum."
1237,11," The court ruled that the plaintiffs' claim of an anticompetitive, unfair, and unconstitutional Fair Hearing Plan at Deaconess 
Hospital failed to allege sufficient ""state action"" to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The court further ruled that because the 
federal claims were dismissed, it no longer retained jurisdiction over the pendent state law claim.  The plaintiffs do not appeal 
these decisions."
1237,12," The district court denied the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a second amended complaint and thus that complaint was never 
made a part of the district court record.  It is clear, however, that the judge received and reviewed a copy of the second "
1238,," amended complaint as did the defendants who filed a memorandum in opposition to the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file an 
amended complaint.  On appeal, the plaintiffs have presented this court with a copy of the second amended complaint which 
alleges, in addition to the allegations of the first amended complaint, that: ""Approximately 300 patients per year travel from Western Kentucky and Southern Illinois into the State of Indiana for 
treatment by DR. MARRESE.  Each patient is seen by DR. MARRESE on six separate occasions for a total of 
approximately 1,800 visits per year by out-of-state patients into the State of Indiana from DR. MARRESE.  These patients 
are billed approximately $1,000,000.00 per year by DR. MARRESE and approximately $10,000,000.00 by the HOSPITAL. . 
. .  The vast majority of these patients are treated by DR. MARRESE at least once at the HOSPITAL and a large 
percentage of these cases involve complex spinal surgery.  If DR. MARRESE's privileges at the HOSPITAL are terminated, 
these patients will not cross state lines into the State of Indiana for their medical treatment for they come to DR. MARRESE 
because of his superior expertise in spinal diagnosis and treatment."" The second amended complaint also alleges that Dr. Marrese had contracted to purchase a $500,000 computerized tomography 
body scanner from a New Jersey firm.  Specifically, Dr. Marrese alleges that he had made a down payment on the machine, had 
arranged financing with a Missouri firm, and had entered into an agreement with an out-of-state physician, a ""national expert in 
the field of computerized tomography scanning,"" to read and interpret the specialized x-rays.  Dr. Marrese claims that as a result 
of the defendants' alleged illegal conduct, he was forced to cancel the agreement to purchase the scanner, the financing 
arrangement with the x-ray reading agreement with the out-of-state physician."
1238,13," The record reveals that at the pleading stage of this proceeding the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' 
complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  For purposes of the 
Sherman Act claims, the district court treated the defendants' motion as a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction 
under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), and dismissed the claims.  According to the Supreme Court in Hospital Building Co., the 
jurisdictional requirement of interstate commerce may be analyzed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6), ""the critical inquiry 
is into the adequacy of the nexus between [defendants'] conduct and interstate commerce that is alleged in the complaint."" 425 
U.S. at 742 n.1."
1238,14," Due to the fact that the plaintiffs' second amended complaint was never made a part of the district record, this court limits its 
review to the plaintiffs' first amended complaint. "
1241,15," We note that courts have also dismissed doctors' claims under the Sherman Act, for the denial or revocation of hospital staff 
privileges, due to the plaintiff doctors' failure to allege a sufficient interstate commerce nexus.  See Hayden v. Bracy, 744 F.2d 
1338, slip op. at 8-9 (8th Cir. 1984); Furlong v. Long Island College Hosp., 710 F.2d 922, 927-28 (2d Cir. 1983); Capili v. Shott, 
620 F.2d 438, 439 (4th Cir. 1980) (per curiam); Wolf v. Jane Phillips Episcopal-Memorial Med. Ctr., 513 F.2d 684, 687-88 (10th 
Cir. 1975); Moles v. Morton F. Plant Hospital, Inc., 1980-1 Trade Cases 77,186, 77,189-90 (M.D. Fla. 1978), aff'd without 
opinion, 617 F.2d 293 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 919, 66 L. Ed. 2d 147, 101 S. Ct. 317 (1980)."
1241,16," In Western Waste Service v. Universal Waste Control, 616 F.2d 1094 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 869, 66 L. Ed. 2d 88, 
101 S. Ct. 205 (1980), the Ninth Circuit interpreted McLain to mean ""that it was not necessary for the alleged antitrust violations 
complained of to have affected interstate commerce as long as defendants' business activities, independent of the violations, 
affected interstate commerce."" 616 F.2d at 1097 (emphasis added).  In Crane v. Intermountain Health Care, 637 F.2d at 724, the 
Tenth Circuit stated that ""we do not believe McLain signals a shift in analytical focus away from the challenged activity and 
towards the defendant's general or overall business.  The analytical focus continues to be on the nexus, assessed in practical 
terms, between interstate commerce and the challenged activity."" In the instant case, we need not reach the issue of whether 
the plaintiffs could rely upon the interstate business activities of defendant, Deaconess Hospital, to satisfy the jurisdictional 
requirement of interstate commerce under the Sherman Act. See Bunker Ramo Corp. v. United Business Forms, Inc., 713 F.2d 
at 1282 (this court does not find it necessary to choose between the various interpretations of McLain).  Based upon the 
plaintiffs' allegations that Dr. Marrese treats out-of-state patients and has interstate purchases, revenues, and fees in excess of 
$500,000 annually, it may well be that the plaintiffs can demonstrate a substantial and adverse impact upon interstate 
commerce. Accord Cardio-Medical Associates, 721 F.2d at 76. "
1243,17," On August 10, 1984, the parties were ordered to furnish the court with supplemental briefs, analyzing the applicability of the 
""state action"" doctrine in the present case.  The plaintiffs and defendants each submitted a supplemental and a reply brief on this 
issue. "
1244,18," HN21[
] To satisfy the ""clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy"" element of the state action doctrine, the 
state legislature must authorize the challenged activity and the legislature must intend to displace the Federal antitrust laws. See 
P. Areeda, Antitrust Law para. 212.3 at 53 (Supp. 1982).  See also Community Communications Co. v. Boulder, 455 U.S. at 
51-52; Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. at 415 (opinion of Brennan, J.).  HN22[
] The state legislature's 
intent to displace the federal antitrust laws exists if the challenged restraint is a necessary consequence of engaging in the 
authorized activity.  P. Areeda, Antitrust Law, supra, at 54.  See also HyBud Equip. Corp. v. City of Akron, 742 F.2d 949, slip 
op. at 19 (6th Cir. 1984)."
1244,19," See, e.g., S. Sachs, Antitrust, The States, and The Professions, 52 Antitrust L.J. 189, 191-92 (1983) (professional areas 
create a potential tension between Federal antitrust laws and states' legitimate interest in regulation); D. Smith, Antitrust 
Immunity for State Action: A Functional Approach, 31 Baylor L. R. 263, 289-92 (1979) (state action doctrine is an 
accommodation of potentially competing sovereigns). "
1245,20," In the instant case, our state action analysis is, by necessity, limited to a review of the Indiana statutory scheme regulating the 
medical peer review process. We note, however, that peer review is mandated by Congress when medical services are paid for 
with Medicare, see 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(k), (r), (s) (1982), and/or Medicaid, see 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(19), (26) (1982), funds, and 
also when hospitals seek certification for participation in the Medicare program by obtaining accreditation from the Joint 
Commission for the Accreditation of Hospitals, see 42 U.S.C. § 1395bb(a) (1982).  It is clear that Congress, by mandating 
hospital staff members or members of the local medical society to participate in the peer review process, see 42 U.S.C. § 
1395x(k)(2), accepts the potential anticompetitive effects of the medical peer review process in favor of quality medical care.  
See 49 Fed. Reg. 14977 (1984) (proposed rules to protect information of Peer Review Organizations); 49 Fed. Reg. 29026 
(1984) (revised rules for Peer Review Organizations).  Cf.  Pontius v. Children's Hospital, 552 F. Supp. at 1376 (Congress has 
attempted to improve the process of peer review through the Peer Review Improvement Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1320c-1 et seq. 
(1984))."
1245,21," Similarly, the administrative regulations of the Indiana Hospital Licensing Board provide that: ""THE GOVERNING BODY.  The governing board of the hospital shall be the supreme authority in the hospital, responsible 
for the management, operation, functioning, and control of the hospital.  The Governing Body shall:"
1245,*," * * (g) Approve the bylaws, rules, and regulations of the Medical Staff and audit procedures or other measures used to assure 
quality of care. (h) Appoint members of the Medical Staff and assign privileges consistent with their individual training, 
experience, and other qualifications on a periodic basis (at least every two (2) years) with the advice and recommendations 
of the organized Medical Staff."""
1245,410," Ind. Adm. Code 15-1-5 (Cumm. Supp. 1983). Furthermore: ""THE MEDICAL STAFF. (1) The Medical Staff of a hospital composed of two (2) or more physicians shall be an organized 
group which shall be responsible to the governing board for the clinical and scientific work of the hospital, advise regarding 
professional matters and policies to the governing board, or the board's designee, and shall have the responsibility of "
1246,," reviewing the professional practices in the hospital for the purpose of reducing morbidity and mortality, and for the 
improvement of the care of patients in the hospital.  This review shall include, but shall not be limited to, the quality and 
necessity of the care provided patients and the preventability of complications and deaths occurring in the hospital. (2) The medical staff shall initiate and, with the approval of the Governing Body, adopt and periodically amend bylaws, 
rules, regulations, and policies which shall include, but need not be limited to, provisions for: (a) Qualifications to be met for appointment to staff membership and for delineation of privileges."

related elements, and of total patient care."
1246,410, Ind. Adm. Code 15-1-7 (Cumm. Supp. 1983). 
1247,22," Similarly, the Indiana legislature amended Ind. Code § 16-10-1-6.5, effective April 22, 1983, to require that: ""The governing board shall report, in writing, to the Indiana medical licensing board the results and circumstances of any 
final, substantive, and adverse disciplinary action taken by the governing board regarding a physician on the medical staff, 
or an applicant for the medical staff, if the action results in voluntary or involuntary resignation, termination, 
nonappointment, revocation, or significant reduction of clinical privileges or staff membership."" Ind. Code Ann. § 16-10-1-6.5(b) (Burns Supp. 1983). "
1248,23," The Indiana legislature amended § 16-10-1-6.5, effective April 22, 1983, to provide that: ""The governing board and its employees, agents, consultants, and attorneys have absolute immunity from civil liability for 
communications, discussions, actions taken, and reports made concerning disciplinary action or investigation taken or 
contemplated, if such reports or actions are made in good faith and without malice."" Ind. Code Ann. § 16-10-1-6.5 (Burns Supp. 1983). "
1250,24," We here note Judge Fairchild's separate view that judicial economy is irrelevant in this context.  As he sees it, our decision is 
an interpretation of the state action doctrine of Federal antitrust law.  Our conclusion that the doctrine applies to the present 
situation does, of course, result in relieving the district court of this lawsuit, but in his view achievement of that result is not an 
appropriate consideration in reaching our conclusion. "
1252,25," We are cognizant of the district court's ruling that the plaintiffs did not allege sufficient ""state action"" to state a cause of action 
under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs did not appeal the district court's dismissal of their claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 nor was 
this court presented with any argument on the issue.  We note that the elements required for a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. 
§ 1983, a ""deprivation . . . caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the State"" and ""the party charged with the 
deprivation must be a person who may fairly be said to be a state actor,"" Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 937, 73 L. 
Ed. 2d 482, 102 S. Ct. 2744 (1982) differ from the elements required for state action under Parker.  We further note that the Fair

1283,1," Even to those uninitiated in the seasonal nuances of the college football game, the broad geographic span of the CFA member 
institutions, including schools such as Nebraska, Notre Dame, Boston College, Miami of Florida, Oklahoma, Texas, SMU, 
Alabama, Missouri, Brigham Young and Pittsburgh, reveals the imposing position the CFA occupies within the college football 
broadcast market."
1283,2," The legality of the Conference's crossover restriction is not at issue in this litigation in the absence of a cross-claim by the 
defendant.  Accordingly, a comparison of the two is unnecessary. "
1284,3," The preliminary injunction was issued on September 10, 1984 and had its initial impact on the first scheduled crossover game 
between Nebraska and UCLA which took place on September 22, 1984.  Faced with the terms of the preliminary injunction the 
University of Nebraska elected to give its consent to televising this game nationally on CBS rather than forgo any telecast. By 
not televising any college game during the Nebraska-UCLA telecast, ABC chose not to compete during this crossover match. "
1285,4," Admittedly, the reference to the ""serious questions"" presented as to the defendant's compliance with section one of the 
Sherman Act suggests that the district court may have utilized the short, two-part, ""alternative"" standard set forth in Benda v. 
Grand Lodge of IAM, 584 F.2d at 315, which requires a lesser showing of only a balance of hardships tipped sharply in the 
plaintiff's favor coupled with a ""fair chance of success on the merits"" or presenting questions ""serious enough to require 
litigation."" Nonetheless, the district court did expressly find that the public interest favored the issuance of the preliminary 
injunction, a finding consonant with the plenary inquiry outlined by the traditional test.  Hence, we review the district court's 
findings under the traditional standard. "
1287,5," In finding the NCAA television plan a ""horizontal"" restraint, 104 S. Ct. at 2959, the Supreme Court apparently reversed the 
Tenth Circuit's prior determination that the NCAA stood in a vertical relation to the networks. See Board of Regents v. NCAA, 
707 F.2d 1147, 1161 (10th Cir. 1983), aff'd on other grounds, 468 U.S. 85, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70, 104 S. Ct. 2948 (1984). We need not 
decide the effect of this inconsistency on this case at this juncture but we can readily infer which characterization will have the 
greater weight. "
1288,6," While at first blush this concern may appear remote, the importance of the national rankings, from the perspective of both the 
colleges and the networks, cannot be ignored.  In fact, the parties to both the ABC-CFA and the CBS-Conference contracts have 
taken great pains to insure that the televised college games are followed by promotional segments emphasizing the respective 
rank of the various teams and promoting the conference and inter-conference rivalries.  Obviously, if the parties devote so much 
attention to identifying the graphic detail to which national rankings will be promoted, we would be hard pressed to dismiss 
national rankings, and the networks' role in fostering them, as trivial. "
1290,7," Our disposition of the defendants' appeal from the district court's preliminary injunction should adequately clarify why we also 
find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's denial of a stay pending appeal.  Under a traditional, see Washington Area Transit 
Comm'n. v. Holiday Tours, Inc., 182 U.S. App. D.C. 220, 559 F.2d 841 (D.C. Cir. 1977), or abbreviated, Benda v. Grand Lodge 
of International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers, 584 F.2d 308, 315 (9th Cir. 1978), cert. dismissed, 441 U.S. 
937, 60 L. Ed. 2d 667, 99 S. Ct. 2065 (1979), standard for granting such a stay, we find no cause to disturb the trial court's 
ruling under Rule 62(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. "
1291,1," Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a) and 65(d) require specific findings when a preliminary injunction is granted.  The district court made only 
the limited findings quoted above.  As a result, we do not have the benefit of the complete and detailed reasoning of the district 
court."
1291,2," The defendants urge us to consider the fact that the plaintiffs' contract with CBS contains an exclusivity provision analogous to 
the provision at issue in this case.  In pari delicto is rarely, if ever, a defense to an antitrust action.  See 2 P. Areeda & D. Turner, 
Antitrust Law para. 348 (1978).  It does not follow, however, that the plaintiffs' actions are irrelevant to the granting of a 
preliminary injunction. The Second Circuit has stated: It is true that the in pari delicto doctrine is not a defense on the merits, . . . but the [plaintiff's practices] certainly can be 
taken into account in determining the equities as a prelude to ruling on a preliminary injunction, at least where a clear 
showing of ""public interest"" has not been made out.  Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. v. American Broadcasting Cos., 501 F.2d 894, 899 (2d Cir. 1974). The Second Circuit's 
approach is quite logical: a court should consider the actions of the plaintiff in evaluating claims of hardship. Although the 
plaintiffs argue that the exclusivity provision in the CBS contract is different from the exclusivity provision in the ABC contract, 
the district court found that it is ""not above suspicion."" This fact is useful in evaluating the merits of the plaintiffs' claim of 
hardship. The plaintiffs seek to distinguish Columbia Pictures on the ground that a ""clear showing of 'public interest'"" has been made in 
this case.  It should be noted that the Second Circuit did not limit its consideration of a party's conduct to cases in which the 
public interest is not clear.  Moreover, this argument misconceives the logic of the Second Circuit's approach.  The plaintiffs' 
conduct is a factor to be considered, not a bar to equitable relief.  Although it is conceivable that the public interest in granting a 
preliminary injunction could be so strong that it would be prudent to ignore the plaintiff's conduct, this case does not present 
such a situation.  As noted below, the public interest only marginally favors the granting of a preliminary injunction in this case. "
1292,3," This rule is subject to an exception for cases in which monetary damages either cannot be measured, see, e.g., Texas v. 
Seatrain International, S.A., 518 F.2d 175, 179 (5th Cir. 1975), or are otherwise inadequate, see, e.g., Semmes Motors, Inc. v. 
Ford Motor Co., 429 F.2d 1197, 1205 (2d Cir. 1970) (threat to business' existence).  See generally Note, Granting Preliminary 
Injunctions Against Dealership Terminations in Antitrust Actions, 67 Va. L. Rev. 1395, 1398-1401 (1981)."
1292,4," The plaintiffs also make the following argument: If ABC and the CFA succeed in blocking CBS' coverage of the USC-Notre Dame game, as well as other crossover games, 
CBS may determine that it is unable to continue to televise college football after this season. As a practical matter, the Pac-
10/Big Ten will have to join the CFA in order to have their games shown on national network television and ABC will have 
forced a competitor out of the market for network televising of intercollegiate football games. Although that argument is imaginative, it is too speculative for purposes of the injunction application.  Moreover, if the plaintiffs 
are correct, they can obtain money damages.  The preliminary injunction cannot be upheld on the basis of this argument."
1292,5," The recruiting efforts of UCLA are not at issue in light of the broadcast of the UCLA-Nebraska game. The Big Ten and the Pac-
10 cannot assert a conference-wide harm to recruiting unless they can show that the USC-Notre Dame game has a unique 
effect on the Conferences' ability to recruit athletes.  Such a showing has not been made.  Thus, only USC's recruiting efforts are 
at issue. "
1293,," Schedule A to the CBS-Big-10/Pac-10 letter agreement reveals that CBS plans to televise the USC-Washington game on 
November 10 and the USC-UCLA game on November 17.  It has been reported that USC will appear in eight televised games 
this year.  Newman, Greed and Glut?, Seattle Times, October 6, 1984, at D1, col. 6."
1293,6," The plaintiffs also argue that televising the football game would raise the USC football team's national ranking and would 
improve its chances of appearing in a post-season bowl game. This argument is utterly speculative.  Additionally, the plaintiffs 
note that televising football games makes it possible to operate large coeducational athletic programs.  Any such injury caused 
by the exclusivity provision is monetary."
1293,7," The Big-10 Conference can claim no harm under this theory because USC is not a Big-10 team. The Pac-10 Conference can 
claim no harm under this theory because it has no interest in insuring television exposure for USC, rather than another Pac-10 
team. The Pac-10 could have insured television coverage for its teams by scheduling an alternative game on the date in 
question.  USC can claim only minimal harm under this theory because, as discussed above, USC receives massive television 
coverage."
1293,8, See supra note 2.
1293,9," In addition to the exclusivity provision, the letter agreement provided that no Big-10 or Pac-10 team would appear on national 
television more than four times during the 1984 season.  An analogous provision is contained in article 13 of the Big Ten/Pacific-
10 Conference Football Television Plan."
1293,10," ABC and the CFA claim that the development of a strong national package is necessary in light of the availability of regional 
and local broadcasts. They note that games of peculiar local or regional interest, such as Brigham Young-Utah in Utah or 
California-Stanford in Berkeley will attract a much larger market share in those areas than a game of general national interest, 
such as USC-Notre Dame.  Accordingly, they assert that an exclusive national package is necessary to produce maximum 
advertising revenues. "
1294,11," Vertical price restraints are still illegal per se.  Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 104 S. Ct. 1464, 1469 
& n.7, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1984). See generally Liebeler, The Distinction Between Price and Nonprice Distribution Restrictions, 31 
UCLA L. Rev. 384 (1983). "
1295,12," The plaintiffs also resort to arguing by labels, calling the exclusivity provisions a ""group boycott"" and a ""cartel arrangement."" It 
is now well-established that those terms lack inherent meaning.  See R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 330-44 (1978).  It is the 
effect of the arrangement, rather than its form, that is relevant.  See generally, Bauer, Per Se Illegality of Concerted Refusals to 
Deal: A Rule Ripe for Reexamination, 79 Colum. L. Rev. 685 (1979)."
1295,13," The plaintiffs frequently allude to ABC's alleged plan to drive CBS out of the college television market.  Such a motivation does 
not by itself violate the Sherman Act. Regardless of ABC's intent, the plaintiffs must show that the exclusivity provision had an 
anticompetitive effect.  NCAA, 104 S. Ct. at 2962 & n.26; see Easterbrook, Is There a Ratchet in Antitrust Law?, 60 Texas L. 
Rev. 705, 708 (1982) (""Apparently-exclusionary conduct is of legitimate concern only if it works to drive out equally or more 
efficient rivals."").  Although the plaintiffs could bring an action for attempted monopolization, they have not done so.  In any 
event, such an action would fail for lack of a ""dangerous probability of success."" See 2 E. Kintner, Federal Antitrust Law § 13.4 
(1980).  It is inconceivable that ABC could monopolize the market in light of the presence of CBS, NBC, and the various cable 
networks."
1295,14," The plaintiffs claim that they are entitled to arrange for the broadcast of the game without the consent of Notre Dame, the 
CFA, or ABC because it will be played on USC's home field.  Regardless of the merits of that claim, the CBS contract purports to 
give CBS the exclusive right to televise the game in question."
1295,15," Of course, it is also possible that the game would be broadcast on local stations or by syndication.  Both contracts permit such 
broadcasts notwithstanding their exclusivity provisions.  Such broadcasts would alleviate any injury to the public interest. The plaintiffs argue that ABC would refuse to negotiate.  If that is the case, however, the plaintiffs' case under sections 1 and 2 
of the Sherman Act might be strengthened considerably. "
1296,16," Although the defendants have not yet filed a responsive pleading, it may ultimately be necessary to join CBS as a plaintiff in 
this case.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 19.  As is obvious from this discussion, CBS's rights may be adversely affected by the outcome of 
this litigation. "
1300,1," In their complaint, filed February 17, 1983, plaintiffs also named the Interstate Commerce Commission (""ICC"") as a party-
defendant.  Plaintiffs requested -- as a predicate to certain further relief against the ICC -- that the Court compel the ICC to reach 
a decision on a related matter pending before the agency.  In light of intervening developments and upon motion by the ICC, the 
Court on May 26, 1983 dismissed the action against the ICC as moot.  See Order of May 26, 1983.  The ICC is thus no longer a 
defendant in this suit. "
1301,2," Plaintiffs' ""Statement of Genuine Issues"" purports to dispute a number of material facts asserted by defendant.  Close 
comparison of plaintiffs' assertions discloses that while many of them challenge the implications or characterizations of 
defendant's statements, they do not effectively traverse them so as to put material facts into genuine dispute.  For example, 
plaintiffs state that they cannot ""accept[] as undisputed"" the statement by defendant that ""Atlas headquarters directs and 
coordinates [certain] agent activities."" PSGI P4, at 10-11.  Plaintiffs, thus, object that Atlas does not """"direct"" the performance of 
origin or destination services, in any direct supervisory sense."" Id. (emphasis added).  As suggested by the qualification at the 
end of the quotation, though, plaintiffs fail to dispute that Atlas does indeed have the authority to set the general terms according 
to which Atlas agents perform these functions for Atlas.  And indeed, plaintiffs concede that ""Atlas does coordinate the 
movement of trucks, to a substantial degree."" Id. at 11.  Throughout this memorandum, in citing to corresponding portions of 
plaintiffs and defendant's factual pleadings, the Court relies on the assertions therein to the extent that they reveal areas of 
agreement as described above, while disregarding any specific facts as to which the parties have succeeded in raising a 
genuine issue."
1301,3," The validity of the Atlas policy at issue in this case involves condiration of two separate statutory immunity provisions: 49 
U.S.C. §§ 11341-11342 (1982), and 49 U.S.C. § 10934(d) (1982).  The first of these provisions, 49 U.S.C. §§ 11341-11342, has 
relevance to the van line practice, described infra at pages 5-9, of allowing some agents (referred to as ""carrier-agents"") to 
possess and exercise their own independent interstate ICC authority in addition to acting as agents for the van line.  
Coordination between a van line and its carrier-agents has, under 49 U.S.C. § 11341-11342, long been immune from the federal 
antitrust laws provided that the van line and its carrier-agents enter into a ""pooling agreement"" meeting ICC approval.  See infra 
at page 7.  There is no dispute in this case as to the immunity provided by this provision. The second provision, 49 U.S.C. § 10934(d), was enacted in 1980 as part of Congress's deregulation of the household goods 
moving industry, see Pub. L. 96-454, § 5(a)(1), 94 Stat. 2013 (1980), and it is this provision that addresses, inter alia, the 
membership on a van line's board of directors of the van line's own agents.  Plaintiffs' do not dispute that, under the statute, the 
fact of such membership is immune from antitrust challenge.  See Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant's Motion 
for Summary Judgment at 18.  Yet the further scope of this immunity provision is disputed, and is discussed in detail infra at 
pages 19-23, 27.  The provision reads, in its entirety: "
1302,," The antitrust laws, as defined in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12), do not apply to discussions or agreements 
between a motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the [Interstate 
Commerce] Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title and its agents (whether or not an agent is also a carrier) 
related solely to (1) rates for the transportation of household goods under the authority of the principal carrier, (2) accessorial, 
terminal, storage, or other charges for services incidental to the transportation of household goods transported under the 
authority of the principal carrier, (3) allowances relating to transportation of household goods under the authority of the principal 
carrier, and (4) ownership of a motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of 
the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title by an agent or membership on board of directors of any such 
motor common carrier by an agent."
1302,49, U.S.C. § 10934(d) (1982).
1302,4, See supra note 3. 
1303,5," Agent operations for handling government or military traffic or exercising freight forwarding authority as referred to at PSGI P22 
constitute separate categories of business carried out under separate ICC authorities.  See Atlas Van Line, Inc., et al. -- Pooling 
Application, ICC Docket No. MC-F-15004 at 1-5 (July 15, 1983) (Defendant's Evidentiary and Other Materials 17).  While such 
shipments may also be carried within a van line's infrastructure, operations under these ancillary authorities are not affected by 
the Atlas policy being challenged in this suit and thus are not at issue. "
1304,6," See infra note 22.  The successive initiates were: a) January 27, 1979. Atlas began to require that carrier-agents pay to Atlas one percent of their revenues from the use of their 
independent authorities, in compensation for the benefits they received from Atlas in aid of their independent operations.  This 
requirement remained in effect until the last quarter of 1979.  PSF PPVI-A - VI-B; DRPF PPVI-A - VI-B. b) January 27, 1979. Atlas announced a policy -- effective immediately -- prohibiting an agent from acquiring any new interstate 
authority or applying to add to his present interstate authority.  Atlas states that despite its threats, it never enforced this policy, 
and publicly abandoned the policy by November, 1980.PSF PPVI-A, VI-C - VI-D; DRPF PPVI-A, VI-C - VI-D; DSF P45; PSGI 
P45. c) November 1, 1980. Atlas approved a tentative plan to purchase the independent authorities of its carrier-agents. The plan was 
soon abandoned without implementation.  PSF PPVI-F - VI-G, DRPF PPVI-F - VI-G. d) March 20, 1981. Atlas announced a plan that allowed agents freely to hold, increase, and use independent authority (without 
necessarily setting up a separate carrier company), but that banned any use of Atlas agents for origin and destination services in 
connection with shipments under such independent authority.  The plan was implemented on May 1, 1981.  After ICC objection 
that the plan require a new pooling agreement, the plan was abandoned on May 21, 1981.  PSF PPVI-H - VI-J; DRPF PPVI-H -

1306,11, The relevant Senate Report language reads in full: 
1307,," There is also a provision in the act that immunizes carriers and their agents from the antitrust laws with respect to certain 
dealings between them.  This section is needed in order to permit the continued relationships developed and approved over the 
years of certain van line companies. In some cases, van line companies are composed and owned by agents who themselves 
are carriers within limited geographical areas.  In some cases, the agents, as carriers themselves, have independent authority to 
operate in areas in which the principal carrier also be operate.  Accordingly, in the absence of immunity, there could be some 
problems concerning immunity from the antitrust laws. The bill merely permits existing relationships to continue. . . . S. Rep. 497, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 8 (1979) (emphasis supplied). Analagous language in the House Report on this legislation reads: New section 10934 also contains a provision which immunizes from the antitrust laws certain discussions exercise [sic] 
agreements between carriers and their agents related to rates, charges, and allowances for transportation provided under the 
authority of the carriers. Further, such discussions and agreements related to the ownership of a carrier by an agent or 
membership on the carrier's board of directors by an agent are immune. The purpose of this provision is to allow the continuation 
of certain relationships between carriers and agents which have been established over the years.  In some cases, the carriers 
are composed and owned by agents who themselves are carriers within limited geographical areas.  In other cases, the agents, 
as carriers themselves, have independent authority to operate in areas in which the principal carrier operates.  These 
relationships could be jeopardized in the absence of antitrust immunity. It is important to note that these exemptions are narrow 
ones.  Specifically, the immunity provided by subsections (d) (1)-(3) applies only to discussions or agreements related to rates, 
charges, and allowances offered on traffic carried under the authority of the principal carrier. Similarly, subsection (d)(4) provides 
only a limited exemption.  It does not exempt from the antitrust laws such things as anticompetitive mergers. H. Rep. 1372, 96th Congress, 1st Sess. at 10 (1979) (emphasis added). "
1308,12," The instance on such a showing is further supported by principles recently set forth by the Supreme Court's decisions in 
Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 104 S. Ct. 1464 (1984), and Copperweld, supra. In Monsanto, the Court indicated 
that a finding of conspiracy could not be sustained on the basis of evidence merely ""consistent"" with illegal coordination between 
a manufacturer and its independent distributors.  Rather, a plaintiff must proffer specific evidence ""inconsistent"" with the defense 
of unilaterality.  Monsanto, supra, at 1473. An analagous distinction provided the basis of the decision in Copperweld, where the 
Court rejected the proposition that a corporation can conspire with its separately incorporated but wholly owned subsidiary.  
Copperweld, supra, at 2742-45. The court observed that ""Coordination within a firm is as likely to result from an effort to compete 
as from an effort to stifle competition,"" id. at 2741, or, in other words, that the challenged behavior was, by itself, just as as 
""consistent"" with the ""effort to compete,"" legitimately, as it was with the ""effort to stifle competition."" The Court thus seems to 
suggest that in such circumstances, the antitrust laws can only be triggered by proffering evidence of behavior ""inconsistent"" 
with otherwise legitimate purposes. In the instant case, thus, the mere showing of a ""personal benefit"" traceable to an agent on the Atlas board of directors should 
not suffice to trigger the ""independent stake"" exception -- assuming one exists -- unless plaintiffs also proffer evidence showing 
that the personal benefit in question was inconsistent with or divergent from Atlas's own competitive interests.  There is a 
longstanding presumption that the members of a corporation's board of directors are incapable of conspiring with themselves 
under the Sherman Act in that there is no other way that a corporation can advance its competitive interests, see Nelson Radio, 
supra, and, thus, the Court is reluctant to find that the plaintiffs have demonstrated the existence of ""the plurality of actors 
imperative for a § 1 conspiracy,"" Copperweld, supra, at 2741, without a proffer of evidence suggesting that the personal benefits 
derived from the board's actions were inconsistent with or divergent from the interests of Atlas itself. "
1309,13," In Spray-Rite, supra, the Supreme Court confirmed the vitality of United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300 (1919). As the 
Court explained: Under Colgate, the manufacturer can announce its resale prices in advance and refuse to deal with those who fail to comply.  
And a distributor is free to acquiesce in the manufacturer's demand in order to avoid termination. Spray-Rite, supra, at 1469. The Colgate/Spray-Rite doctrine applies to non-price terms of dealing -- such as those in this case -- 
as well. "
1310,14," Plaintiffs theorize that the new policy tended to cause either of two outcomes: 1) agents abandoned or failed to seek 
independent authority under which they might have charged lower prices for moving services comparable to those that they 
were providing as Atlas agents, or 2) agents transferred their independent authority to separate corporations, and the additional 
cost of doing so dampened their ability to charge lower rates on the independent shipments."
1310,15," As noted, it is typical in the moving industry for the agents of a van line to enter into exclusive dealing agreements with the van 
line; i.e., they agree not to provide van line services to any company that is not also an agent of the van line that they serve.  
Plaintiffs argue that this practice should in this case be treated as an antitrust violation because it is an integral part of Atlas's 
alleged boycott and price maintenance schemes.  Though exclusive dealing arrangements are traditionally treated under the 
Rule of Reason, plaintiffs contend that here they should be treated as part of Atlas's other per se violations. "
1311,16," Cf.  North American Van Lines, Inc., v. I.C.C., 666 F.2d 1087, 1094-96 (7th Cir. 1981) (van line challenge against ICC 
regulations implemented after deregulation) (""There was no evidence before us regarding the customary arrangements . . . 
between national carriers and their agents.""); Clemmer v. North American Van Lines, Inc., 1969 Trade Cases P72,936, at 87609 
(E.D. Pa. 1969) (van line's allocation of exclusive territories between agents deemed not in violation of the antitrust laws) (policy 
in question did not affect carrier-agents' independent shipments)."
1311,17, The Senate Report discussion of this matter reads in full: 
1312,," During the Course of its deliberations, the Committee considered a proposal to include within the immunity section language that 
would grant immunity to agreements concerning exclusive agency representation, or the fiduciary duty of loyalty of an agent not 
to compete with the principal concerning the subject matter of the agency.  The Committee determined that this type of 
relationship is not a violation of the antitrust laws and is standard agency law as expressed in section 393 of the Restatement of 
the Law of Agencies section.  The Committee felt that inclusion of such language could imply that such relationships are a 
violation of the antitrust laws in the absence of immunity. Thus, the Committee determined not to include such language in the 
bill. S. Rep. 497, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 8 (1979).  Neither party makes any issue of the portion of this passage explaining that ""the 
Committee determined not to include"" language in the bill that might have immunized exclusive agency or fiduciary duty 
agreements directly.  Thus, it is not necessary to resolve any questions that might arise from the fact that such language was 
consciously excluded.  However, the Court is inclined to agree with the observation of the Senate Committee that ""this type of 
relationship is not a violation of the antitrust laws,"" id. Cf. Delta Data Systems Corp. v. Webster, No. 84-5356, slip op. at 8-9 
(D.C.Cir. Sept. 21, 1984) (valid to consider GAO report as persuasive even if not binding)."
1312,18," The House Report on the legislation states, under the heading ""Section 2.  Declaration of Policy,"" that: Section 2 sets forth congressional policy with respect to the household goods moving industry.  The emphasis in the policy 
statement is threefold -- the reduction of unnecessary regulation, the strengthening of consumer remedies and protections, and 
the establishment of maximum carrier flexibility in pricing their services and meeting the needs of their shippers. H. Rep. 1372, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 5 (1979) (emphasis added).  See also S. Rep. 497, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 8 (1979) (""The bill 
merely permits existing carrier-agent relationship to continue."" (emphasis added)). "
1313,19," It is worth noting, in this regard, that one other major van line has determined to accept the costs of permitting its carrier-
agents to shift their established names to such newly created separate entities. See DSF P79.Counsel for the defendant may 
themselves yet decide, out of an abundance of caution and in anticipation of a possible appeal, to recommend to Atlas the 
adoption of this more conservative approach."
1313,20," Plaintiffs themselves report that ""Allied Van Lines, the largest van line, allows no firm affiliated with it to have or to use 
authority to conduct interstate operations competitive with its own.  This arrangement was approved and immunized from the 
antitrust laws by the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1946, following an antitrust action suit brought by the Justice 
Department.  Evanston Fireproof Warehouse, et al., - Control - Allied Van Lines, 46 M.C.C. 557 (1946)."" PSF PIII-I."
1313,21," The court does not itself face the question, nor intimate any ruling, on whether indeed it would be valid under the antitrust laws 
for a van line to take the more extreme step of banning its agents even from having separate affiliates exercise independent 
carrier authority.  Suffice it to note that plaintiffs, having conceded that a van line is entitled to take such extreme action, see 
Transcript of Hearing, August 6, 1984, at 19-23, are in no position to argue that Atlas's less extreme action is unreasonable.  
Given that Atlas bars only the exercise of independent authority by the agency companies themselves, the policy goes no farther 
than is necessary to enforce traditional agency standards upon the agent companies alone.  The discussion above 
demonstrates the reasonableness of a policy that is limited in this fashion. "
1314,22," To the extent that plaintiffs' claims also challenge Atlas's earlier, aborted efforts to cope with the advent of deregulation, see 
supra note 6, the Court similarly finds that no violation of the rule of reason can be demonstrated.  Even apart from whether the 
""conspiracy"" requirement can be met as to these earlier Atlas actions, the Court finds that their short duration, the prerogative of 
Atlas to impose traditional agency standards upon its agents, and the procompetitive aim of the actions establish that they 
cannot be deemed ""unreasonable"" under the Sherman Act. "

922, 4 L. Ed. 2d 742, 80 S. Ct. 676 (1960), on which the district court relied, suggested that the lack of a demand could be an 
alternative basis for affirming a district court conclusion that no injury had been sustained by plaintiffs, it has been undermined 
by the later Supreme Court cases.  In any event, in that case there was a general lack of evidence that defendants frustrated 
what might have been a successful business venture and caused any damage.  See id. at 153. The question of the necessity of 
a demand under section 4 of the Clayton Act was reserved by the court in Weiss v. York Hospital, supra, Slip Op. at 40 n.32,

1335,1," In this area of law both courts and commentators have been inconsistent in their use of terminology. For purposes of clarity, I 
use the term ""claim preclusion"" to describe the preclusive effect of a judgment on the merits between parties or their privies in 
the same cause of action.  ""Issue preclusion"" or ""collateral estoppel"" describes the preclusive effect of a prior judgment on an 
issue of law or fact in a different cause of action involving a party. ""Res judicata"" is a general term which applies to both types of 
preclusion."

Moreover, the events which plaintiff complained of took place primarily in the summer of 1979, years before judgment was

1369,8," The court need not decide, for purposes of this motion, whether plaintiff must prove that a defendant has market power in order 
to support a rule of reason antitrust claim. Plaintiff, relying upon N.C.A.A. v. Board of Regents, 468 U.S. 85, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 
2965, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1984), contends that market power need not be proved. Defendants, relying upon General Leaseways v. 
National Truck Leasing, 744 F.2d 588, 1984-2 Trade Cases para. 66,205 (7th Cir.1984) and the proposed Department of Justice 
guidelines concerning vertical restraints (see Mr. Popofsky's November 1, 1984, letter to this court), argue that plaintiff cannot 
avoid summary judgment because it offers no proof that any defendant has market power.  This court need not decide that 
issue. In this case plaintiff has not shown a conspiracy, actual injury to competition or market power."
1369,9," As one antitrust writer has stated: In some cases, the evidence adduced may not permit the court confidently to decide the question of market definition. For 
example, the plaintiff's prima facie definition and defendant's rebuttal definition might both be plausible. In that situation, the 
parties would do well to present -- and the trier of fact to consider -- other evidence of market power that might assist the 
court in deciding which market definition is the more appropriate. Harris & Jorde, Antitrust Market Definition: An Integrated Approach, 72 Cal.L.Rev. 1, 66 (1984). This court adds that it may in 
fact find, after considering the commercial realities of the situation, that some market definition other than that advanced by the 
parties is the most appropriate. It is the facts and realities of the situation that establish the actual market -- not the desires or 
wishes of the parties. Unlike most controversies where the parties might stipulate as to the facts surrounding the lawsuit, in 
antitrust cases, it is market competition that the court is concerned with, not competitors. "
1370,10," Plaintiff contended, in oral argument on this motion, that it may aggregate defendants' market shares to establish market 
power. It is not clear whether plaintiff contends that it may aggregate one defendant's share of several markets or that it may 
aggregate all the station defendants' market shares to establish market power. If plaintiff seeks to aggregate one defendant's 
share of more than one market, it has offered no factual evidence or legal argument which would permit such aggregation in this 
case. If plaintiff seeks to aggregate all the station defendants' market shares to establish market power, it may not do so. As 
noted above, plaintiff does not claim, and the evidence does not show, that the defendants conspired. Absent a conspiracy 
among defendants, plaintiff may not aggregate the respective market shares of individual defendants to establish market power. 
If a plaintiff could do so, it could merely sue all its competitors in a given market, aggregate their shares, and thus unfailingly 
establish market power."
1370,11, See note 8 supra. 
1371,12," This, of course, again assumes that plaintiff has produced evidence of injury to competition. "
1372,13," Contrary to plaintiff's argument, there is no evidence showing that a supplier's revenues would be increased by licensing a 
program, for example M*A*S*H, to both a station defendant and plaintiff. Plaintiff's argument seems to be based upon the faulty 
assumption that the station defendant would pay the same price as it currently pays for a program which is not exclusive against 
plaintiff. The evidence shows, however, that a station defendant would not pay the same price, but a substantially lower one. 
There is no evidence showing that the combined prices paid by a station defendant and plaintiff for the same show would 
exceed the price currently paid by the station defendant for a license which is exclusive against plaintiff. The evidence, in fact, 
indicates the contrary. See, e.g., argument of Jessica Pers, supplier defendants' attorney, at August 9, 1984, hearing, and 
deposition evidence cited immediately after note 13 in the text, supra. "
1373,14," Even if plaintiff offered stronger evidence to prove unreasonableness, the court might still find the practices reasonable as a 
matter of law where, as here, the facts are undisputed and the court is only required to apply the proper legal standard of 
""reasonableness"" to those undisputed facts. See, Continental T.V., Inc.  v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 694 F.2d 1132, 1135 (9th 
Cir.1982); c.f., II P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law para. 315 (1978); Schwarzer, Summary Judgment Under the Federal 
Rules: Defining Genuine Issues of Material Fact, 99 F.R.D. 465, 469-77 (1984)."
1373,15," See, Efigenio Declaration; Bell Deposition Exhibit 6; Thurston Deposition Exhibit 41; Wischmeyer Deposition Exhibit 17. This 
evidence shows that the defendants' exclusivity practices are different, not identical. Such evidence supports a finding that the 
defendants' conduct was not ""parallel."" See, e.g., Du Pont Glore Forgan, Inc. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 437 F. 
Supp. 1104, 1125 (S.D.N.Y.1977), aff'd mem., 578 F.2d 1366 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 970, 99 S. Ct. 465, 58 L. Ed. 2d

1385,3," In a letter on December 19, 1978, to the National Association of Realtors seeking their ""legal muscle"", Black explained the 
rationale underlying the commission on custom homes: It is vitally important to this marketing program and to the builders involved that any custom houses built in the area carry 
the same costs of this marketing program as the speculative houses with which it competes.  If this were not true, the 
builder would find that his speculative houses were being used as models to build custom houses.  Thus, the speculative 
house would stand on the market while the customer saved the sales commission by going across the street to build a 
custom house. "

1413,*," Honorable Reynaldo G. Garza, U.S. Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit, sitting by designation."
1413,1," Jurisdiction for plaintiffs' antitrust claims was predicated on 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 & 1337 (1982).  Jurisdiction for plaintiffs' breach 
of contract and tortious interference with contract claims was based on 28 U.S.C. § 1332 (1982) and the district court's pendent 
jurisdiction."
1413,2," In their ad damnum clause at the end of their complaint, plaintiffs prayed for $20 million in punitive damages, presumably as to 
each of their three claims for relief.  Charter's counterclaim also sought punitive damages, in the sum of $100000."
1413,3," The court summarily dismissed Patterson's antitrust claims on the defendants' motions prior to trial. It directed a verdict for 
Columbia on Patterson's tortious interference with contract claim at trial, at the close of plaintiffs' case.  See infra text at slip op. 
p. 6. "
1414,4," Patterson told Kuehnert that he could get at least 750 of NITE's members to guarantee a minimum rental. He estimated that 
each guarantee would average about $2,000 and that, collectively, they would approximate $2 million.  Presumably, these 
guarantees would inure to the benefit of Charter's investors, serving indirectly to underwrite their provision of production costs."
1414,5," It is undisputed that these negotiators contemplated a written contract between Charter and NITE.  Each party had retained 
counsel and they were to reduce the negotiators' understanding to writing.  Charter's lawyer advised Charter not to accept the 
negotiators' proposal, and Charter followed that advice. NITE had no experience in distributing motion pictures, and the 
exhibitors' commitments would be worthless.  To enforce those commitments, Charter would have had to sue the exhibitors in 
their jurisdictions, and considering the exhibitors' limited exposure the litigation expenses would have been prohibitive."
1414,6, See supra note 5. 
1417,7," The Georgia Statute of Frauds, codified as Ga. Code § 13-5-30 (1982), provides in relevant part:"

] Agreements required to be in writing. To make the following obligations binding on the promisor, the promise must be in writing and signed by the party to be 
charged therewith or some person lawfully authorized by him: (5) Any agreement that is not to be performed within one year from the making thereof; . . . ."
1417,8," It is clear that, under Georgia law, if both parties to a contract are capable of performing within one year, the contract is outside 
the statute of frauds.  Henderson v. Touchstone, 22 Ga. 14 (1857); Weems v. Assoc. Life Ins. Co., 154 Ga. App. 552, 269 
S.E.2d 57, 59 (1980); Klag v. Home Insurance Co., 116 Ga. App. 678, 158 S.E.2d 444, 451 (1967). These cases should not 
necessarily be read, however, as requiring that both parties be capable of performing within a year in order for the contract to be 
outside the statute of frauds; thus they need not be read as overturning the holding in Johnson v. Watson, 1 Ga. 348 (1846). If, 
however, Georgia law does require that both parties be capable of performing within one year in order for the contract to be 
outside the statute of frauds, the contract before us clearly could not have met this more stringent requirement.  For, as we 
demonstrate infra, it would have been nearly impossible for even one of the parties, NITE, to have performed within one year. "
1421,*," The Honorable Samuel H. Bell, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio, sitting by designation. "
1422,1, The alleged tying arrangement is also said to contribute to this problem. 
1423,2," Although not required to do so, most franchisees finance their inventories through Southland because the company charges 
lower interest rates than regular lending institutions. "
1424,3," In the recent Monsanto Co., case, the Solicitor General of the United States filed an amicus curiae brief urging the Court to 
reconsider the per se violation rule adopted in Dr. Miles Medical Co. The Court refused to consider this argument on the ground 
that the defendants had not presented it either in the district court or on appeal.  We note that Southland has not challenged the 
per se violation rule at any time during this litigation. "
1425,4," The plaintiffs assert that they need not prove coercion, citing Albrecht.  The Supreme Court stated in that case, however, that a 
plaintiff may assert a ""combination"" between a defendant and himself ""as of the day [plaintiff] unwillingly complied."" 390 U.S. at 
150 n.6 (emphasis supplied).  Consequently, Albrecht supports the notion that coercion must be demonstrated in a private action 
brought under a vertical price fixing theory."
1425,5," We reiterate that the plaintiffs have not argued that retail inventory accounting systems are inherently suspect under the 
antitrust laws.  Although the requirement of reporting retail price changes and initially reporting retail prices being charged on 
items purchased from nonrecommended vendors might constrain retail pricing discretion, not every vertical arrangement 
affecting prices necessarily violates the Sherman Act. See Lewis Service Center, Inc. v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 714 F.2d 842, 846 
(8th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1226, 104 S. Ct. 2678, 81 L. Ed. 2d 873 (1984); AAA Liquors, 705 F.2d at 1205. Since the 
plaintiffs have only argued that one element of Southland's retail inventory accounting system was created with the intent to fix 
prices, we do not consider the rest of the system. "
1426,6," Although DeCarlo also charges that Southland ""deliberately"" made the payments late, we disregard that allegation because 
DeCarlo could not have personal knowledge of the company's ulterior motives.  In reviewing the affidavits, we have disregarded 
all similar comments about Southland's purported motives.  This does not mean, however, that Southland's objective conduct is 
not evidence of coercion or of an intent to fix prices."
1426,7," Although DeCarlo recounts a similar incident occurring in 1982, the Southland representative in question was reprimanded at a 
meeting attended by DeCarlo.  While Southland's reaction to this incident certainly is evidence that it has not engaged in 
coercion, we do not agree with Southland either that the plaintiffs' affidavits allege only isolated or unauthorized actions that do 
not amount to coercion as a matter of law, see Belk-Avery, 457 F. Supp. at 1335, or that there is no issue of material fact on the 
coercion issue. "
1428,8," We do not address the other reasons relied upon by the district court in granting summary judgment on the tying arrangement 
claim."
1428,9," We do not address the issue of whether a business entity must be affiliated with organized crime in order to be liable for 
damages in a private civil RICO action. "

court, we treat the evidence presented to the district court in the light most favorable to the nonmovant plaintiffs.  Adickes v. S.H.

1452,1," The Government took the position that ""once Cyanamid files an affidavit stating that the divestiture of Formica has in fact been 
completed in accordance with the terms supplied in these proceedings, the Court should enter an Order terminating the Final 
Judgment"" (Memorandum filed November 9, 1984, p. 2). Essentially, the Government also expresses its own independent 
conclusion in the same memorandum that ""Cyanamid is accurate in representing to the Court that divestiture will transform 
Formica into 'a fully independent company '."" Id. p. 4. "

changes in his surroundings to do so."" Paul A.  Samuelson, Economics, at 44 (10 ed. 1976) (""the method [or raw material] that is "
1454,," the cheapest at any one time because of both physical efficiency and cost efficiency, will displace a more costly method [or raw 
material]. The only way for producers to meet price competition and maximize profits is to keep costs at a minimum by adopting 
the most efficient methods""). P. Areeda and D. Turner, Antitrust Law, paras. 1000-109 (1980); Robert Bork, The Antitrust

1455,3," The cash financing necessary, $175.1 Million Dollars, will come from sources independent of Cyanamid. Each party has 
separate outside counsel in connection with the divestiture, and separate investment bankers. "
1457,4," Since 1982 the Government has taken a position that a phase-out period for the purchase requirement is ""not warranted or 
appropriate."" (Government Memorandum filed November 9, 1984 at p. 11, fn. 15). "
1458,5," We do not suggest that this is the sole motive for selling the Formica Division; there are obviously economic benefits flowing 
from the divestiture apart from the elimination of the purchase obligations of the Judgment. Whatever the Judgment provides, it 
does not require Cyanamid to remain in the laminate business forever; probably any such provision would be unconstitutional, if 
not void for vagueness or impossibility."
1458,6," Cyanamid's hardship is largely self-created since it was foreseeable that the Court of Appeals might reverse in Cyanamid I, as 
it did, and that certiorari might be denied by the Supreme Court, as it was. "

1464,3," On the federal level, the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13a, is somewhat similar to these sales-below-cost statutes,

prior to the date of sale, offer for sale or advertisement for sale, as the case may be, in the quantity last purchased, 
whichever is lower, from either of which there shall be deducted all trade discounts, except customary discounts for cash, 
and (ii) to either of which there shall be added the following items of expense: ""(1) Freight charges not otherwise included in the cost of the article, product or item of merchandise, but which freight 
charges shall not be construed as including cartage to retail outlet if done or paid for by the retailer; ""(2) A markup to cover, in part, the cost of doing business, which markup in the absence of proof of a lesser cost, shall be 
seven percent of the aggregate of invoice cost or replacement cost (whichever is used), less trade discounts as aforesaid, 
and plus said freight charges."" Subsection (b) defines ""cost"" for a wholesaler and is substantially the same, except the markup for the cost of doing business is

1468,10," It is quite possible that a full evidentiary hearing could establish that the exclusion of customary cash discounts has a 
substantial effect on the cost equation, thereby rendering the equation completely arbitrary and irrational. Under our least 
intrusive remedy doctrine, such a finding would only require us to strike this portion of the cost formulation and not the entire Act.

1473,16," Trade associations have been prosecuted either under the Sherman Act or Federal Trade Commission regulations for 
attempting to stabilize prices or set minimum prices under the guise of enforcing a state sales-below-cost statute.  Since only the 
retailer or wholesaler can possibly know what its own costs are, any attempt by a trade association to inform retailers and 
wholesalers what their costs should be for a particular product, with an implied threat of prosecution under the state sales-below-
cost statute, could possibly subject the association to an antitrust action.  In such an event, the fact that the association was 
attempting to enforce a sales-below-cost statute would not be a valid defense.  See generally Schnapps Shop, Inc. v. H.W.
