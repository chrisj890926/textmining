386,"10  If the complaint had not explained that the claim of agreement rested on the parallel conduct described, we doubt that the If the complaint had not explained that the claim of agreement rested on the parallel conduct described, we doubt that the  complaint's references to an agreement among the ILECs would have given the notice required by  Rule 8 .

This lack of notice contrasts sharply with the model form for pleading negligence, Form 9, which the  dissent says exemplifies the kind of ""bare allegation"" that survives a motion to dismiss.   Post, at 576, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 953 .   Whereas the model form alleges that the defendant struck the plaintiff with his car while plaintiff was crossing a particular  highway at a specified date and time, the complaint here furnishes no clue as to which of the four ILECs (much less which of  their employees) supposedly agreed, or when and where the illicit agreement took place.  A defendant wishing to prepare an  answer in the simple fact pattern laid out in Form 9 would know what to answer; a defendant seeking to respond to plaintiffs'  conclusory allegations in the  ยง 1  context would have little idea where to begin."

There, the plaintiffs failed adequately to allege loss causation, a required element in a private securities fraud action.  Because it  alleged nothing more than that the prices of the securities the plaintiffs purchased were artificially inflated, the  Dura  complaint  failed to ""provid[e] the defendants with notice of what the relevant economic loss might be or of what the causal connection  might be between that loss and the [alleged] misrepresentation.""   Id., at 347, 125 S. Ct. 1627, 161 L. Ed. 2d 577 .  Here, the  failure the majority identifies is not a failure of notice--which ""notice pleading"" rightly condemns--but rather a failure to satisfy the  Court that the agreement alleged might plausibly have occurred.  That being a question not of  notice  but of  proof , it should not  be answered without first hearing from the defendants (as apart from their lawyers). Similarly, in  Associated Gen. Contractors of  Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983) , in which we also found an antitrust complaint  wanting, the problem was not that the injuries the plaintiffs alleged failed to satisfy some threshold of plausibility, but rather that  the injuries as alleged were not ""the type that the antitrust statute was intended to forestall.""   Id., at 540, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L.  Ed. 2d 723 ; see  id., at 526, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L.

The remedy for an allegation lacking sufficient specificity to provide  adequate notice is, of course, a  Rule 12(e)  motion for a more definite statement.  See  Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.

Quite the contrary:  An  allegation that competitors meet on a regular basis, like the allegations of parallel conduct, is consistent with--though not  sufficient to prove--the plaintiffs' entirely serious and unequivocal allegation that the defendants entered into an unlawful  agreement.

Ed. 2d, at 943 , is no  reason to throw the baby out with the bathwater.  The Court vastly underestimates a district court's case-management arsenal.   Before discovery even begins, the court may grant a defendant's  Rule 12(e)  motion;  Rule 7(a)  permits a trial court to order a  plaintiff to reply to a defendant's answer, see  Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 598, 118 S. Ct. 1584, 140 L. Ed. 2d 759  (1998) ; and  Rule 23  requires ""rigorous analysis"" to ensure that class certification is appropriate,  General Telephone Co. of  Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161, 102 S. Ct. 2364, 72 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1982) ; see  In re Initial Public Offering Securities  Litigation, 471 F.3d 24 (CA2 2006)  (holding that a district court may not certify a class without ruling that each  Rule 23   requirement is met, even if a requirement overlaps with a merits issue).   Rule 16  invests a trial judge with the power, backed by  sanctions, to regulate pretrial proceedings via conferences and scheduling orders, at which the parties may discuss,  inter alia ,  ""the elimination of frivolous claims or defenses,""  Rule 16(c)(1) ; ""the necessity or desirability of amendments to the pleadings,""  Rule 16(c)(2) ; ""the control and scheduling of discovery,""  Rule 16(c)(6) ; and ""the need for adopting special procedures for  managing potentially difficult or protracted actions that may involve complex issues, multiple parties, difficult legal questions, or  unusual proof problems,""  Rule 16(c)(12) .  Subsequently,  Rule 26  confers broad discretion to control the combination of  interrogatories, requests for admissions, production requests, and depositions permitted in a given case; the sequence in which  such discovery devices may be deployed; and the limitations imposed upon them.  See  523 U.S., at 598-599, 118 S. Ct. 1584,  140 L. Ed. 2d 759 .  Indeed,  Rule 26(c)  specifically permits a court to take actions ""to protect a party or person from annoyance,  embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense"" by, for example, disallowing a particular discovery request, setting  appropriate terms and conditions, or limiting its scope. In short, the Federal Rules contemplate that pretrial matters will be settled  through a flexible process of give and take, of proffers, stipulations, and stonewalls, not by having trial judges screen allegations "

Even aside from the District Court's reasoning,  App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a-85a, it seems quite unlikely that AT&T would have an antitrust duty to deal with the plaintiffs.  Such a  duty requires a showing of monopoly power, but--as the FCC has recognized,  In re Appropriate Framework for Broadband  Access to Internet Over Wireline Facilities, 20 FCC Rcd. 14853, 14879-14887  --the market for high-speed Internet service is  now quite competitive; DSL providers face stiff competition from cable companies and wireless and satellite providers."

Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416 (CA2 1945)   ( Alcoa ).  In that case, the Government alleged that Alcoa was using its monopoly power in the upstream aluminum ingot market  to squeeze the profits of downstream aluminum sheet fabricators.  The court concluded:  ""That it was unlawful to set the price of  'sheet' so low and hold the price of ingot so high, seems to us unquestionable, provided, as we have held, that on this record the  price of ingot must   [****26]  be regarded as higher than a 'fair price.'""

See Brief for Petitioners 43. When  Brulotte  was decided, those agreements counted as  per se  antitrust violations and patent misuse; now, they are unlawful only if  the patent holder wields power in the relevant market. See Act of Nov. 19, 1988, ยง201, 102 Stat. 4676 (adding the  market  [****21]   power requirement in the patent-misuse context);  Illinois Tool Works Inc. v.

But it is far from clear that the old rule of tying was among  Brulotte โs legal underpinnings.  Brulotte   briefly analogized post-expiration royalty agreements to tying arrangements, but only after relating the statutory and caselaw  basis for its holding and โconclud[ing]โ that post-patent royalties are โunlawful  per se .โ  379 U.S., at 32, 85 S.

Congress took the lead in changing the treatment of tying agreements and, in doing so,  conspicuously left  Brulotte  in place. Indeed, Congress declined to enact bills that would have modified not only tying doctrine but  also  Brulotte . See  supra, at ___, 192 L. Ed. 2d, at 472  (citing S. 1200, 100th Cong., 1st Sess.

Ed. 2d 445  (agreement between competing dentists not to share X rays with insurance  companies);  Catalano, supra, at 644-645, 650, 100 S. Ct. 1925, 64 L. Ed. 2d 580  (agreement among competing wholesalers not  to compete on extending credit to retailers). Given that horizontal restraints involve agreements between competitors not to  compete in some way, this Court concluded that it did not need to precisely define the relevant market to conclude that these  agreements were anticompetitive. See  Indiana Federation of Dentists, supra, at 460-461, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 ;  Catalano, supra, at 648-649, 100 S. Ct. 1925, 64 L. Ed. 2d 580 . But vertical restraints are different. See  Arizona v. Maricopa  County Medical Soc., 457 U. S. 332, 348, n. 18, 102 S. Ct. 2466, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48 (1982) ;  Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc.  v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U. S. 877, 888, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 (2007) .  HN7 [ ]  LEdHN[7] [ ] [7] Vertical restraints often  pose no risk to competition unless the entity imposing them has market power, which cannot be evaluated unless the Court first  defines the relevant market. See  id., at 898, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623  (noting that a vertical restraint โmay not be a  serious concern unless the relevant entity has market powerโ); Easterbrook, Vertical Arrangements and the Rule of Reason, 53  Antitrust L. J. 135, 160 (1984) (โ[T]he possibly anticompetitive manifestations of vertical arrangements can occur only if there is  market powerโ)."
728,"8  Contrary to the dissentโs assertion, Contrary to the dissentโs assertion,  post, at ___ - ___, 201 L. Ed. 2d, at 703 , merchant services and cardholder services are not  complements. See Filistrucchi 297 (โ[A] two-sided market [is] different from markets for complementary products, in which both  products are bought by the same buyers, who, in their buying decisions, can therefore be expected to take into account both  pricesโ). As already explained, HN10 [ ]  LEdHN[10] [ ] [10] credit-card companies are best understood as supplying only one  productโtransactionsโwhich is jointly consumed by a cardholder and a merchant. See Klein 580. Merchant services and  cardholder services are both inputs to this single product. See  ibid."
728,"9  Nontransaction platforms, by contrast, often do compete with companies that do not operate on both sides of their platform. A Nontransaction platforms, by contrast, often do compete with companies that do not operate on both sides of their platform. A  newspaper that sells advertising, for example, might have to compete with a television network, even though the two do not  meaningfully compete for viewers. See Filistrucchi 301."
731,"10  The plaintiffs argue that The plaintiffs argue that  United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U. S. 596, 610, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972) ,  forbids any restraint that would restrict competition in part of the marketโhere, for example, merchant steering. See Brief for  Petitioners and Respondents Nebraska, Tennessee, and Texas 30, 42.  Topco  does not stand for such a broad proposition.  Topco  concluded that a horizontal agreement between competitors was unreasonable  per se , even though the agreement did  not extend to every competitor in the market. See  405 U. S., at 599, 608, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 . A horizontal  agreement between competitors is markedly different from a vertical agreement that incidentally affects one particular method of  competition. See  Leegin, 551 U. S., at 888, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 ;  Maricopa County Medical Soc., 457 U. S., at  348, n. 18, 102 S. Ct. 2466, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48 ."

Ed. 2d, at 809 . Under our normal rule of construction, a plaintiff whoโs not proximately harmed by a defendantโs  unlawful conduct has no cause of action to sue the defendant for any type of relief.  Lexmark Intโl, Inc. v. Static Control  Components, Inc., 572 U. S. 118, 135, 134 S. Ct. 1377, 188 L. Ed. 2d 392 (2014)  (although a plaintiff that โcannot quantify its  losses with sufficient certainty to recover damages . . . may still be entitled to injunctive relief,โ the requirement of proximate  causation โmust be met in every caseโ)."

They didnโt mention the 99- cent rule in their complaint in district court or in their briefs to the court of appeals. And, as Iโve noted, they concede that they are  seeking damages โbased solely onโ the 30% commission. Brief in Opposition 5."

Ante, at ___, 203 L. Ed. 2d, at 813 . But Apple charged only one  commission on each sale. So even assuming for argumentโs sake that the 30% commission was entirely illegal, Apple can only  be required to pay out in damages, at most, the full amount it received in commissions. To their credit, even plaintiffs have  conceded as much, acknowledging that because โthere is only  one 30% markup ,โ any claim by the developers against Apple  would necessarily be seeking โa piece of the same 30% pie.โ Brief in Opposition 12. Itโs a mystery why the Court refuses to  accept that sensible concession."
