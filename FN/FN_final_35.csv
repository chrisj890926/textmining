             App. 8 (Cal. Complaint P4.a)."
  19 ,2     ," Following the lower courts and the parties, see In re Insurance Antitrust Litigation, 938 F.2d 919, 924, 925 (CA9 1991), we will
             treat the complaint filed by California as representative of the claims of Alabama, Arizona, California, Massachusetts, New York,
             West Virginia, and Wisconsin, and the complaint filed by Connecticut as representative of the claims of Alaska, Colorado,
             Connecticut, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington. As will
             become apparent, the California and Connecticut Complaints differ slightly in their presentations of background information and
             their claims for relief; their statements of facts are identical. Because the private party plaintiffs have chosen in their brief in this
             Court to use the California Complaint as a ""representative model"" of their claims, Brief for Respondents (Private Party Plaintiffs) "
  20 ,3     ," , n.6, we will assume that their complaints track that complaint. On remand, the courts below will of course be free to take into
             account any relevant differences among the complaints that the parties may bring to their attention."
  20 ,3     ," The First Claim for Relief in the Connecticut Complaint, App. 88-90 (PP115-119), charges all the defendants with an
             overarching conspiracy to force all four of these changes on the insurance market. The eight federal-law Claims for Relief in the
             California Complaint, id., at 36-49 (PP111-150), charge various subgroups of the defendants with separate conspiracies that had
             more limited objects; not all of the defendants are alleged to have desired all four changes. "
  21 ,4     ," The First Claim for Relief in the Connecticut Complaint, id., at 88-90 (PP115-119), charging an overarching conspiracy
             encompassing all of the defendants and all of the conduct alleged, is a special case. See n. 18, infra. "
  22 ,5     ," The California and Connecticut Complaints' Statements of Facts describe this conspiracy as involving ""specialized reinsurers in
             London and the United States."" App. 34 (P106); id., at 87 (Conn. Complaint P110). The claims for relief, however, name only
             London reinsurers; they do not name any of the domestic defendants who are the petitioners in No. 91-1111. See id., at 48
             (P147); id., at 96 (Conn. Complaint P136). Thus, we assume that the domestic reinsurers alleged to be involved in this
             conspiracy are among the ""unnamed co-conspirators"" mentioned in the complaints. See id., at 48 (Cal. Complaint P147); id., at
             96 (Conn. Complaint P136). "

             Fifth Claims for Relief in the Connecticut Complaint."
  23 ,8     ," We limited our grant of certiorari in No. 91-1111 to these questions: ""1. Whether domestic insurance companies whose conduct
             otherwise would be exempt from the federal antitrust laws under the McCarran-Ferguson Act lose that exemption because they
             participate with foreign reinsurers in the business of insurance,"" and ""2. Whether agreements among primary insurers and
             reinsurers on such matters as standardized advisory insurance policy forms and terms of insurance coverage constitute a
             'boycott' outside the exemption of the McCarran-Ferguson Act."" Pet. for Cert. in No. 91-1111, p. i; see 506 U.S. 814 (1992)."
  23 ,9     ," The question presented in No. 91-1128 is: ""Did the court of appeals properly assess the extraterritorial reach of the U.S.
             antitrust laws in light of this Court's teachings and contemporary understanding of international law when it held that a U.S.
             district court may apply U.S. law to the conduct of a foreign insurance market regulated abroad?"" Pet. for Cert. in No. 91-1128,
             p. i. "
  25 ,10    ," The activities in question here, of course, are alleged to violate federal law, and it might be tempting to think that unlawful acts
             are implicitly excluded from ""the business of insurance."" Yet § 2(b)'s grant of immunity assumes that acts which, but for that
             grant, would violate the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, or the Federal Trade Commission Act, are part of ""the business of
             insurance."""
  25 ,11    ," We also cited two cases dealing with the immunity of certain agreements of labor unions under the Clayton and Norris-
             LaGuardia Acts. See 440 U.S. at 231-232. These cases, however, did not hold that labor unions lose their immunity whenever
             they enter into agreements with employers; to the contrary, we acknowledged in one of the cases that ""the law contemplates
             agreements on wages not only between individual employers and a union but agreements between the union and employers in
             a multi-employer bargaining unit."" Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 664, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585 (1965).
             Because the cases stand only for the proposition that labor unions are not immune from antitrust liability for certain types of
             agreements with employers, such as agreements ""to impose a certain wage scale on other bargaining units,"" id., at 665, they do
             not support the far more general statement that exempt entities lose immunity by conspiring with nonexempt entities. "
  26 ,12    ," The Court of Appeals's assumption that ""the American reinsurers . . . are subject to regulation by the states and therefore
             prima facie immune,"" 938 F.2d at 928, appears to rest on the entity-based analysis we have rejected. As with the foreign
             reinsurers, we express no opinion whether the activities of the domestic reinsurers were ""regulated by State Law"" and leave that
             question to the Court of Appeals on remand."
  26 ,20    ," As we have noted, see supra, at 776-777, each of these claims has a counterpart in the Connecticut Complaint. The claims
             each name different groups of London reinsurers, and not all of the named defendants are petitioners in No. 91-1128; but
             nothing in our analysis turns on these variations."
  26 ,21    ," One of the London reinsurers, Sturge Reinsurance Syndicate Management Limited, argues that the Sherman Act does not
             apply to its conduct in attending a single meeting at which it allegedly agreed to exclude all pollution coverage from its
             reinsurance contracts. Brief for Petitioner Sturge Reinsurance Syndicate Management Ltd. in No. 91-1128, p. 22. Sturge may
             have attended only one meeting, but the allegations, which we are bound to credit, remain that it participated in conduct that was
             intended to and did in fact produce a substantial effect on the American insurance market. "
  27 ,22    ," JUSTICE SCALIA believes that what is at issue in this litigation is prescriptive, as opposed to subject-matter, jurisdiction. Post,
             at 813-814. The parties do not question prescriptive jurisdiction, however, and for good reason: it is well established that
             Congress has exercised such jurisdiction under the Sherman Act. See G. Born & D. Westin, International Civil Litigation in
             United States Courts 542, n. 5 (2d ed. 1992) (Sherman Act is a ""prime example of the simultaneous exercise of prescriptive
             jurisdiction and grant of subject matter jurisdiction"")."
  27 ,23    ," Under § 402 of the Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act of 1982 (FTAIA), 96 Stat. 1246, 15 U.S. C. § 6a, the Sherman
             Act does not apply to conduct involving foreign trade or commerce, other than import trade or import commerce, unless ""such
             conduct has a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect"" on domestic or import commerce. § 6a(1)(A). The FTAIA
             was intended to exempt from the Sherman Act export transactions that did not injure the United States economy, see H. R. Rep.
             No. 97-686, pp. 2-3, 9-10 (1982); P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P236'a, pp. 296-297 (Supp. 1992), and it is
             unclear how it might apply to the conduct alleged here. Also unclear is whether the Act's ""direct, substantial, and reasonably
             foreseeable effect"" standard amends existing law or merely codifies it. See id., P236'a, p. 297. We need not address these
             questions here. Assuming that the FTAIA's standard affects this litigation, and assuming further that that standard differs from
             the prior law, the conduct alleged plainly meets its requirements."
  27 ,24    ," JUSTICE SCALIA contends that comity concerns figure into the prior analysis whether jurisdiction exists under the Sherman
             Act. Post, at 817-818. This contention is inconsistent with the general understanding that the Sherman Act covers foreign
             conduct producing a substantial intended effect in the United States, and that concerns of comity come into play, if at all, only
             after a court has determined that the acts complained of are subject to Sherman Act jurisdiction. See United States v. Aluminum
             Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416, 444 (CA2 1945) (""It follows from what we have . . . said that [the agreements at issue] were
             unlawful [under the Sherman Act], though made abroad, if they were intended to affect imports and did affect them"");
             Mannington Mills, Inc. v. Congoleum Corp., 595 F.2d 1287, 1294 (CA3 1979) (once court determines that jurisdiction exists
             under the Sherman Act, question remains whether comity precludes its exercise); H. R. Rep. No. 97-686, supra, at 13. But cf.
             Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of America, N. T. & S. A., 549 F.2d 597, 613 (CA9 1976); 1 J. Atwood & K. Brewster, Antitrust
             and American Business Abroad 166 (1981). In any event, the parties conceded jurisdiction at oral argument, see supra, at 795,
             and we see no need to address this contention here. "
  28 ,25    ," JUSTICE SCALIA says that we put the cart before the horse in citing this authority, for he argues it may be apposite only after
             a determination that jurisdiction over the foreign acts is reasonable. Post, at 821. But whatever the order of cart and horse,
             conflict in this sense is the only substantial issue before the Court."
  28 ,*     ," JUSTICE O'CONNOR, JUSTICE KENNEDY, and JUSTICE THOMAS join this opinion in its entirety, and THE CHIEF JUSTICE
             joins Part I of this opinion. "
  29 ,1     ," Section 3(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1013(b), provides: ""Nothing contained in this Act shall render the said Sherman Act in-applicable to any agreement to boycott, coerce, or intimidate,
             or act of boycott, coercion, or intimidation."" "
  30 ,2     ," Under the Oxford English Dictionary definition, of course, this example would not be a ""boycott"" because the tenants had not
             suspended all relations with the Captain. But if one recognizes partial boycotts (as we and JUSTICE SOUTER do), and if one
             believes (as JUSTICE SOUTER does but we do not) that the purpose of a boycott can be to secure different terms in the very
             transaction that is the supposed subject of the boycott, then it is impossible to explain why this is not a boycott. Under JUSTICE
             SOUTER's reasoning, it would be a boycott, at least if the tenants acted ""at the behest of"" (whatever that means), ante, at 792,
             the Irish Land League. This hypothetical shows that the problems presented by partial boycotts (which we agree fall within §
             3(b)) make more urgent the need to distinguish boycotts from concerted agreements on terms."
  30 ,3     ," JUSTICE SOUTER points out that the Court in St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Barry, 438 U.S. 531, 57 L. Ed. 2d 932, 98 S.
             Ct. 2923 (1978), found the term ""boycott"" ""does not refer to '""a unitary phenomenon,""'"" ante, at 788 (quoting Barry, supra, at 543
             (quoting P. Areeda, Antitrust Analysis 381 (2d ed. 1974))), and asserts that our position contradicts this. Ante, at 793-794. But to
             be not a ""unitary phenomenon"" is different from being an all-encompassing one. ""Boycott"" is a multifaceted ""phenomenon"" that
             includes conditional boycotts, punitive boycotts, coercive boycotts, partial boycotts, labor boycotts, political boycotts, social
             boycotts, etc. It merely does not include refusals to deal because of objections to proposed terms."

  32 ,6     ," Once it is determined that the actions of the reinsurers did not constitute a ""boycott,"" but rather a concerted agreement to
             terms, it follows that their actions do not constitute ""coercion"" or ""intimidation"" within the meaning of the statute. That is because,
             as previously mentioned, such concerted agreements do ""not coerce anyone, at least in the usual sense of that word,"" L.
             Sullivan, Law of Antitrust 257 (1977), and because they are precisely what is protected by McCarran-Ferguson immunity. "
  34 ,7     ," We agree with JUSTICE SOUTER's conclusion, ante, at 790-791, n. 18, that the Seventh Claim for Relief in the California
             Complaint and the Sixth Claim for Relief in the Connecticut Complaint fail to allege any § 3(b) boycotts."

             Ferguson Act was precipitated by our holding in South-Eastern Underwriters that the business of insurance was interstate
             commerce and thus subject generally to federal regulation under the Commerce Clause, and to scrutiny under the Sherman Act
             specifically. Congress responded, both to ""ensure that the States would continue to have the ability to tax and regulate the
             business of insurance,"" Royal Drug Co., 440 U.S. at 217-218 (footnote omitted), and to limit the application of the antitrust laws
             to the insurance industry, id., at 218. In drafting the § 3(b) exception to the § 2(b) grant of antitrust immunity, Congress borrowed
             language from our description of the indictment in South-Eastern Underwriters as charging that ""the conspirators not only fixed
             premium rates and agents' commissions, but employed boycotts together with other types of coercion and intimidation to force
             nonmember insurance companies into the conspiracies."" 322 U.S. at 535."

             McCarran-Ferguson Act indicates that the insurance companies thought otherwise. ""We say 'You do not issue insurance to a
             company that does not do business the way we think it should be done and belong to our association.' . . . It is for the protection
             of the public, the stockholders, and the companies . . . . You know when those large risks are taken that they have to be
             reinsured. We do not want to have to take a risk that is bad, or at an improper rate, or an excessive commission, we do not want
             our agents to take that, nor do we want to reinsure part of the risk that is written that way. We feel this way -- that some groups
             are doing business in what is not the proper way, we feel it is not in the interest of the companies and it is not in the interest of
             the public, and we just do not want to do business with them."" Joint Hearing on S. 1362, H. R. 3269, and H. R. 3270 before the

             Williams, President, Insurance Executives Association)."
  36 ,17    ," In passing the McCarran-Ferguson Act, Justice Stewart argued, ""Congress plainly wanted to allow the States to authorize
             anticompetitive practices which they determined to be in the public interest."" St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Barry, 438 U.S.
             531, 565, 57 L. Ed. 2d 932, 98 S. Ct. 2923 (1978) (dissenting opinion). Hence, § 2(b) provides that the federal antitrust laws will
             generally not be applicable to those insurance business practices ""regulated by State law,"" and presumably state law could, for
             example, either mandate price fixing, or specifically authorize voluntary price-fixing agreements. On the other hand, Congress
             intended to delegate regulatory power only to the States; nothing in the McCarran-Ferguson Act suggests that Congress wanted
             one insurer, or a group of insurers, to be able to formulate and enforce policy for other insurers. Thus, the enforcement activities
             that distinguish § 3(b) ""boycotts"" from other concerted activity include, in this context, ""private enforcement . . . of industry rules
             and practices, even if those rules and practices are permitted by state law."" Id., at 565-566 (emphasis in original) (footnote

  37 ,18    ," The First and Sixth Claims for Relief in the Connecticut Complaint, and the Seventh Claim for Relief in the California
             Complaint, which also name some or all of the petitioners, present special cases. The First Claim for Relief in the Connecticut
             Complaint alleges an overarching conspiracy involving all of the defendants named in the complaint and all of the conduct
             alleged. As such, it encompasses ""boycott"" activity, and the Court of Appeals was correct to reverse the District Court's order
             dismissing it. As currently described in the complaint's statement of facts, however, some of the actions of the reinsurers and the
             retrocessional reinsurers appear to have been taken independently, rather than at the behest of the primary insurer defendants. I
             express no opinion as to whether those acts, if they were indeed taken independently, could amount to § 3(b) boycotts; but I
             note that they lack the key element on which I rely in this litigation to find a sufficient allegation of boycott. The Seventh Claim for Relief in the California Complaint, and the virtually identical Sixth Claim for Relief in the Connecticut
             Complaint, allege a conspiracy among a group of domestic primary insurers, foreign reinsurers, and the ISO to draft restrictive
             model forms and policy language for ""umbrella"" and ""excess"" insurance. On these claims, the Court of Appeals reversed the
             District Court's order of dismissal as to the domestic defendants solely because those defendants ""acted in concert"" with
             nonexempt foreign defendants, 938 F.2d, at 931, relying on reasoning that the Court has found to be in error, see supra, at 781-
             784. The Court of Appeals found that ""no boycotts [were] alleged as the defendants' modus operandi in respect to [excess and
             umbrella] insurance."" 938 F.2d, at 930. I agree; even under a liberal construction of the complaints in favor of plaintiffs, I can find
             no allegation of any refusal to deal in connection with the drafting of the excess and umbrella insurance language. Therefore I
             conclude that neither the participation of unregulated parties nor the application of § 3(b) furnished a basis to reverse the District
             Court's dismissal of these claims as against the domestic insurers, and I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in
             this respect. The Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Claims for Relief in the California Complaint and the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Claims for
             Relief in the Connecticut Complaint also allege concerted refusals to deal; but because they do not name any of the petitioners
             in No. 91-1111, the Court has no occasion to consider whether they allege § 3(b) boycotts. "
  38 ,19    ," The majority contends that its concept of boycott is still ""multifaceted"" because it can be modified by such adjectives as
             ""punitive,"" ""labor,"" ""political,"" and ""social."" Post, at 804, n. 3. This does not hide the fact that it is attempting to concoct a ""precise

  41 ,9     ," Some antitrust courts, including the Court of Appeals in the present cases, have mistaken the comity at issue for the ""comity of

             into today. Because courts are generally reluctant to refuse the exercise of conferred jurisdiction, confusion on this seemingly
             theoretical point can have the very practical consequence of greatly expanding the extraterritorial reach of the Sherman Act. "

  68 ,2     ," Even to speak of ""the Commerce Clause"" perhaps obscures the actual scope of that Clause. As an original matter, Congress
             did not have authority to regulate all commerce; Congress could only ""regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the
             several States, and with the Indian Tribes."" U.S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 3. Although the precise line between interstate/foreign "
  69 ,      ," commerce and purely intrastate commerce was hard to draw, the Court attempted to adhere to such a line for the first 150 years
             of our Nation. See infra, at 593-599."
  69 ,3     ," There are other powers granted to Congress outside of Art. I, § 8, that may become wholly superfluous as well due to our
             distortion of the Commerce Clause. For instance, Congress has plenary power over the District of Columbia and the territories.
             See U.S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 17, and Art. IV, § 3, cl. 2. The grant of comprehensive legislative power over certain areas of the
             Nation, when read in conjunction with the rest of the Constitution, further confirms that Congress was not ceded plenary
             authority over the whole Nation. "
  70 ,4     ," Cf. 3 Debates 40 (E. Pendleton at the Virginia convention) (The proposed Federal Government ""does not intermeddle with the
             local, particular affairs of the states. Can Congress legislate for the state of Virginia? Can [it] make a law altering the form of

  72 ,5     ," None of the other Commerce Clause opinions during Chief Justice Marshall's tenure, which concerned the ""dormant""
             Commerce Clause, even suggested that Congress had authority over all matters substantially affecting commerce. See Brown v.
             Maryland, 25 U.S. 419, 12 Wheat. 419, 6 L. Ed. 678 (1827); Willson v. Black Bird Creek Marsh Co., 2 Pet. 245 (1829). "
  73 ,6     ," It is worth noting that Congress, in the first federal criminal Act, did not establish nationwide prohibitions against murder and the
             like. See Act of Apr. 30, 1790, ch. 9, 1 Stat. 112. To be sure, Congress outlawed murder, manslaughter, maiming, and larceny,
             but only when those acts were either committed on United States territory not part of a State or on the high seas. Ibid. See U.S.
             Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 10 (authorizing Congress to outlaw piracy and felonies on high seas); Art. IV, § 3, cl. 2 (plenary authority
             over United States territory and property). When Congress did enact nationwide criminal laws, it acted pursuant to direct grants
             of authority found in the Constitution. Compare Act of Apr. 30, 1790, supra, §§ 1 and 14 (prohibitions against treason and the
             counterfeiting of U.S. securities), with U.S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 6 (counterfeiting); Art. III, § 3, cl. 2 (treason). Notwithstanding
             any substantial effects that murder, kidnaping, or gun possession might have had on interstate commerce, Congress understood
             that it could not establish nationwide prohibitions. Likewise, there were no laws in the early Congresses that regulated manufacturing and agriculture. Nor was there any statute
             that purported to regulate activities with ""substantial effects"" on interstate commerce. "
  74 ,7     ," To be sure, congressional power pursuant to the Commerce Clause was alternatively described less narrowly or more narrowly
             during this 150-year period. Compare United States v. Coombs, 12 Pet. 72, 78 (1838) (commerce power ""extends to such acts,
             done on land, which interfere with, obstruct, or prevent the due exercise of the power to regulate [interstate and international]
             commerce"" such as stealing goods from a beached ship), with United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U.S. 1, 13, 39 L. Ed. 325,
             15 S. Ct. 249 (1895) (""Contracts to buy, sell, or exchange goods to be transported among the several States, the transportation
             and its instrumentalities . . . may be regulated, but this is because they form part of interstate trade or commerce""). During this
             period, however, this Court never held that Congress could regulate everything that substantially affects commerce. "
  75 ,8     ," Although I might be willing to return to the original understanding, I recognize that many believe that it is too late in the day to
             undertake a fundamental reexamination of the past 60 years. Consideration of stare decisis and reliance interests may convince
             us that we cannot wipe the slate clean."
  75 ,9     ," Nor can the majority's opinion fairly be compared to Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 49 L. Ed. 937, 25 S. Ct. 539 (1905).
             See post, at 604-609 (SOUTER, J., dissenting). Unlike Lochner and our more recent ""substantive due process"" cases, to-day's
             decision enforces only the Constitution and not ""judicial policy judgments."" See post, at 607. Notwithstanding JUSTICE
             SOUTER's discussion, ""'commercial' character"" is not only a natural but an inevitable ""ground of Commerce Clause distinction.""
             See post, at 608 (emphasis added). Our invalidation of the Gun-Free School Zones Act therefore falls comfortably within our
             proper role in reviewing federal legislation to determine if it exceeds congressional authority as defined by the Constitution itself.
             As John Marshall put it: ""If [Congress] were to make a law not warranted by any of the powers enumerated, it would be
             considered by the judges as an infringement of the Constitution which they are to guard . . . . They would declare it void."" 3

 178 ,5     ," JUSTICE BREYER says, post, at 10, that ""Congress enacted [the] language [of § 201(b)] in 1938,"" and that whether it confers
             ""general authority to make rules implementing the more specific terms of a later enacted statute depends upon what that later
             enacted statute contemplates."" That is assuredly true. But we think that what the later statute contemplates is best determined,
             not by speculating about what the 1996 Act (and presumably every other amendment to the Communications Act since 1938)
             ""foresees,"" ibid., but by the clear fact that the 1996 Act was adopted, not as a freestanding enactment, but as an amendment to,
             and hence part of, an Act which said that ""the Commission may prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary in the
             public interest to carry out the provisions of this Act."" JUSTICE BREYER cannot plausibly assert that the 1996 Congress was
             unaware of the general grant of rulemaking authority contained within the Communications Act, since § 251(i) specifically
             provides that ""nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or otherwise affect the Commission's authority under section
             201."" "
 179 ,6     ," JUSTICE BREYER appeals to our cases which say that there is a ""'presumption against the pre-emption of state police power
             regulations,'"" post, at 10, quoting from Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 518, 120 L. Ed. 2d 407, 112 S. Ct. 2608
             (1992), and that there must be ""'clear and manifest' showing of congressional intent to supplant traditional state police powers,""
             post, at 10, quoting from Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230, 91 L. Ed. 1447, 67 S. Ct. 1146 (1947). But the
             question in these cases is not whether the Federal Government has taken the regulation of local telecommunications
             competition away from the States. With regard to the matters addressed by the 1996 Act, it unquestionably has. The question is
             whether the state commissions' participation in the administration of the new federal regime is to be guided by federal-agency
             regulations. If there is any ""presumption"" applicable to this question, it should arise from the fact that a federal program
             administered by 50 independent state agencies is surpassing strange. The appeals by both JUSTICE THOMAS and JUSTICE BREYER to what might loosely be called ""States' rights"" are most
             peculiar, since there is no doubt, even under their view, that if the federal courts believe a state commission is not regulating in
             accordance with federal policy they may bring it to heel. This is, at bottom, a debate not about whether the States will be allowed
             to do their own thing, but about whether it will be the FCC or the federal courts that draw the lines to which they must hew. To be
             sure, the FCC's lines can be even more restrictive than those drawn by the courts -- but it is hard to spark a passionate ""States'
             rights"" debate over that detail. "
 180 ,7     ," We discuss the Louisiana case because of the light it sheds upon the meaning of § 152(b). We of course do not agree with
             JUSTICE BREYER's contention, post, at 11, that the case ""raised a question almost identical to the one before us."" That case
             involved the Commission's attempt to regulate services over which it had not explicitly been given rulemaking authority; this one
             involves its attempt to regulate services over which it has explicitly been given rulemaking authority."
 180 ,8     ," LEdHN[8B][
             ] [8B] Because this reasoning clearly gives separate meanings to the provisions ""apply"" and ""give the Commission jurisdiction,"" we do
             not understand why JUSTICE THOMAS asserts, post, at 9-10, that we have not given effect to every word that Congress used.
             Nor do we agree with JUSTICE THOMAS that our interpretation renders § 152(b) a nullity. See post, at 9. After the 1996 Act, §
             152(b) may have less practical effect. But that is because Congress, by extending the Communications Act into local
             competition, has removed a significant area from the States' exclusive control. Insofar as Congress has remained silent,
             however, § 152(b) continues to function. The Commission could not, for example, regulate any aspect of intrastate
             communication not governed by the 1996 Act on the theory that it had an ancillary effect on matters within the Commission's
             primary jurisdiction. JUSTICE THOMAS admits, as he must, that the Commission has authority to implement at least some portions of the 1996 Act.
             See post, at 7. But his interpretation of § 152(b) confers such inflexibility upon that provision that he must strain to explain where
             the Commission gets this authority. A number of the provisions he relies on plainly read, not like conferrals of authority, but like
             references to the exercise of authority conferred elsewhere (we think, of course, in § 201(b)). See, e.g.,  § 251(b)(2) (assigning
             state commissions ""the duty to provide, to the extent technically feasible, number portability in accordance with requirements
             prescribed by the Commission""); § 251(d)(2) (setting forth factors for the Commission to consider ""in determining what network
             elements should be made available for purposes of subsection (c)(3)""); § 251(g) (requiring that any pre-existing ""regulation,
             order, or policy of the Commission"" governing exchange access and interconnection agreements remain in effect until it is
             ""explicitly superseded by regulations prescribed by the Commission""). Moreover, his interpretation produces a most chopped-up
             statute, conferring Commission jurisdiction over such curious and isolated matters as ""number portability, . . . those network
             elements that the carrier must make available on an unbundled basis for purposes of § 251(c), . . . numbering administration, . . .
             exchange access and interconnection requirements in effect prior to the Act's effective date, . . . and treatment of comparable
             carriers as incumbents . . . ,"" post, at 7, but denying Commission jurisdiction over much more significant matters. We think it
             most unlikely that Congress created such a strange hodgepodge. And, of course, JUSTICE THOMAS's recognition of any FCC
             jurisdiction over intrastate matters subjects his analysis to the same criticism he levels against us, post, at 10: Just as it is true
             that Congress did not explicitly amend § 152(b) to exempt the entire 1996 Act, neither did it explicitly amend § 152(b) to exempt
             the five provisions he relies upon. "
 181 ,9     ," JUSTICE THOMAS says that the grants of authority to the Commission in § 251 would have been unnecessary ""if Congress
             believed . . . that § 201(b) provided the FCC with plenary authority to promulgate regulations."" Post, at 9. We have already
             explained that three of the five provisions on which JUSTICE THOMAS relies are not grants of authority at all. See n. 8, supra.
             And the remaining two do not support his argument because they are not redundant of § 201(b). HN11[
             ] Section 251(e), which provides that ""the Commission shall create or designate one or more impartial entities to administer telecommunications
             numbering,"" requires the Commission to exercise its rulemaking authority, as opposed to § 201(b), which merely authorizes the
             Commission to promulgate rules if it so chooses. Section 251(h)(2) says that the FCC ""may, by rule, provide for the treatment of
             a local exchange carrier . . . as an incumbent local exchange carrier for purposes of [§ 251]"" if the carrier satisfies certain
             requirements. This provision gives the Commission authority beyond that conferred by § 201(b); without it, the FCC certainly
             could not have saddled a nonincumbent carrier with the burdens of incumbent status. "
 182 ,10    ," JUSTICE THOMAS notes that it is well settled that state officers may interpret and apply federal law, see, e.g., United States
             v. Jones, 109 U.S. 513, 27 L. Ed. 1015, 3 S. Ct. 346 (1883), which leads him to conclude that there is no constitutional
             impediment to the interpretation that would give the States general authority, uncontrolled by the FCC's general rulemaking
             authority, over the matters specified in the particular sections we have just discussed. Post, at 12-13. But constitutional
             impediments aside, we are aware of no similar instances in which federal policymaking has been turned over to state
             administrative agencies. The arguments we have been addressing in the last three paragraphs of our text assume a scheme in
             which Congress has broadly extended its law into the field of intrastate telecommunications, but in a few specified areas
             (ratemaking, interconnection agreements, etc.) has left the policy implications of that extension to be determined by state
             commissions, which -- within the broad range of lawful policymaking left open to administrative agencies -- are beyond federal
             control. Such a scheme is decidedly novel, and the attendant legal questions, such as whether federal courts must defer to state
             agency interpretations of federal law, are novel as well. "
 184 ,11    ," JUSTICE SOUTER points out that one can say his ability to replace a light bulb is ""impaired"" by the absence of a ladder, and
             that a ladder is ""necessary"" to replace the bulb, even though one ""could stand instead on a chair, a milk can, or eight volumes of
             Gibbon."" True enough (and nicely put), but the proper analogy here, it seems to us, is not the absence of a ladder, but the
             presence of a ladder tall enough to enable one to do the job, but not without stretching one's arm to its full extension. A ladder
             one-half inch taller is not, ""within an ordinary and fair meaning of the word,"" post, at 4, ""necessary,"" nor does its absence ""impair""
             one's ability to do the job. We similarly disagree with JUSTICE SOUTER that a business can be impaired in its ability to provide
             services -- even impaired in that ability ""in an ordinary, weak sense of impairment,"" post, at 5 -- when the business receives a
             handsome profit but is denied an even handsomer one. "

             conclusion that the FCC lacks such authority carries considerable force. "
 193 ,4     ," My conclusion applies with equal force to other FCC regulations that trump the state commissions' responsibilities, including
             exemptions, suspensions, and modification, § 251(f); approval of agreements predating the Act, § 252(a); and pre-emption of

             ] [6B] This conclusion is consistent with holdings by a number of Courts of Appeals. In FTC v. National Comm'n on Egg Nutrition,
             supra, the Court of Appeals held that a nonprofit association ""organized for the profit of the egg industry,"" 517 F.2d at 488, fell
             within the Commission's jurisdiction. In American Medical Assn. v. FTC, supra, the Court of Appeals held that the ""business
             aspects,"" 517 F.2d at 448, of the AMA's activities brought it within the Commission's reach. These cases are consistent with our
             conclusion that an entity organized to carry on activities that will confer greater than de minimis or presumed economic benefits
             on profit-seeking members certainly falls within the Commission's jurisdiction. In Community Blood Bank v. FTC, supra, the
             Court of Appeals addressed the question whether the Commission had jurisdiction over a blood bank and an association of
             hospitals. It held that ""the question of the jurisdiction over the corporations or other associations involved should be determined
             on an ad hoc basis,"" 134 F.3d at 1018, and that the Commission's jurisdiction extended to ""any legal entity without shares of
             capital which engages in business for profit within the traditional meaning of that language,"" ibid. (emphasis deleted). The Court
             of Appeals also said that ""according to a generally accepted definition 'profit' means gain from business or investment over and
             above expenditures, or gain made on business or investment where both receipts or payments are taken into account,"" 134 F.3d
             at 1017, although in the same breath it noted that the term's ""meaning must be derived from the context in which it is used,"" 134
             F.3d at 1016. Our decision here is fully consistent with Community Blood Bank, because the CDA contributes to the profits of at
             least some of its members, even on a restrictive definition of profit as gain above expenditures. (It should go without saying that
             the FTC Act does not require for Commission jurisdiction that members of an entity turn a profit on their membership, but only
             that the entity be organized to carry on business for members' profit.) Nonetheless, we do not, and indeed, on the facts here,
             could not, decide today whether the Commission has jurisdiction over nonprofit organizations that do not confer profit on for-
             profit members but do, for example, show annual income surpluses, engage in significant commerce, or compete in relevant
             markets with for-profit players. We therefore do not foreclose the possibility that various paradigms of profit might fall within the
             ambit of the FTC Act. Nor do we decide whether a purpose of contributing to profit only in a presumed sense, as by enhancing
             professional educational efforts, would implicate the Commission's jurisdiction."

             parties, I agree with the Court that we should give the Court of Appeals the first opportunity to reconsider the § 1962(a) claim.

 359 ,2     ," Sutherland's treatise on damages, on which the Court relied in Holmes, labels the same type of claims indirect: those where
             one party is injured, and it is that very injury--and not the wrongful behavior by the tortfeasor--that causes the injury to the
             plaintiff.  See 1 J. Sutherland, Law of Damages 55 (1882) (hereinafter Sutherland).  Indeed, every example cited in Sutherland in
             illustration of this principle parallels Holmes; the plaintiff would not be injured absent the injury to another victim.  See Sutherland
             55-56. "
 360 ,3     ," Indeed, in Associated General Contractors, we did not even squarely hold that the reason that indirect damages are not
             compensable was that the damages were not easily ascertainable; instead, we merely recognized the empirical fact that ""[p]artly
             because it is indirect, and partly because the alleged effects on the Union may have been produced by independent factors, the
             Union's damages claim is also highly speculative.""  459 U.S., at 542, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723."
 360 ,4     ," Sutherland described the interrelation between the two concepts: ""A fatal uncertainty may infect a case where an injury is easily
             provable, but the alleged responsible cause cannot be sufficiently established as to the whole or some part of that injury.  So it
             may exist where a known and provable wrong or violation of contract appears, but the alleged loss or injury as a result of it
             cannot be certainly shown."" Sutherland 94."
 360 ,5     ," Nor is it fair to require a plaintiff to prove that the tort caused the lowering of prices at the motion to dismiss stage.  Ideal's
             complaint alleges that petitioners ""pass on to National's customers the sales tax 'savings' that National realizes as a result of its
             false returns."" App. 16.  This allegation that, as a factual matter, National was able to charge a lower price after tax because of
             its fraud suffices to permit Ideal to survive a motion to dismiss on the question whether the prices were lowered due to the fraud,
             as opposed to other factors. "

             Defendants and their co-conspirators engaged in a contract, combination or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry in their

 381 ,3     ," The dissent greatly oversimplifies matters by suggesting that the Federal Rules somehow dispensed with the pleading of facts
             altogether.  See post, at 580, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 955 (opinion of Stevens, J.) (pleading standard of Federal Rules ""does not
             require, or even invite, the pleading of facts"").  While, for most types of cases, the Federal Rules eliminated the cumbersome
             requirement that a claimant ""set out in detail the facts upon which he bases his claim,"" Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S.
             Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957) (emphasis added), Rule 8(a)(2) still requires a ""showing,"" rather than a blanket assertion, of
             entitlement to relief.  Without some factual allegation in the complaint, it is hard to see how a claimant could satisfy the
             requirement of providing not only ""fair notice"" of the nature of the claim, but also ""grounds"" on which the claim rests.  See 5
             Wright & Miller § 1202, at 94, 95 (Rule 8(a) ""contemplate[s] the statement of circumstances, occurrences, and events in support

             existence of the alleged conspiracy and class certification.""  Post, at 593, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 963.  But determining whether some
             illegal agreement may have taken place between unspecified persons at different ILECs (each a multibillion dollar corporation
             with legions of management level employees) at some point over seven years is a sprawling, costly, and hugely time-consuming
             undertaking not easily susceptible to the kind of line-drawing and case management that the dissent envisions.  Perhaps the
             best answer to the dissent's optimism that antitrust discovery is open to effective judicial control is a more extensive quotation of
             the authority just cited, a judge with a background in antitrust law.  Given the system that we have, the hope of effective judicial
             supervision is slim:  ""The timing is all wrong.  The plaintiff files a sketchy complaint (the Rules of Civil Procedure discourage
             fulsome documents), and discovery is launched.  A judicial officer does not know the details of the case the parties will present
             and in theory cannot know the details.  Discovery is used to find the details.  The judicial officer always knows less than the
             parties, and the parties themselves may not know very well where they are going or what they expect to find.  A magistrate
             supervising discovery does not--cannot--know the expected productivity of a given request, because the nature of the
             requester's claim and the contents of the files (or head) of the adverse party are unknown.  Judicial officers cannot measure the
             costs and benefits to the requester and so cannot isolate impositional requests.  Requesters have no reason to disclose their
             own estimates because they gain from imposing costs on rivals (and may lose from an improvement in accuracy).  The portions
             of the Rules of Civil Procedure calling on judges to trim back excessive demands, therefore, have been, and are doomed to be, "
 384 ,      ," hollow.  We cannot prevent what we cannot detect; we cannot detect what we cannot define; we cannot define 'abusive'
             discovery except in theory, because in practice we lack essential information.""  Easterbrook, Discovery as Abuse, 69 B. U. L.
             Rev. 635, 638-639 (1989) (footnote omitted)."
 384 ,7     ," The Court of Appeals also relied on Chief Judge Clark's suggestion in Nagler v. Admiral Corp., 248 F.2d 319 (CA2 1957), that
             facts indicating parallel conduct alone suffice to state a claim under § 1. 425 F.3d at 114 (citing Nagler, supra, at 325).  But
             Nagler gave no explanation for citing Theatre Enterprises (which upheld a denial of a directed verdict for plaintiff on the ground
             that proof of parallelism was not proof of conspiracy) as authority that pleading parallel conduct sufficed to plead a Sherman Act
             conspiracy.  Now that Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 104 S. Ct. 1464, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1984), and
             Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986), have made it
             clear that neither parallel conduct nor conscious parallelism, taken alone, raise the necessary implication of conspiracy, it is time
             for a fresh look at adequacy of pleading when a claim rests on parallel action. "
 385 ,8     ," Because Conley's ""'no set of facts'"" language was one of our earliest statements about pleading under the Federal Rules, it is
             no surprise that it has since been ""cited as authority"" by this Court and others.  Post, at 577, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 953.  Although we

             this issue in a case where the matter was not raised by the parties, see post, at 579, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 955, since both the ILECs
             and the Government highlight the problems stemming from a literal interpretation of Conley's ""no set of facts"" language and seek

             Respondents 17 (describing ""[p]etitioners and their amici"" as mounting an ""attack on Conley's 'no set of facts' standard"") The dissent finds relevance in Court of Appeals precedents from the 1940s, which allegedly gave rise to Conley's ""no set of
             facts"" language. See post, at 580-583, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 955-957.  Even indulging this line of analysis, these cases do not
             challenge the understanding that, before proceeding to discovery, a complaint must allege facts suggestive of illegal conduct.
             See, e.g., Leimer v. State Mut. Life Assurance Co. of Worcester, Mass., 108 F.2d 302, 305 (CA8 1940) (""'[I]f, in view of what is
             alleged, it can reasonably be conceived that the plaintiffs . . . could, upon a trial, establish a case which would entitle them to . . .

             1942) (""No matter how likely it may seem that the pleader will be unable to prove his case, he is entitled, upon averring a claim,
             to an opportunity to try to prove it"").  Rather, these cases stand for the unobjectionable proposition that, HN11[
             ] LEdHN[11][ ] [11] when a complaint adequately states a claim, it may not be dismissed based on a district court's assessment that the
             plaintiff will fail to find evidentiary support for his allegations or prove his claim to the satisfaction of the factfinder.  Cf. Scheuer v.
             Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S. Ct. 1683, 40 L. Ed. 2d 90 (1974) (a district court weighing a motion to dismiss asks ""not
             whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims"")."
 385 ,9     ," See Complaint PP 51, 64, App. 27, 30-31 (alleging that ILECs engaged in a ""contract, combination or conspiracy"" and agreed
             not to compete with one another). "
 386 ,10    ," If the complaint had not explained that the claim of agreement rested on the parallel conduct described, we doubt that the
             complaint's references to an agreement among the ILECs would have given the notice required by Rule 8.  Apart from identifying
             a 7-year span in which the § 1 violations were supposed to have occurred (i.e., ""[b]eginning at least as early as February 6,
             1996, and continuing to the present,"" id., P 64, App. 30), the pleadings mentioned no specific time, place, or person involved in
             the alleged conspiracies.  This lack of notice contrasts sharply with the model form for pleading negligence, Form 9, which the
             dissent says exemplifies the kind of ""bare allegation"" that survives a motion to dismiss.  Post, at 576, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 953.
             Whereas the model form alleges that the defendant struck the plaintiff with his car while plaintiff was crossing a particular
             highway at a specified date and time, the complaint here furnishes no clue as to which of the four ILECs (much less which of
             their employees) supposedly agreed, or when and where the illicit agreement took place.  A defendant wishing to prepare an
             answer in the simple fact pattern laid out in Form 9 would know what to answer; a defendant seeking to respond to plaintiffs'
             conclusory allegations in the § 1 context would have little idea where to begin."
 386 ,11    ," The dissent's quotations from the complaint leave the impression that plaintiffs directly allege illegal agreement; in fact, they
             proceed exclusively via allegations of parallel conduct, as both the District Court and Court of Appeals recognized.  See 313 F.
             Supp. 2d 174, 182 (SDNY 2003); 425 F.3d 99, 102-104 (CA2 2005)."
 386 ,12    ," From the allegation that the ILECs belong to various trade associations, see Complaint P 46, App. 23, the dissent playfully
             suggests that they conspired to restrain trade, an inference said to be ""buttressed by the common sense of Adam Smith.""  Post,
             at 591, 594, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 962, 963-964.  If Adam Smith is peering down today, he may be surprised to learn that his tongue-
             in-cheek remark would be authority to force his famous pinmaker to devote financial and human capital to hire lawyers, prepare
             for depositions, and otherwise fend off allegations of conspiracy; all this just because he belonged to the same trade guild as
             one of his competitors when their pins carried the same price tag. "
 387 ,13    ," The complaint quoted a reported statement of Qwest's CEO, Richard Notebaert, to suggest that the ILECs declined to
             compete against each other despite recognizing that it ""'might be a good way to turn a quick dollar.'""  P 42, App. 22 (quoting
             Chicago Tribune, Oct. 31, 2002, Business Section, p 1).  This was only part of what he reportedly said, however, and the District
             Court was entitled to take notice of the full contents of the published articles referenced in the complaint, from which the
             truncated quotations were drawn.  See Fed. Rule Evid. 201. Notebaert was also quoted as saying that entering new markets as
             a CLEC would not be ""a sustainable economic model"" because the CLEC pricing model is ""just . . . nuts.""  Chicago Tribune, Oct.
             31, 2002, Business Section, p 1 (cited at Complaint P 42, App. 22).  Another source cited in the complaint quotes Notebaert as
             saying he thought it ""unwise"" to ""base a business plan"" on the privileges accorded to CLECs under the 1996 Act because the
             regulatory environment was too unstable.  Chicago Tribune, Dec. 19, 2002, Business Section, p 2 (cited at Complaint P 45, App.

 392 ,6     ," The majority is correct to say that what the Federal Rules require is a ""'showing'"" of entitlement to relief.  Ante, at 555, n 3, 167
             L. Ed. 2d, at 940.  Whether and to what extent that ""showing"" requires allegations of fact will depend on the particulars of the
             claim.  For example, had the amended complaint in this case alleged only parallel conduct, it would not have made the required
             ""showing.""  See supra, at 570-571, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 949.  Similarly, had the pleadings contained only an allegation of
             agreement, without specifying the nature or object of that agreement, they would have been susceptible to the charge that they "
 393 ,      ," did not provide sufficient notice that the defendants may answer intelligently.  Omissions of that sort instance the type of
             ""bareness"" with which the Federal Rules are concerned.  A plaintiff's inability to persuade a district court that the allegations
             actually included in her complaint are ""plausible"" is an altogether different kind of failing, and one that should not be fatal at the
             pleading stage. "
 395 ,7     ," See also 5 Wright & Miller § 1202, at 89-90 (""[P]leadings under the rules simply may be a general summary of the party's
             position that is sufficient to advise the other party of the event being sued upon, to provide some guidance in a subsequent
             proceeding as to what was decided for purposes of res judicata and collateral estoppel, and to indicate whether the case should
             be tried to the court or to a jury.  No more is demanded of the pleadings than this; indeed, history shows that no more can be
             performed successfully by the pleadings"" (footnotes omitted)). "
 396 ,8     ," Our decision in Dura Pharms., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 125 S. Ct. 1627, 161 L. Ed. 2d 577 (2005), is not to the contrary.
             There, the plaintiffs failed adequately to allege loss causation, a required element in a private securities fraud action.  Because it
             alleged nothing more than that the prices of the securities the plaintiffs purchased were artificially inflated, the Dura complaint
             failed to ""provid[e] the defendants with notice of what the relevant economic loss might be or of what the causal connection
             might be between that loss and the [alleged] misrepresentation.""  Id., at 347, 125 S. Ct. 1627, 161 L. Ed. 2d 577.  Here, the
             failure the majority identifies is not a failure of notice--which ""notice pleading"" rightly condemns--but rather a failure to satisfy the
             Court that the agreement alleged might plausibly have occurred.  That being a question not of notice but of proof, it should not
             be answered without first hearing from the defendants (as apart from their lawyers). Similarly, in Associated Gen. Contractors of
             Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983), in which we also found an antitrust complaint
             wanting, the problem was not that the injuries the plaintiffs alleged failed to satisfy some threshold of plausibility, but rather that
             the injuries as alleged were not ""the type that the antitrust statute was intended to forestall.""  Id., at 540, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L.
             Ed. 2d 723; see id., at 526, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (""As the case comes to us, we must assume that the Union can
             prove the facts alleged in its amended complaint.  It is not, however, proper to assume that the Union can prove facts that it has
             not alleged or that the defendants have violated the antitrust laws in ways that have not been alleged""). "
 397 ,9     ," The Court suggests that the allegation of an agreement, even if credited, might not give the notice required by Rule 8 because
             it lacks specificity.  Ante, at 565, n 10, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 946.  The remedy for an allegation lacking sufficient specificity to provide
             adequate notice is, of course, a Rule 12(e) motion for a more definite statement.  See Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N. A., 534 U.S.
             506, 514, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002).  Petitioners made no such motion and indeed have conceded that ""[o]ur
             problem with the current complaint is not a lack of specificity, it's quite specific.""  Tr. of Oral Arg. 14.  Thus, the fact that ""the
             pleadings mentioned no specific time, place, or persons involved in the alleged conspiracies,"" ante, at 565, n 10, 167 L. Ed. 2d,
             at 946, is, for our purposes, academic."
 397 ,10    ," The Court describes my reference to the allegation that the defendants belong to various trade associations as ""playfully""
             suggesting that the defendants conspired to restrain trade.  Ante, at 567, n 12, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 947.  Quite the contrary:  An
             allegation that competitors meet on a regular basis, like the allegations of parallel conduct, is consistent with--though not
             sufficient to prove--the plaintiffs' entirely serious and unequivocal allegation that the defendants entered into an unlawful
             agreement.  Indeed, if it were true that the plaintiffs ""rest their § 1 claim on descriptions of parallel conduct and not on any
             independent allegation of actual agreement among the ILECs,"" ante, at 564, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 946, there would have been no
             purpose in including a reference to the trade association meetings in the amended complaint. "
 398 ,11    ," It is ironic that the Court seeks to justify its decision to draw factual inferences in the defendants' favor at the pleading stage by
             citing to a rule of evidence, ante, at 568, n 13, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 948.  Under Federal Rule of Evidence 201(b), a judicially noticed
             fact ""must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the
             trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be
             questioned.""  Whether Notebaert's statements constitute evidence of a conspiracy is hardly beyond reasonable dispute."
 398 ,12    ," The Court worries that a defendant seeking to respond to this ""conclusory"" allegation ""would have little idea where to begin.""
             Ante, at 565, n 10, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 946.  A defendant could, of course, begin by either denying or admitting the charge."
 398 ,13    ," The potential for ""sprawling, costly, and hugely time-consuming"" discovery, ante, at 560, n 6, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 943, is no
             reason to throw the baby out with the bathwater.  The Court vastly underestimates a district court's case-management arsenal.
             Before discovery even begins, the court may grant a defendant's Rule 12(e) motion; Rule 7(a) permits a trial court to order a
             plaintiff to reply to a defendant's answer, see Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 598, 118 S. Ct. 1584, 140 L. Ed. 2d 759
             (1998); and Rule 23 requires ""rigorous analysis"" to ensure that class certification is appropriate, General Telephone Co. of
             Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161, 102 S. Ct. 2364, 72 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1982); see In re Initial Public Offering Securities
             Litigation, 471 F.3d 24 (CA2 2006) (holding that a district court may not certify a class without ruling that each Rule 23
             requirement is met, even if a requirement overlaps with a merits issue).  Rule 16 invests a trial judge with the power, backed by
             sanctions, to regulate pretrial proceedings via conferences and scheduling orders, at which the parties may discuss, inter alia,
             ""the elimination of frivolous claims or defenses,"" Rule 16(c)(1); ""the necessity or desirability of amendments to the pleadings,""
             Rule 16(c)(2); ""the control and scheduling of discovery,"" Rule 16(c)(6); and ""the need for adopting special procedures for
             managing potentially difficult or protracted actions that may involve complex issues, multiple parties, difficult legal questions, or
             unusual proof problems,"" Rule 16(c)(12).  Subsequently, Rule 26 confers broad discretion to control the combination of
             interrogatories, requests for admissions, production requests, and depositions permitted in a given case; the sequence in which
             such discovery devices may be deployed; and the limitations imposed upon them.  See 523 U.S., at 598-599, 118 S. Ct. 1584,
             140 L. Ed. 2d 759.  Indeed, Rule 26(c) specifically permits a court to take actions ""to protect a party or person from annoyance,
             embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense"" by, for example, disallowing a particular discovery request, setting
             appropriate terms and conditions, or limiting its scope. In short, the Federal Rules contemplate that pretrial matters will be settled
             through a flexible process of give and take, of proffers, stipulations, and stonewalls, not by having trial judges screen allegations "
 399 ,      ," for their plausibility vel non without requiring an answer from the defendant.  See Societe Internationale pour Participations
             Industrielles et Commerciales, S. A. v. Rogers, 357 U.S. 197, 206, 78 S. Ct. 1087, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1255 (1958) (""Rule 34 is
             sufficiently flexible to be adapted to the exigencies of particular litigation"").  And should it become apparent over the course of
             litigation that a plaintiff's filings bespeak an in terrorem suit, the district court has at its call its own in terrorem device, in the form
             of a wide array of Rule 11 sanctions.  See Rules 11(b), (c) (authorizing sanctions if a suit is presented ""for any improper
             purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation""); see Business Guides,
             Inc. v. Chromatic Communications Enterprises, Inc., 498 U.S. 533, 111 S. Ct. 922, 112 L. Ed. 2d 1140 (1991) (holding that Rule
             11 applies to a represented party who signs a pleading, motion, or other papers, as well as to attorneys); Atkins v. Fischer, 232
             F.R.D. 116, 126 (DC 2005) (""As possible sanctions pursuant to Rule 11, the court has an arsenal of options at its disposal"")."
 399 ,14    ," Given his ""background in antitrust law,"" ante, at 560, n 6, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 943, Judge Easterbrook has recognized that the
             most effective solution to discovery abuse lies in the legislative and rulemaking arenas.  He has suggested that the remedy for
             the ills he complains of requires a revolution in the rules of civil procedure: ""Perhaps a system in which judges pare away issues and focus on investigation is too radical to contemplate in this
             country--although it prevailed here before 1938, when the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were adopted.  The change
             could not be accomplished without abandoning notice pleading, increasing the number of judicial officers, and giving them
             more authority . . . .  If we are to rule out judge-directed discovery, however, we must be prepared to pay the piper.  Part of
             the price is the high cost of unnecessary discovery--impositional and otherwise.""  Discovery as Abuse, 69 B. U. L. Rev. 635,
             645 (1989). "
 400 ,15    ," It would be quite wrong, of course, to assume that dismissal of an antitrust case after discovery is costless to plaintiffs.  See
             Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 54(d)(1) (""[C]osts other than attorneys' fees shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the
             court otherwise directs""). "
 418 ,1     ," The Court suggests that the argument advanced in my opinion was not preserved by respondents.  See ante, at 275, 168 L.
             Ed. 2d, at 155.  Respondents' principal contention in the Court of Appeals below was that ""[t]he federal securities laws do not
             expressly immunize Defendants' alleged conduct from prosecution under the federal antitrust laws.""  See, e.g., Brief for
             Appellants in No. 03-9288 (CA2), pp 15-16.  Because a full reading of the securities laws is essential to analyzing respondents'
             central argument, I do not consider arguments based on the saving clauses unpreserved.  Cf. United States v. Morton, 467 U.S.
             822, 828, 104 S. Ct. 2769, 81 L. Ed. 2d 680 (1984) (""[W]e read statutes as a whole""). "
 419 ,2     ," The Court's suggestion that the clauses were intended to save only securities-related rights and remedies is subject to many of
             the same criticisms.  See ante, at 275, 168 L. Ed. 2d, at 155-156.  The Securities Act of 1933 provided no private federal remedy
             for fraud in the purchase or sale of registered securities.  On the Court's proposed reading of § 77p, however, a federal action for
             mail or wire fraud and a state-law action for fraud, which are not securities-related rights or remedies, would not have been
             included within the Securities Act's saving provision. "
 463 ,1     ," Petitioners consist of several corporate entities and subsidiaries, and their names and corporate structures have changed
             frequently over the course of this litigation.  For simplicity, we will refer to all the petitioners as ""AT&T."" "
 466 ,2     ," The Court of Appeals assumed that any duty to deal arose only from FCC regulations, 503 F.3d 876, 878-879, n 6(CA9 2007),
             and the question on which we granted certiorari made the same assumption.  Even aside from the District Court's reasoning,

             (Alcoa).  In that case, the Government alleged that Alcoa was using its monopoly power in the upstream aluminum ingot market
             to squeeze the profits of downstream aluminum sheet fabricators.  The court concluded:  ""That it was unlawful to set the price of
             'sheet' so low and hold the price of ingot so high, seems to us unquestionable, provided, as we have held, that on this record the
             price of ingot must  [****26] be regarded as higher than a 'fair price.'""  Id., at 438.  Given developments in economic theory and

             coordinated team trademark sales are necessary to produce “NFL football,” a single NFL brand that competes against other
             forms of entertainment. But defining the product as “NFL football” puts the cart before the horse: Of course the NFL produces
             NFL football; but that does not mean that cooperation amongst NFL teams is immune from § 1 scrutiny. Members of any cartel

             Brulotte was decided, those agreements counted as per se antitrust violations and patent misuse; now, they are unlawful only if
             the patent holder wields power in the relevant market. See Act of Nov. 19, 1988, §201, 102 Stat. 4676 (adding the

             to adopt the same standard). But it is far from clear that the old rule of tying was among Brulotte’s legal underpinnings. Brulotte
             briefly analogized post-expiration royalty agreements to tying arrangements, but only after relating the statutory and caselaw
             basis for its holding and “conclud[ing]” that post-patent royalties are “unlawful per se.” 379 U.S., at 32, 85 S. Ct. 176, 13 L. Ed.
             2d 99. And even if that analogy played some real role in Brulotte, the development of tying law would not undercut the
             decision—rather the opposite. Congress took the lead in changing the treatment of tying agreements and, in doing so,
             conspicuously left Brulotte in place. Indeed, Congress declined to enact bills that would have modified not only tying doctrine but
             also Brulotte. See supra, at ___, 192 L. Ed. 2d, at 472 (citing S. 1200, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. (1987), and S. 438, 100th Cong.,

             statute there at issue, the Alien Tort Statute, 28 U.S.C. §1350, is a spare jurisdictional grant that itself does not “regulate conduct
             or afford relief.” Kiobel, 569 U.S., at 116, 133 S. Ct. 1659, 185 L. Ed. 2d 671, 680. With no grounding for extraterritorial
             application in the statute, Kiobel held, courts have no warrant to fashion, on their own initiative, claims for relief that operate
             extraterritorially. See ibid. (“[T]he question is not what Congress has done but instead what [****56]  courts may do.”)."
 697 ,3     ," The Court asserts that “[t]here is good reason not to interpret §1964(c) to cover foreign injuries just because the Clayton Act
             does.” Ante, at 25, 195 L. Ed. 2d, at 502. The Clayton Act’s definition of “person,” 15 U.S.C. §12, the Court observes, “explicitly
             includes ‘corporations and associations existing under or authorized by . . . the laws of any foreign country.’” Ante, at 25, 195 L.
             Ed. 2d, at 502 (some internal quotation marks omitted). RICO, the Court stresses, lacks this “critical” language. Ibid. The Court’s
             point is underwhelming. RICO’s definition of “persons” is hardly confining: “any individual or entity capable of holding a legal or
             beneficial interest in property.” 18 U.S.C. §1961(3). Moreover, there is little doubt that Congress anticipated §1964(c) plaintiffs
             like the suitors here. See 147 Cong. Rec. 20676, 20710 (2001) (remarks of Sen. Kerry) (“Since some of the money-laundering
             conducted in the world today also defrauds foreign governments, it would be hostile to the intent [****59]  of [the USA PATRIOT
             Act, which added as RICO predicates additional money laundering offenses,] for us to interject into the statute any rule of
             construction of legislative language which would in any way limit our foreign allies access to our courts to battle against money

             the Chamber to regulate exports under the Ministry’s authority and direction. Ibid. In 1997, the Ministry authorized the establishment of the Chamber’s Vitamin C Subcommittee. Id., at 202a. That year, the
             Ministry promulgated a regulation authorizing and requiring the subcommittee to limit the production of vitamin C for export and
             to set export prices. Id., at 202a-204a. Under the regulation delineating this “Export Licensing System,” the Ministry issued
             export licenses only to manufacturers whose export volume and price complied with the output quota and price coordinated by
             the Vitamin C Subcommittee. Id., at 204a. In 2002, the Ministry replaced the Export Licensing System with a “Verification and Chop System.” Id., at 208a. As set forth in a
             2002 Ministry Notice, the Chamber itself—instead of the Ministry—would inspect each export contract and certify its compliance
             with the coordinated quotas and price by affixing a special seal, known as a “chop.” Id., at 208a-209a. China’s Customs would
             allow export only if the exporter presented its contract bearing the Chamber’s “chop.” Id., at 209a. According to the Ministry, it "
 707 ,      ," was implicit in this arrangement that vitamin C exporters would remain under an obligation to fix prices and volumes. Id., at
             208a. The effect of China’s regime on the Chinese sellers’ liability under the Sherman Act, we note, is not an issue before the Court
             today."

             Beyond that, the Vitamin C Subcommittee had replaced its 1997 Charter with a new 2002 Charter, App. 182-197, which
             eliminated the 1997 Charter’s requirement that subcommittee members “[s]trictly execute” the “coordinated price” set by the
             Chamber, compare id., at 85, with id., at 185, and granted members an express “[r]igh[t]” to “freely resign from the

 727 ,7     ," The plaintiffs argue that we need not define the relevant market in this case because they have offered actual evidence of

             S. 643, 100 S. Ct. 1925, 64 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1980) (per curiam)). We disagree. The cases that the plaintiffs cite for this proposition
             evaluated whether horizontal restraints had an adverse effect on competition. See Indiana Federation of Dentists, supra, at 450-
             451, 459, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 (agreement between competing dentists not to share X rays with insurance

             to compete on extending credit to retailers). Given that horizontal restraints involve agreements between competitors not to
             compete in some way, this Court concluded that it did not need to precisely define the relevant market to conclude that these
             agreements were anticompetitive. See Indiana Federation of Dentists, supra, at 460-461, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445;
             Catalano, supra, at 648-649, 100 S. Ct. 1925, 64 L. Ed. 2d 580. But vertical restraints are different. See Arizona v. Maricopa
             County Medical Soc., 457 U. S. 332, 348, n. 18, 102 S. Ct. 2466, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48 (1982); Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc.

             pose no risk to competition unless the entity imposing them has market power, which cannot be evaluated unless the Court first
             defines the relevant market. See id., at 898, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 (noting that a vertical restraint “may not be a
             serious concern unless the relevant entity has market power”); Easterbrook, Vertical Arrangements and the Rule of Reason, 53

             cardholder services are both inputs to this single product. See ibid."
 728 ,9     ," Nontransaction platforms, by contrast, often do compete with companies that do not operate on both sides of their platform. A
             newspaper that sells advertising, for example, might have to compete with a television network, even though the two do not
             meaningfully compete for viewers. See Filistrucchi 301. "
 731 ,10    ," The plaintiffs argue that United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U. S. 596, 610, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972),
             forbids any restraint that would restrict competition in part of the market—here, for example, merchant steering. See Brief for
             Petitioners and Respondents Nebraska, Tennessee, and Texas 30, 42. Topco does not stand for such a broad proposition.
             Topco concluded that a horizontal agreement between competitors was unreasonable per se, even though the agreement did
             not extend to every competitor in the market. See 405 U. S., at 599, 608, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515. A horizontal
             agreement between competitors is markedly different from a vertical agreement that incidentally affects one particular method of
             competition. See Leegin, 551 U. S., at 888, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623; Maricopa County Medical Soc., 457 U. S., at

             cent rule in their complaint in district court or in their briefs to the court of appeals. And, as I’ve noted, they concede that they are

             commission on each sale. So even assuming for argument’s sake that the 30% commission was entirely illegal, Apple can only
             be required to pay out in damages, at most, the full amount it received in commissions. To their credit, even plaintiffs have
             conceded as much, acknowledging that because “there is only one 30% markup,” any claim by the developers against Apple
             would necessarily be seeking “a piece of the same 30% pie.” Brief in Opposition 12. It’s a mystery why the Court refuses to
