32,2," Order of Nov. 25, 1970, #70 Civ. 4128, S.D.N.Y.  In addition to enjoining the strike, the decree contained the following 
language, restraining the ""core"" defendants and all persons in active concert or participation with them . . . (D) from engaging in conduct, directly or indirectly, which would prevent plaintiff from carrying on its business, including the 
purchase by and delivery to plaintiff of food products and equipment, the sale of its food products, the hiring of personnel 
and the servicing of equipment; (E) from threatening or otherwise interfering with, directly or indirectly, manufacturers, "
33,," vendors, suppliers, service concerns and customers of plaintiff, and any one else who does or seeks to do business with 
plaintiff . . ."

33,6," Unreported opinion, #70 Civ. 4128 S.D.N.Y., Dec. 26, 1972 (Carter, J.)"
33,7," Some progress has been made.  See, e.g., Unreported Memorandum and appended Order with Respect to Lead and Liaison 
Counsel, and Memorandum of Understanding with Respect to Lead Counsel, #70 Civ. 4128, S.D. N.Y., Oct. 24, 1973."
33,8," The letter stated, among other things, that . . . certain defendants and a number of non-defendant suppliers have apparently engaged in a course of conduct which can 
only be interpreted as deliberate interference with plaintiff's business.  We have been advised that these actions have been 
taken because of ""pressures"" in the industry not to service Harlem Co-op. This course of conduct has increased 
dramatically in the last month during the course of Court ordered depositions. . . .  We are constrained to advise you that 
our client will not sit idly by and tolerate interruptions and interferences with its business."
33,9," After trial counsel was discharged, defendant Local 338 moved to disqualify plaintiff's Coordinator-Legal Counsel from actively 
representing the Co-op in this litigation, asserting that Ms. Walker, as the ""guiding spirit"" of the Co-op would or should be a key 
plaintiff's witness at trial.  This Court denied the motion, giving plaintiff, instead, the option of continuing with Ms. Walker as its 
sole counsel, with restrictions on her trial testimony; or retaining new trial counsel, in which event her testimony would be subject 
only to the restrictions imposed on any other witness before the jury.  Unreported opinion, #70 Civ. 4128, S.D.N.Y., Oct. 29, 
1973. "
34,10," Rosenblum and Solomon were convicted along with three other ""core"" defendants for violations of 29 U.S.C. § 186 growing 
out of the dispute, among other things, with the plaintiff.  Although their own convictions were not appealed, the Second Circuit 
affirmed the convictions of their co-defendants.  United States v. Overton, et al., 470 F.2d 761 (2d Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 411 
U.S. 909, 93 S. Ct. 1528, 36 L. Ed. 2d 200 (1973). Solomon and Kaufman are presently involved in bankruptcy proceedings in 
this court."
34,11," It cannot be said that counsel for plaintiff was unaware of these options.  The letter of May 25, 1973, note 8, supra, warned 
defendants that . . . We have advised Harlem River of the available remedies including, inter alia, contempt proceedings, the extension of the 
injunction, the amendment of the complaint so as to include additional defendants and to recover additional damages 
sustained as a result of the apparently continuing and expanding conspiracy to drive Harlem River out of business."
34,12," There was a serious question raised as to whether or not the allegations in the complaint were sufficient to support this motion 
charging somewhat different violations of the antitrust law, occurring long after the complaint was filed.  This Court determined 
that the complaint was sufficient against all the defendants named in the proceeding ""in this age of 'notice ' pleading,"" particularly 
when the new violations were said to be part of the continuing conspiracy. Checker Motors Corp. v. Chrysler Corp., 283 F. Supp. 
876, 881 (S.D.N.Y. 1968), aff'd, 405 F.2d 319 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 999, 22 L. Ed. 2d 777, 89 S. Ct. 1595 (1969). "
35,13," Zenith Corp. v. Hazeltine, 395 U.S. 100, 130-31, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129, 89 S. Ct. 1562 (1969)."
35,14," Thus, this Court's Order of Oct. 31, 1973, stating that the hearing would proceed, set forth the following: While serious questions have been raised as to whether plaintiff has the proper parties before the Court in order to proceed 
on its theory with respect to the impact of non-defendants in this action, it will be given the opportunity to present evidence 
on the question of whether or not the relationship among the defendants . . . and between these defendants and non-
defendants is such that an expansion of the existing injunctive order is required both as to relief and as to defendants 
enjoined . . . The Court's focus, during these hearings, will be on whether or not there is, in fact, a change from the status 
quo achieved by the injunctive order of November 17, 1970, and if so, whether or not the proof indicates, consistent with 
the standards for preliminary relief, that any of the defendants named are responsible for the change in contravention of the 
antitrust laws."
35,15," It is important to note that Met Food Corp. had full notice of the pleading in this proceeding, and that its representatives were 
frequently in court during the hearing, and that its documents form the basis for some of plaintiff's proof and much of the 
defendants' opposition to the motion.  The fact that Met Food was not named as a party in the action does not, of course, 
prevent the showing of its complicity in the alleged conspiracy. See, e.g., Eagle Lion Films, Inc. v. Loew's Inc., 219 F.2d 196, 
199 (2d Cir. 1955)."
35,16," Pursuant to this Court's general equity powers and by the authority of Section 5 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 16. "
36,17," See, United States v. United Shoe Corp., 391 U.S. 244, 20 L. Ed. 2d 562, 88 S. Ct. 1496 (1968). Cf.  King-Seeley Thermos 
Co. v. Aladdin Industries, Inc., 418 F.2d 31 (2d Cir. 1969)."
36,18," In this event the Court could have exercised its general equity powers ""akin to an exercise of [its] contempt power for the 
purpose of protecting the integrity of the judicial system."" House of Materials, Inc. v. Simplicity Pattern Co., 298 F.2d 867, 871 
(2d Cir. 1962). See, Bergen Drug Co., Inc. v. Parke, Davis & Co., 307 F.2d 725 (3d Cir. 1962)."
36,19," This line of cases deals, generally, with contempt situations.  It would be applicable here only if the Court issued a new or 
modified injunction and plaintiff could show in a later contempt proceeding that Met Food had received actual notice of that order 
by personal service or otherwise, and was acting in concert with the freshly enjoined defendants in violation of the order.  Fed. 
R. Civ. P. 65(d). "
37,20," The ""critical"" category had its genesis in the list of 49 items which plaintiff claimed were ""scratched"" in the delivery of Oct. 16, 
1973, but were available in competing Met-serviced stores.  The parties agreed that at least 43 of these items were national 
brand products and therefore, ""critical."" The Court has concluded from a comparative study of the documents related to that 
order that 30 of the 43 items were actually ordered by the Co-op and ""scratched"" by Met.  Plaintiff's figure is higher because its 
list appears to have erroneously included some items in sizes that were actually delivered, but has failed to include the same 
items in sizes that were ordered and not delivered.  In any event, the 30 items ""scratched"" are sufficient to prove plaintiff's point. "
38,21," Although it is not necessary to decide here, it should be noted that cross-examination of some of plaintiff's operating personnel 
indicated that they could have taken measures which might have alleviated the impact of the short supplies of some items. To 
that extent, the ""scratches"" cannot be said to be the sole reason for the drop in plaintiff's revenues during the relevant period."
38,22," Plaintiff's effort to do so, with the comparative shopping trip of Oct. 20, 1973, described in the Glenn Affidavit of Oct. 24, 1973, 
was minimized when it developed during the hearing that one of the two stores shopped was not, at that time, a Met customer, 
and the other was outside the ""Harlem target area."" Furthermore, Met's delivery documents with respect to the latter indicate that 
18% of the cases it ordered on Oct. 16, 1973, were ""scratched"" by Met."
38,23," These competitor-customers of Met Food are an entirely different group of individual stores, unrelated to any defendant 
""competitor"" in this action, or to each other.  No competitor-customer is a party to this action; and no defendant ""competitor"" in 
this action is presently serviced by Met Food. "
39,24," These week to week variations tend to even out over the period, as demonstrated by the ""scratch"" percentages of the week of 
Sept. 10, 1973: The Co-op, 17%; Cherrie, 15%; Food City, 21%; Food Pageant, 26% and 16%; Sureway, 16%; Teitler, 15%."
39,25," Plaintiff's allegations with respect to the late delivery over the Columbus Day holiday were never supported sufficiently to lead 
this Court to believe that the incident was any more than an inadvertent misunderstanding for which the plaintiff and Met Food 
share equal responsibility.  In any event, there is authority for the proposition that with respect to at least some forms of 
discrimination, plaintiff is required to show that there was a pattern, not just an isolated event.  See, e.g., International Film 
Center, Inc. v. Graflex, Inc., 427 F.2d 334 (2d Cir. 1970). "
40,26," Of some interest is a recent report citing these same economic and meteorological occurrences during 1973 for the current 
rising price of rice.  See, N.Y. Times, Feb. 4, 1973, § 1, at 25, Col. 1. "
41,27," Plaintiff's moving papers appeared to assert some of these factual conclusions as separate objectives of the conspiracy and 
as separate bases for relief.  For instance, plaintiff's early allegation against the national brand manufacturers, none of which are 
defendants in this action, sounded as if the plaintiff was attempting to assert an illegal boycott in violation of the Sherman Act.  
Plaintiff did call a manager of General Foods to the stand, but the testimony elicited did not advance plaintiff's theory, and its 
other efforts along these lines were so incomplete and vague that it must be deemed to have abandoned the theory.  The same 
conclusion must be drawn with respect to the other allegations set forth as possible separate violations of the antitrust laws. 
However, the proof that was adduced with respect to these allegations, if any, has been carefully weighed in the conspiracy 
equation."
41,28," Most of these items have been offered in the form of transcripts from prior depositions by plaintiff of defendants' officers.  
Defendants have objected to the admission of much of this material and many of their objections are valid.  However, this Court 
has taken much of the evidence in this proceeding subject to connection.  It has admitted all of the depositions offered by plaintiff 
subject to the same qualification. Since this Court has found no conspiracy, there has been no connection.  No evidentiary ruling from this hearing shall have any 
force or effect against the defendants in any future proceeding in this action. "

67,1," Consolidated pretrial proceedings in these cases were conducted pursuant to order of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict 
Litigation under 28 U.S.C. § 1407. By pretrial order dated March 20, 1972, they were consolidated for trial."
67,2," The proceedings were reported in over 10,000 pages of reporter's transcript and nearly 1700 exhibits were received in 
evidence."
67,3," Since distinctions among these entities are not relevant to any of the issues herein, each of these entities will be referred to as 
""Koratron"" throughout this opinion."
67,4, Civil Action No. 50063.
67,5," Since the commencement of this action, its name was changed to Dan River, Inc."
67,6," Order of Honorable William E. Doyle, dated October 8, 1971, based on his Memorandum of April 30, 1971, appearing in 329 F. 
Supp. 211 (N.D. Cal. 1971). "
69,7," In addition to these efforts, there have been substantial improvements made in the mechanical means by which the desired 
appearance can be obtained, e.g., the development and improvement of home and professional presses.  See, e.g., Solinger, 
Apparel Manufacturing Analysis (N.Y., Textile Book Publishers, Inc., 1961)."
69,8," There was some evidence that even thermosetting compounds may be remolded after setting upon application of a sufficiently 
high degree of heat.  However, this fact, even if true, is not material to any of the issues in this trial."
69,9," By contrast, thermoplastic molecules, upon being heated, form only long chains (which impart plasticity to thermoplastic 
compounds) but do not, upon further application of heat, cross-link to form branches either with themselves or with cellulose 
molecules, as do thermosetting molecules.  Chemically speaking, it is this formation of intricate, cross-linked structures which 
distinguishes thermosetting from thermoplastic compounds and which rigidifies and renders thermosetting compounds relatively 
unaffected by subsequent applications of heat."
69,10," The terms polymerization, cure, set, and cross-linking are for purposes of this opinion synonymous.  The terms polymerizable 
and unpolymerized are also synonymous.  See Reporter's Transcript (hereafter R.T.), pp. 1953-61, 3274. "
70,11," As used by the Court throughout this opinion, "" post cure"" requires impregnation of the fabric in the bolt or running form and 
cure or polymerization of the resin at the completed garment stage.  As thus defined, ""post-cure"" does not include a process, 
such as that practiced by the Williamson-Dickey Co., in which both impregnation and cure occurred after completion of garment 
manufacture."
70,12," Dan River claims, and the Court finds, that the Dan Press fabric falls within this ""partial cure"" category. "
72,13," Any invention must be construed in light of its prosecution history as revealed in the file wrapper.  Graham v. John Deere Co.,

72,14," Claims as allowed must be read with reference to rejected claims.  Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 33, 15 L. Ed. 2d 
545, 86 S. Ct. 684 (1966); Schriber Co. v. Cleveland Trust Co., 311 U.S. 211, 220-221, 85 L. Ed. 132, 61 S. Ct. 235 (1940)."
72,15," Since the applicants' argument above was made to overcome a rejection based on prior art, file wrapper estoppel applies as to 
this issue against Koratron.  Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 33, 15 L. Ed. 2d 545, 86 S. Ct. 684 (1966)."
72,16," Unless noted to the contrary, emphasis is supplied throughout this opinion. "
74,17," Words such as ""approximately"" or ""substantially"" cannot be read out of a patent, but must be read together with more specific 
terms.  Borg-Warner Corporation v. Paragon Gear Works, Inc., 355 F.2d 400, 403-404 (1 Cir. 1965), cert. dismissed, 384 
U.S. 935, 86 S. Ct. 1461, 16 L. Ed. 2d 536 (1966)."
74,18," Patent applicants need disclose only the mode of practice conceived to be best for practicing the patent, not all conceivable 
modes.  The patent, however, ""is not confined to the precise mode outlined."" Chicago Pneumatic Tool Co. v. Hughes Tool Co., 
97 F.2d 945, 946 (10 Cir. 1938); cert. denied, 305 U.S. 643, 83 L. Ed. 415, 59 S. Ct. 146 (1938), rehearing denied, 305 U.S. 
673, 83 L. Ed. 436, 59 S. Ct. 242 (1938)."
74,19," Claim 1 of Brown specified a 6 to 15 per cent range for moisture content (Column 6, line 1). "
75,20," Although an inventor's own statements or admissions made subsequent to the issuance of the patent about pertinent facts 
underlying the patent cannot be used to broaden the scope of the patent, they may be some evidence of its scope if they tend to 
show the meaning he gave to words used in the application when filed.  Ellipse Corporation v. Ford Motor Company, 452 F.2d 
163, 169 (7 Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 948, 32 L. Ed. 2d 337, 92 S. Ct. 2041, rehearing denied, 409 U.S. 898, 34 L. Ed. 
2d 157, 93 S. Ct. 99 (1972). Further, the actions and statements against interest of the inventor or owner of a patent may 
properly be considered in construing the scope of the patent Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Products, 350 F.2d 18, 25 
(9 Cir. 1965). "
76,21," A patentee's appraisal of his own invention made during the prosecution of a corresponding foreign patent may be relevant to 
the issue of scope.  Sarazin v. Wright Aeronautical Corporation, 54 F. Supp. 244, 251 (S.D.N.Y. 1944), aff'd sub nom.  Clark v. 
Wright Aeronautical Corporation, 162 F.2d 960 (2 Cir. 1967); Intermountain Research Co., Inc. v. Hercules, Inc., 163 U.S.P.Q. 
390, 394 (C.D. Cal. 1969)."
76,22," At trial Koratron failed to present any evidence that prior to the filing of these cases it construed the '432 patent to teach that 
only ""sufficient"" uncured resins need be retained before baking the completed garment. It would appear that Koratron's position 
at trial as to the scope of the patent is more the product of able trial counsel than the teaching of the inventors.  Warnock, one of 
the co-inventors, in his deposition first testified that, in practicing the '432 process, the resins must be completely uncured but 
subsequently changed his testimony and stated that there need be only ""sufficient uncured resins"" in the fabric to make a 
satisfactory permanent-press garment. He conceded that he discussed this change in his deposition testimony with his lawyers. "
77,23," Technically speaking, DMDHEU does not polymerize like urea and melamine formaldehyde resins. The latter resins 
polymerize by reacting with each other and cross-linking with cellulose.  DMDHEU cross-linking, on the other hand, often occurs 
by reaction with the cellulose at two or more reactive sites on the DMDHEU molecule and not through another molecule of 
DMDHEU to which cellulose is attached.  That is, the urea and melamine formaldehyde monomers link up with cellulose 
molecules and with each other to form polymers, effectively bonding the cellulose fiber together in fixed shapes.  But DMDHEU 
does not form polymers.  Rather, each already complex DMDHEU molecule cross-links with several cellulose molecules and, 
upon curing, fixes them in a restorable shape. "
78,24," It must be emphasized that the '432 patented process does not include the manufacture or finishing (i.e. impregnation) of this 
fabric. The use by the garment maker of the specific fabric defined in this subheading (2) constitutes the first step in the practice 
of the patented process. Koratron has acknowledged that its patented process ""is practiced only when garments are made"" and 
not by a textile mill in treating or sensitizing fabric (Pretrial Order, p. 42). "
79,25," It has been consistently held in this Circuit that the question of the validity of a patent is one of fact.  Stauffer v. Slenderella 
Systems of California, 254 F.2d 127 (9 Cir. 1957), and the cases cited therein at p. 127 n. 1."
79,26," Traditionally the statutory conditions for patentability have been expressed in the three terms, "" 'novelty, utility and 
nonobviousness'"".  Reeves Instrument Corp. v. Beckman Instruments, Inc., 444 F.2d 263, 271 (9 Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 
951, 30 L. Ed. 2d 268, 92 S. Ct. 283 (1971); Jeddeloh Brothers Sweed Mills, Inc. v. Coe Manufacturing Co., 375 F.2d 85, 87 (9 
Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 823, 88 S. Ct. 57, 19 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1967). Novelty and utility are required by 35 U.S.C. § 101, and 
the standards for attaining novelty are set out in § 102. Obviousness is discussed in § 103. Adversaries do not challenge the utility of the '432 patent. Their attack focuses on novelty, which the Court discusses below 
under the headings of ""Anticipation- § 102(a)"" and ""Prior Public Use- § 102(b),"" and on obviousness, considered below under a 
separate heading for § 103. The Pretrial Order indicates that at one time Adversaries asserted a fifth statutory ground for 
invalidity, prior invention by others under 35 U.S.C. § 102(g).  The Court finds that because of the absence of argument and 
proposed findings as to this contention, Adversaries have abandoned it."
79,27," The following standards have been invoked: (1) The presumption can be overcome only by proof establishing invalidity beyond a reasonable doubt.  Deering v. Winona 
Harvester Works, 155 U.S. 286, 301, 39 L. Ed. 153, 15 S. Ct. 118 (1894); The Barbed Wire Patent, 143 U.S. 275, 285, 36 L. Ed. 
154, 12 S. Ct. 443 (1892); Cantrell v. Wallick, 117 U.S. 689, 695-696, 29 L. Ed. 1017, 6 S. Ct. 970 (1886); Bianchi v. Barili, 168 
F.2d 793, 795 (9 Cir. 1948). "
80,," Koratron has stressed this standard in its argument on § 102(b).  See Koratron's Memorandum on the Standard of Proof, filed 
May 26, 1972.  This standard has been specifically rejected in this Circuit for cases involving a claim on invalidity based on prior 
public use, § 102(b).  Tucker Aluminum Products, Inc. v. Grossman, 312 F.2d 293, 294 (9 Cir. 1963). See also Canadian 
Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Products of San Mateo, Inc., 223 F. Supp. 803, 815-816 (N.D. Cal. 1963), aff'd in part and rev'd 
in part, 350 F.2d 18, 21-22 (9 Cir. 1965). (2) Not only must ""reasonable doubts * * * be resolved in favor of validity,"" the evidence of invalidity must be ""clear and 
convincing."" Moon v. Cabot Shops, Inc., 270 F.2d 539, 541 (9 Cir. 1959), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 965, 4 L. Ed. 2d 546, 80 S. Ct. 
596 (1960); Patterson-Ballagh Corp. v. Moss, 201 F.2d 403, 406 (9 Cir. 1953). (3) The burden ""is not satisfied by a mere preponderance of the evidence, but is borne successfully only if the evidence is clear 
and satisfactory -- perhaps beyond a reasonable doubt."" Whiteman v. Mathews, 216 F.2d 712, 716 (9 Cir. 1954). (4) There must be "" 'substantial evidence ' which is 'clear and satisfactory '"" although the proof need not be beyond a reasonable 
doubt.  Tucker Aluminum Products, Inc. v. Grossman, supra, 312 F.2d at 294; Amerio Contact Plate Freezers, Inc. v. Belt-Ice 
Corporation, 316 F.2d 459, 462 n. 7 (9 Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 902, 84 S. Ct. 191, 11 L. Ed. 2d 143 (1963). (5) The proof must be ""clear and convincing,"" with no mention of reasonable doubt.  Purer & Company v. Aktiebolaget Addo, 410 
F.2d 871, 879 (9 Cir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 834, 24 L. Ed. 2d 84, 90 S. Ct. 90 (1969); Neff Instrument Corporation v. Cohu 
Electronics, Inc., 298 F.2d 82, 86 (9 Cir. 1961). (6) The party alleging invalidity ""bears a heavy burden of persuasion, and fails unless his evidence has more than a dubious 
preponderance."" Radio Corporation of America v. Radio Laboratories, Inc., 293 U.S. 1, 8, 79 L. Ed. 163, 54 S. Ct. 752 (1934)."
80,28," ""A patent shall be presumed valid.  The burden of establishing invalidity of a patent shall rest on a party asserting it."" 35 U.S.C. 
§ 282. "
81,29," The use of a preponderance standard was impliedly upheld in Ethicon, Inc. v. Handgards, Inc., 432 F.2d 438 (9 Cir. 1970), 
cert. denied, 402 U.S. 929, 28 L. Ed. 2d 863, 91 S. Ct. 1525, rehearing denied, 403 U.S. 912, 29 L. Ed. 2d 690, 91 S. Ct. 2204 
(1971). The appellate court observed that ""we have a case that could have been decided either way."" Despite this equilibrium in 
the evidence, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's holding that there had been a prior public use and that, therefore, the 
patent was invalid under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b)."
81,30," 35 U.S.C. § 102 provides in relevant part: ""A person shall be entitled to a patent unless -- (a) the invention was known or used by others in this country, or patented or 
described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country, before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent * * *."""
81,31, All of these references are set out in full in Adversaries' Exhibit A-925. 
82,32," Adversaries also contend that the Pleetset process and the activities of Ideal Pleating Co. both ""anticipated"" the '432 patent 
and constituted a prior public use under § 102(b).  However, since the Court finds, infra, that neither Pleetset nor the Ideal 
activities constituted prior public use of the '432 process under § 102(b), a fortiori, neither can be anticipatory under the stricter 
standards of identity required when applying § 102(a)."
82,33," Although both subsections (a) and (b) of § 102 relate patentability to the existence of prior patents or descriptions in printed 
publications and although the cited cases do not refer specifically to subsection (a) when they enunciate the test for 
""anticipation,"" it is clear that the ""technical"" defense of ""anticipation"" by prior patented or published references is based 
principally on § 102(a).  Frantz Manufacturing Co. v. Phenix Manufacturing Co., 457 F.2d 314, 318-319 (7 Cir. 1972); Illinois Tool 
Works, Inc. v. Sweetheart Plastics, Inc., 436 F.2d 1180, 1182-1183 (7 Cir.), cert. dismissed, 403 U.S. 942, 91 S. Ct. 2270, 29 L. 
Ed. 2d 722 (1971). But cf. Walker v. General Motors Corporation, 362 F.2d 56, 58 (9 Cir. 1966). Subsection (b) focuses 
principally on the ""public use"" criterion for novelty, and, because it is directed primarily at prior use by the inventor, § 102(b) must 
have a less exacting standard of comparison than the strict identity required in the anticipation defense of § 102(a).  See Dix-
Seal Corporation v. New Haven Trap Rock Company, 236 F. Supp. 914, 917-919. (D. Conn. 1964) and the discussion infra at 
pp. 39-41."
82,34," In response to the Court's question on Adversaries' precise position counsel indicated: ""Well, anticipate is a word of art in 
patent law which means that * * * the invention has to fall within the four corners of a single reference.  At least that is one 
reading of the cases * * *.  And we don't contend that they [sic] entire invention of the '432 patent is incorporated in any one of 
those [i.e., the references in A-925].  Our contention is, rather, that by combining the teachings of these arts, it is just a perfectly 
obvious evolution * * *"" (R.T., p. 5697).  This issue of obviousness is discussed below in the context of § 103. "
83,35," In their opening trial brief Adversaries' also cited as a § 102(a) reference the process used by Koratron to manufacture its 
Tubinyl, Tub-pleets, and Nylura lines.  In the Pretrial Order, on the other hand, this ""Tubinyl"" process was listed by Adversaries 
as an alleged prior public use. Since this process is solely a thermoplastic one, it in no way constitutes an anticipation of the 
thermosetting '432 process."
83,36," See n. 11, slip op. at p. 8, supra."
83,37," Koratron vigorously argues that there is no ""Pleetset process."" Pleetset, it contends, is simply the tradename for a variety of 
goods made in various ways at various times.  The evidence indicates, however, that a significant portion of these tradenamed 
goods was pleated skirts produced by means of the resin-impregnation and heat-curing process described more fully below.  
Thus the Court adopts the ""Pleetset process"" phraseology not only for convenience but also because such a designation is 
supported by the evidence."
83,38," ""A person shall be entitled to a patent unless -- * * * (b) the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this 
country, more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the United States"" (35 U.S.C. § 102(b)). "
84,39," By holding that an article can constitute a prior public use of the claimed invention where the differences between the two are 
not patentable, i.e., where they are mere variations obvious to one skilled in the art, the Ninth Circuit has also effectively rejected 
a ""strict identity"" standard for § 102(b).  See Tool Research and Engineering Corp. v. Honcor Corp., 367 F.2d 449, 454 (9 Cir. 
1966), cert. denied, 387 U.S. 919, 18 L. Ed. 2d 972, 87 S. Ct. 2032, rehearing denied, 389 U.S. 893, 19 L. Ed. 2d 203, 88 S. Ct. 
17 (1967); Cataphote Corporation v. DeSoto Chemical Coatings, Inc., 356 F.2d 24, 27 (9 Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 832, 17 L. 
Ed. 2d 67, 87 S. Ct. 71 (1966). This conclusion is reinforced by the Tool Research court's observation that the holding in Stauffer v. Slenderella Systems of 
California, 254 F.2d 127 (9 Cir. 1957) -- which set forth an exact identity standard -- is not contrary to the statement of the 
standard in Tool Research. 367 F.2d at 453. Rather than being mere dictum, as the Tool Research court suggests, the language 
in Stauffer court was discussing ""anticipation"" which strictly speaking arises under § 102(a) while Tool Research dealt with prior 
public use under § 102(b).  See footnote 33, supra."
84,40," This use of the ""obviousness"" concept in the statement of the standard applicable to § 102(b) should not blur the distinction 
between §§ 102(b) and 103.  As indicated above, under § 102(b) the patented process or article is compared against each 
alleged prior use individually while under § 103 the question of the obviousness of the patent claim is determined with reference 
to the prior art as a whole.  Worthington v. Southern New Jersey Newspapers, Inc., 323 F. Supp. 443, 458-459 (D.N.J. 1970)."
84,41," The section, as construed, also allows for ""experimental"" use of the invention without regard to the one year limit.  Smith and 
Griggs Mfg. Co. v. Sprague, 123 U.S. 249, 257, 31 L. Ed. 141, 8 S. Ct. 122 (1887); Robbins Company v. Lawrence 
Manufacturing Company, 482 F.2d 426, 430 (9 Cir. 1973); Pickering v. Holman, supra, 459 F.2d at 406; Cataphote Corporation "
85,," v. DeSoto Chemical Coatings, Inc., supra, 356 F.2d 24, 25-26; and Paraffine Companies v. McEverlast, Inc., supra, 84 F.2d at 
340. By contesting the alleged identity or similarity of '432 and Pleetset, however, Koratron has not, nor could it, argue that 
Pleetset was merely an experimental use of the patented process."
85,42," See Koratron memorandum, dated February 22, 1971, in opposition to Adversaries' motion for partial summary judgment."
85,43," February 20, 1956, was also assumed to be the correct filing date by Judge Doyle in his Memorandum Opinion on summary 
judgment, Jack Winter, Inc. v. Koratron Company, 327 F. Supp. 206, 207 (N.D. Cal. 1971). "
86,44," 35 U.S.C. § 141 et seq., and see current 37 C.F.R. §§ 1.181 et seq., §§ 1.191 et seq., and §§ 1.301 et seq.  Koratron's patent 
office expert Whitmore testified that several administrative avenues existed for challenging an application date when the '432 
patent drawing requirement was made in 1956 (R.T., pp. 1552-1556)."
86,45," In the Pretrial Order Adversaries also cite as a prior public use the process used to make Koratron's Tubinyl garments. These 
garments, however, were made by means of a conventional thermoplastic process in which garment sections made of non-
resinated synthetic fabric were pleated, rolled in bundles and heated before the final steps of garment manufacture. Such a 
thermoplastic process in no way constitutes a prior public use of the '432 process. "
87,46," This same error appears in Adversaries' argument based on the ""simulated garments"" made by Dr. Weaver according to the 
suggestion in the Marsh and Thomas patents of impregnation at the finished garment stage. "
88,47," The Barbed Wire Patent, 143 U.S. 275, 284-285, 36 L. Ed. 154, 12 S. Ct. 443 (1892); Kiva Corp. v. Baker Oil Tools, Inc., 
supra, 412 F.2d 546, 551-552 (5 Cir. 1969); Zachos v. Sherwin-Williams Co., 177 F.2d 762, 763 (5 Cir. 1949) (stating the Fifth 
Circuit rule that ""as a practical matter, * * * oral testimony alone, unsupported by writings, has not been, and will not be accepted 
as sufficient""); A. J. Industries, Inc. v. Dayton Steel Foundry Co., 394 F.2d 357, 361 (6 Cir. 1968) (""oral testimony alone, "
89,," unsupported by any contemporaneous documents, is not the best type of evidence to show anticipation by a prior art device * * * 
[but its use] is not necessarily fatal to defendant's case"").  See also Jones Knitting Corporation v. Morgan, 361 F.2d 451, 455-
456 (3 Cir. 1966). Unlike the Fifth Circuit, the rule in this Circuit is that such oral evidence is not insufficient as a matter of law in 
all cases.  Whiteman v. Mathews, 216 F.2d 712, 716 (9 Cir. 1954). As suggested by A. J. Industries and Jones Knitting, supra, 
however, the Court should subject such testimony to close scrutiny."
89,48," While there is evidence that Ideal did make and distribute aprons to its salesmen and others prior to December 27, 1954, the 
Court finds that these aprons were not garments as that term is used generally and as used specifically in the '432 patent. 
Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1971 ed.) defines a garment to be an article of outer clothing such as a coat or 
dress, exclusive of accessories.  An apron is simply not an article of clothing, as that term is ordinarily used.  It is a flat fabric 
and, even if pleated, is nothing more than pleated fabric. The garment shown in the drawing filed with the '432 patent application 
is 3-dimensional and not 2-dimensional as is an apron.  Moreover, the aprons in question were not baked in the oven nor sold to 
the public.  They were used solely for demonstration purposes and were made during the experimental stages of the 
development of the Ideal process. "
90,49," 35 U.S.C. § 103 provides: ""A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set 
forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that 
the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in 
the art to which said subject matter pertains.  Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was 
made."""
90,50," Koratron urges that the relevant ""art"" be limited to the garment making trade, citing the separation of the fabric and garment 
making industries.  Adversaries have demonstrated, however, that garment makers, including Koratron, often sought technical 
advice from chemical companies such as Sun Chemical, du Pont and Monsanto and from finishers like Ace Dye Works.  The 
Court finds that a more accurate assessment of the relevant level of skill requires that the ""art"" must include fabric production 
and finishing as well as garment making."
90,51," This Court concludes that § 103, as interpreted in Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 15 L. Ed. 2d 545, 86 S. Ct. 684 
(1966), has supplanted the A. & P. doctrine of stricter scrutiny for ""combination"" patents. See slip op. pp. 56-57, infra.  Even if 
this more severe standard were applied to the '432 patent, however, the Court would find this patent nonobvious and, therefore, 
valid. "
91,52," Their qualifications are described at slip op. p. 48, supra. "
92,53," It is instructive to note there that Dr. John T. Marsh, the inventor of this particular patent and the very originator of resin setting, 
observed in a 1968 article that: ""The final condensation [i.e., polymerization or cure] in garment form as opposed to fabric form, may be described as an 
obvious step, but why did not one think of it before?"" Textile Manufacturer, July, 1968 (Exhibit K-3455).  The court in Reeves Instrument Corp. v. Beckman Instruments, Inc., supra, 444 F.2d at 273, found this same kind of expert 
reaction to be noteworthy in reaching the conclusion that the patent in dispute there was nonobvious. Further, the Court notes Adversaries' emphasis on the commercial usage of the Williamson-Dickey process as well as Dr. 
Weaver's simulated garments made according to the Marsh patents. Even if the Court ignored the abandonment of the 
Williamson-Dickey process by Levi Strauss and the questionable relevance of simulated garments made under laboratory 
conditions, the Court finds that Adversaries' product-comparison argument misses the point just as it did in their analysis of 
Pleetset.  See slip op. at pp. 46-47, supra.  The fact that another process may produce durable press garments does not indicate 
that the specific elements of that process make those of '432 obvious, especially when that other process actually points away 
from the '432 method of post-cure."
92,54," Remarks of Associate Judge Giles S. Rich before the Patent Law Associations of Los Angeles and San Francisco, September 
18 and 20, 1972 (pp. 16-17) (emphasis in the original). "
95,55," White testified that he does not believe he actually considered referring to the Tubinyl information in the '432 application but 
that if he had considered it, the Tubinyl reference would have been ""a very irrelevant matter"" and he would never have included 
it (R.T., p. 4904)."
95,56," There is no question that the process used to make both Tubinyl and Nylura garments, as a thermoplastic reference, was in 
no way material to the issuance of the '432 patent. "
96,57, The actual samples submitted by the inventors have apparently been lost by the Patent Office.
96,58," The Examiner's method of impregnating and curing only the creased area was considered by Koratron to be ""so costly and so 
impractical from a production standpoint as to be prohibitive"" (F.W., pp. 25, 27), dangerous to the fabric because of the ""elevated 
temperatures"" required when using a pressing iron (F.W., p. 36), and incapable of producing entirely press-free garments (F.W., 
pp. 36, 44).  Similarly, Koratron considered the suggested method of impregnating the completed garments one at a time to be 
""entirely impracticable"" (F.W., p. 37)."
96,58," a Adversaries cite the second sentence of the concluding paragraph of Paper No. 9 of the File Wrapper (F.W., p. 55) in support 
of their contention that Koratron also used the samples to demonstrate the merits of its claims.  Based on a reading of this entire 
document (Paper No. 9) and the whole File Wrapper, however, the Court finds that the purpose for the submission of the 
samples was to oppose the restriction requirement. "
98,59," That agreement is attached hereto as Appendix B, slip op. pp. B-1-B-8, infra."
98,60," See Appendix B, slip op. pp. B-9-B-11, infra."
98,61," The language of the consent decree is in pertinent part as follows: ""* * * ""(f) Subsequent to March 14, 1961, defendants, without plaintiff's knowledge or consent, infringed said Letters Patent No.  
2,974,432 by making, selling, causing to be sold and/or offering for sale durable press garments in accordance with the 
invention of said Letters Patent; ""AND the plaintiff and defendants having reached a settlement of the issues herein, and defendants having consented to

the Court being fully advised in the premises, as between the plaintiff and defendants, it is ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED: ""* * * ""2.  That, as between the parties, plaintiff is the owner of the patent in suit No.  2,974,432, that said patent was duly and

accordance with the invention disclosed and claimed in said Letters Patent No.  2,974,432; ""* * * ""5.  Defendants have paid plaintiff damages for past infringement; * * * ""* * *"""
98,62," The following press release was issued after the entry of the consent decree: ""In Koratron Co., Inc. a suit for patent infringement.  A consent decree has been entered in the U.S. District Court for the 
Southern District of California against Swede Co., Inc. and ten other defendants named by Koratron Co., Inc.  The suit was 
based on Koratron's Patent No.  2,974,432 covering the use of garment curing ovens in the manufacture of durable press 
garments. The decree upholds the validity of Koratron's patent and provides for a permanent injunction against further 
infringement.  Damages were paid to Koratron."" "
99,," Time magazine, in an article on Koratron in its December 17, 1965, issue, reported that ""the company moves swiftly against 
patent infringements.  [It] recently won a consent decree against Los Angeles' Swede Co. for selling Koratron-processed goods 
without paying royalties."""
99,63," Koratron's president at the time of these negotiations, Herman A. Greenberg, testified that Koratron offered Dan River, as ""an 
outside figure, subject to all sorts of conditions"" (R.T., p. 3947), $2 million dollars for a termination of the Dan River agreement."
99,64," ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal * * *."" 15 U.S.C. § 1."
99,65," Although the opinion of the district court in the Associated Patents case speaks in terms of an unreasonable restraint of trade, 
a horizontal division of a product market is so closely analogous to cases of horizontal territorial division that per se treatment is 
clearly required. "
100,66," Dan River contends that Dan Press fabrics are superior to Koratron-trademarked fabrics in the following respects: Dan Press 
fabrics have no shrinkage problem, in contrast to Koratron-trademarked products; Dan Press fabrics are drier and thus easier to 
handle; they do not have an offensive odor; they have a virtually unlimited shelf life; they need less time in the final oven, the 
likelihood of over-baking thus being slight if not nonexistent, and in fact they can be cured without a final oven baking; and 
finally, a larger volume of Dan Press fabrics can be processed in a much shorter time. "
101,67," The uncontroverted evidence reveals that Dan River's sales personnel did not know of the agreement and thus, Dan River 
argues, could not have taken advantage of it.  This argument against a finding of unreasonable restraint of trade may also be a 
concession that the agreement was not as significantly pro-competitive as Dan River suggests. HN20[
] -"
101,68, Indeed the record indicates that at least several companies did obtain legal advice concerning the scope and validity of '432. 
102,69," The cases cited in support of their position by Adversaries ( La Peyre v. F.T.C., 366 F.2d 117, 121 (5 Cir. 1966); Peelers 
Company v. Wendt, 260 F. Supp. 193, 197-198 (W.D. Wash. 1966); Laitram Corporation v. King Crab, Inc., 244 F. Supp. 9, 17 
(D. Alaska 1965)) each involved an explicit practice of price discrimination.  Here the real gravamen of Adversaries' complaint is 
that Koratron received royalties for the use of materials not within its patent. Adversaries have made a procrustean attempt to 
force this claim into an antitrust mold."
102,70," Dan River's approximate figures for its share of the market: 1964 -- 2.6%, 1965 -- 12.7%, 1966 -- 12.5%, 1967 -- 10.9%, 1968 
-- 9.9%, 1969 -- 10.4%, and 1970 -- 6.7%. "
103,71," An example of a most favorable royalty clause is the following section from a license agreement between Koratron and Henry 
I. Siegal Co., Inc., dated August 1, 1964: ""VIII.  MOST FAVORABLE ROYALTY ""1.  In the event LICENSOR shall by any agreement grant to others, in the same territory and specific fields of this license, 
any license to use said PROCESS to practice the inventions of said Letters Patent and said pending application on more 
favorable terms, LICENSEE shall be entitled to and LICENSOR hereby covenants and agrees to give LICENSEE the 
benefit of such more favorable license, or retroactive to the date of this agreement in the case of a more favorable license 
granted by LICENSOR to another within two years of the date of this agreement, provided LICENSEE accepts and can 
meet all of the terms, conditions and considerations of such more favorable license agreement. ""2.  LICENSOR hereby agrees promptly to notify LICENSEE in respect to any such more favorable license agreement 
executed by LICENSOR, and LICENSEE shall have thirty (30) days after the date of said notice within which to accept the 
terms and conditions of the more favorable royalty license; said acceptance shall be in writing and served as hereinafter 
provided."""
103,72," See slip op. at pp. 8, 27-29, supra. "
104,73," A subsequent edition of the manual contained similar instructions: ""Basically, to illustrate the manufacturing steps in relation to the process, a garment manufacturer purchases chemically 
treated but uncured quality controlled fabric from a KORATRON licensed fabric mill."" In 1966 the manual was changed so that garment manufacturers were instructed to acquire fabrics which had been ""tested and 
approved"" by Koratron."
104,74," ""In 1963, 1964, 1965 we were faced with two things: first of all, the statements of Mr. Tomaselli and Mr. Hochstaedter, that you 
had to buy not only fabrics but Koratron treated sundry items in order to make a Koratron treated good.  Subsequent and some 
place along in that time it became apparent that this was not the language of the license. I couldn't tell exactly when I became 
aware of that.  Even when we did become aware of it, we tried to live within the explanation that was given to us by Mr. Weil that 
we had to buy a Koratron labeled good."" R.T., p. 420."
104,75," See footnote 74, supra. "
105,76," For example, a license agreement with Pepperell Manufacturing Company, effective July 7, 1964, contained the following 
provisions: ""I.  SCOPE ""* * * ""2.  LICENSEE agrees that it will use the licensed mark only in connection with the sale of said fabrics to such garment 
manufacturers as LICENSOR shall designate. ""3.  LICENSOR agrees at LICENSEE'S request to designate as a proper purchaser under preceding paragraphs 1 and 2 
hereof, any garment manufacturer that is licensed by LICENSOR to use said KORATRON trademark in connection with its 
commercialization of press-free or crease retained garments. ""* * * ""6.  Nothing in this Agreement and License shall be construed as limiting or otherwise affecting LICENSEE'S right to sell 
chemically treated fabrics of any nature or quality to others provided that, to insure quality garments made from said fabrics, 
chemically treated noncured fabrics bearing said trademark shall not be made and sold by LICENSEE for use in the 
manufacture of crease retained garments except to those garment manufacturers designated by LICENSOR * * *."" Louis Hochstaedter, then Koratron's vice president, testified that during the period from 1964 through 1967 all license 
agreements between Koratron and textile mills contained a provision such as I(6) in the above agreement.  R.T., pp. 5975, 5976."
105,77," Typical language in these letters, from a letter of August 12, 1965, to an officer of Cone Mills Corporation, is as follows: ""Under our Agreement and License, effective September 2, 1964, you are not authorized to supply uncured fabric to 
garment manufacturers unless designated to you by our Company. ""Heretofore, one of the fabric suppliers has ignored this provision to some extent.  This may have been inadvertent and we 
elect to accept that explanation.  Another mill has sold fabric manufactured under the Agreement and License in "
106,," anticipation that negotiations being carried on by our Company with a given garment manufacturer would be favorably 
concluded so that the prospective buyer of this fabric would be on our 'designated ' list. ""The provision in question has not been amended or modified. ""We trust that we will not have to call your attention again to refrain from making fabric sales under our Agreement and 
License to garment manufacturing companies which are not designated by our Company."""
106,78," Koratron has tried to undermine the significance of these letters by showing the disapproval which Weil expressed to 
Hochstaedter about them.  But Weil's criticism was apparently directed at the use of the phrase ""uncured fabrics"" rather than 
""Koratron trademark fabric."" See R.T., p. 6127.  Koratron also tried to show that a major motivation for the letters was the desire 
to police the use of the patented process. See R.T., pp. 6129-6130."
106,79," See R.T., pp. 6010-6011."
106,80," The letters, signed by Herman A. Greenberg, then Koratron's president, included this paragraph: ""First, before the garment may be sold under the KORATRON trademark, it must pass the Quality Control Standards of 
Koratron Company.  While it is possible for a licensed garment manufacturer to make garments which pass our Quality 
Control Standards although made from fabrics which do not bear the KORATRON trademark, we believe that the way to 
keep the risk of not passing our Quality Control Standards at a minimum is to use KORATRON trademark fabrics, since 
they are produced by fabric mills licensed to use our formulations and application methods which we know are thoroughly 
adaptable to our patented process."" Although Koratron included a sentence in a prospectus dated May 2, 1966, that there was no restriction on licensed garment 
manufacturers as to their source of appropriate fabrics, and although Koratron has indicated that over thirty manufacturers (less 
than one tenth of Koratron's licensed garment makers) were informed individually, mostly by letter, beginning (with the exception "
107,," of one letter in July, 1965) in April, 1966, that there was no such restriction, these letters of February 3, 1967, mark the real 
change in Koratron's licensing practice."
107,81," A major reason for the new license offered to the textile mills in 1967 was Koratron's discovery that its ""know-how"" was not 
confidential; its mill manual had inexplicably been copyrighted in 1965 by its then patent counsel and thus placed in the public 
domain."
107,82," This figure is contained in a letter of that date from Moses Lasky, Koratron's retained attorney, to Howard T. Milman of the 
New York law firm, Sullivan & Cromwell."

109,84," This reversing of the tied and tying products presents no conceptual or analytical difficulties under the theory of tying 
arrangements unless it is shown that the seller had such extensive economic power in one of the markets that further preclusion 
of competition could not result from the tie-in of its power in the other market.  No such situation has been established here."
109,85," Although the tying product was the Koratron-trademarked fabric, the key part of that product, the source of Koratron's leverage 
in the market of the tying product, was the Koratron trademark."
109,86," Koratron also purported to give its mill licensees confidential ""know-how,"" a factor which could have increased its economic 
power in the market for the tying product.  That ""know-how,"" however, was copyrighted in 1965 and thus was placed in the 
public domain.  The Court need not resolve the question of whether the apparently mistaken notion of many licensed mills that 
they were receiving confidential ""know-how"" increased Koratron's leverage in the market for the tied product. "
110,87," There is language in United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U.S. 365, 379-380, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1249, 87 S. Ct. 1856 
(1967), which suggests per se treatment for territorial and customer restrictions imposed vertically by a manufacturer who has 
parted dominion over the goods in question.  That case is distinguishable from this one in that it involved restrictions on resale of 
goods whereas this case concerns restrictions placed upon trademark licensees. Indeed, the Supreme Court expressly reserved 
the question of ""whether a patentee has greater rights * * *"" over the sale of goods produced by its licensees. 388 U.S. at 379, n. 
6. Clearly the question of a trademark licensor's rights also falls within this reservation.  Even if Schwinn were applicable here, it 
is not clear that it mandates per se treatment for all factual situations involving vertical customer restrictions.  See Tripoli 
Company v. Wella Corporation, 425 F.2d 932, 936-937 (3 Cir. 1970) (en banc), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 831, 27 L. Ed. 2d 62, 91 
S. Ct. 62 (1970); Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. United States, 196 Ct. Cl. 35, 449 F.2d 1374, 1380-1382 (1971). But cf.  Williams v. 
Independent News Co., 485 F.2d 1099, 1103 (3 Cir. 1973) (dictum).  The Court of Appeals for this Circuit has not as yet held 
whether Schwinn requires per se treatment where the party imposing the vertical restraint does not itself provide a service or 
retain dominion over a good.  Compare Anderson v. American Automobile Association, 454 F.2d 1240, 1244 (9 Cir. 1972), with 
Beverage Distributors, Inc. v. Olympia Brewing Co., 440 F.2d 21, 28, 30 (9 Cir. 1971) (dicta), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 906, 29 L. 
Ed. 2d 682, 91 S. Ct. 2209 (1971). Whatever the proper interpretation of the ambiguous language in Schwinn, that case clearly 
did contemplate, in line with White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 263, 83 S. Ct. 696, 9 L. Ed. 2d 738 (1963), that the 
rule of reason would apply to a ""newcomer, seeking to break into or stay in the business"" and to a ""failing company."" 388 U.S. at 
374."
110,88," Although nowhere explicitly stated in the opinion in Switzer, this requirement of exclusivity can be inferred from the language 
referring to ""Day-Glo"" marked goods.  297 F.2d 39, 41-42, 44, 48. The goods were identified in the opinion as ""Day-Glo"" goods, 
and the use of other trademarks was not mentioned. "
111,89," Koratron argues that the requirement that a patent licensee use the Koratron trademark on completed garments is simply 
additional consideration, as a form of advertising, for the patent license. Koratron is correct in asserting that consideration is not 
limited to money, but it does not extend to a requirement that violates the antitrust laws.  Every tying arrangement could, if 
Koratron were correct on this point, be justified in this way, since purchase of the tied product could always be characterized as 
additional consideration for the tying product. Koratron also argues that ""[a] person having a patent monopoly may lawfully create a good will therefrom and embody that good 
will in a trademark, which remains a lawful property right if not allowed to fall into the public domain as a generic term."" Persons 
with lawful property rights, however, cannot use them to violate the antitrust laws.  ""A trademark cannot be legally used as a 
device for Sherman Act violation."" Timken Co. v. United States, 341 U.S. 593, 599, 71 S. Ct. 971, 95 L. Ed. 1199 (1951). See 
also United States v. Sealy, Inc., 388 U.S. 350, 356, n. 3, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1238, 87 S. Ct. 1847 (1967); Standard Oil Co. v. United 
States, 337 U.S. 293, 306, 69 S. Ct. 1051, 93 L. Ed. 1371 (1949)."
111,90," Koratron argues that ""no private claim can be based on antitrust law in the absence of adverse impact on the claimant's 
business or property,"" citing cases ( Winckler & Smith Citrus Products Co. v. Sunkist Growers, Inc., 346 F.2d 1012, 1014, n. 1 (9 
Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 958, 15 L. Ed. 2d 362, 86 S. Ct. 433 (1965); Haverhill Gazette Company v. Union Leader 
Corporation, 333 F.2d 798, 802 (1 Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 931, 13 L. Ed. 2d 343, 85 S. Ct. 329 (1964), rehearing 
denied, 379 U.S. 984, 13 L. Ed. 2d 578, 85 S. Ct. 645 (1965)) that seem to require proof of actual injury or damages as an 
element of liability under 15 U.S.C. § 15. The proceedings in this case have been bifurcated, however, with another trial, if 
necessary, to determine damages.  In their stipulated pre-trial order, the parties described the antitrust question to be considered 
in the first trial: ""Did Koratron and/or Koracorp, either singly or in concert, perpetrate acts violative of Section 1 and/or 2 of the 
Sherman Act?"" Koratron expressed its general contentions on the issue of the alleged antitrust violations in its licensing 
practices in the following manner: ""Nothing done or omitted in relation to the general subjects set out in adversaries' contentions 
(a) violated any of the antitrust laws, or (b) affected any party to the litigation in any way."" The Court has proceeded on the basis 
that the first trial would determine whether as a matter of law Koratron had violated the antitrust laws and that the second trial 
would consider the issue of Koratron's ultimate liability to Adversaries for money damages.  Koratron's apparent argument that 
Adversaries had to show actual damages in the first trial, beyond a showing of some impact on them resulting from Koratron's 
unlawful acts, is incorrect. "
112,91," Adversaries included in their opening trial brief other alleged restrictions by Koratron (e.g., that garment makers had to agree, 
as a condition for renewal of their licenses, to an extension of the license agreement beyond the expiration date of the patent), 
but these claims were not pursued at trial and are deemed to have been abandoned."
112,92," ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a 
misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding fifty thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not 
exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court."" 15 U.S.C. § 2. See also 15 U.S.C. § 15. "
114,93," This maximum figure is based upon Koratron's estimate that in 1969 durable press garments constituted 75% of the market for 
men's and boys' dress and casual slacks and that it was receiving royalty payments from 56.4% of the sales of durable-press 
men's and boys' dress and casual slacks made from the post-cure process.  See slip op. p. 90, supra.  The Court finds that this 
evidence on market share is very unclear and that it would be insufficient for a finding of monopolization even if the percentage 
derived from it were higher. "
115,94," Since the decision in Lessig has been reaffirmed by this Circuit following the decision in Walker, Inc. v. Food Machinery, 382 
U.S. 172, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247, 86 S. Ct. 347 (1965), this Court need not address the question whether Walker Process, in effect, 
has overruled Lessig, although such an argument finds support in dictum in Walker Process.  There the Supreme Court stated at 
382 U.S. at 177: ""To establish monopolization or attempt to monopolize a part of trade or commerce under § 2 of the Sherman Act, it would 
then be necessary to appraise the exclusionary power of the illegal patent claim in terms of the relevant market for the 
product involved.  Without a definition of that market there is no way to measure Food Machinery's ability to lessen or 
destroy competition."" "
116,95," Koratron will be given an opportunity to prove that its tying arrangements were justifiable under the rule of Jerrold Electronics 
and that the customer restrictions imposed upon its licensed textile mills and manufacturers of sundries were not unreasonable 
restraints of trade.  See slip op. at pp. 92-99, supra.  If Koratron can show that these practices, during the entire period in which 
they were followed, did not constitute illegal restraints of trade, the Court will reconsider its finding of an attempt to monopolize."
116,96," On this point the Court follows Hallmark Industry v. Reynolds Metals Co., 489 F.2d 8, 12-13 (9 Cir. 1973), and Moore v. Jas. 
H. Matthews & Co., 473 F.2d 328, 332 (9 Cir. 1973), in holding that evidence other than market power can establish a 
dangerous probability of success.  Moreover, where, as here, a patent which has achieved great commercial success is used in 
an attempt to monopolize, dangerous probability of success can almost be presumed."

117,101," Koratron did not make as complete and open a disclosure in its presentation of prior art to the Patent Office as is desirable.  
See slip op. at pp. 63-69. supra.  Perhaps the problem was one of carelessness rather than intentional non-disclosure, but 
applicants for the privilege of a patent monopoly should be precise and complete in their applications.  Under the totality of the 
circumstances present here, however, Koratron's actions in these respects do not come within the doctrine of patent misuse.

maintain high standards of conduct and candor if it is to use its patent properly."

132,6," The blanketing in April and May of 1963 began on the same day as the commencement of the publication of the Pioneer by its 
new owners, the Conrads.  It continued daily for three weeks; and on each day, between 1,600 and 2,000 papers were 
distributed. The blanketing in September and October was continuous for one week; and for the balance of the two-month 
period, it was done each week on Wednesday.  On most of these days, 1,500 copies of the Tribune were distributed. Finally, 
during January of 1965, blanketing took place on eight occasions and between 1,000 and 2,400 copies were distributed on each 
day.  This was followed by blanketing of similar intensity on eight days in February and on seven days in March of 1965."
132,7," We are convinced that the court misstated when it used the term ""restraint of trade"" here.  We are satisfied that the court meant 
to use the term ""attempt to monopolize,"" as that was the question before the court. "
133,8," The court stated that the Pioneer's circulation records were so questionable and unreliable that it would have been improper to 
find a loss in circulation by relying on them.  While this fact precluded the court from estimating the Pioneer's circulation after 
March 31, 1966, it could have determined the paper's circulation with the necessary degree of certainty prior to that date by 
relying on the reports of the Audit Bureau of Circulations (ABC). The ABC report for the nine-month period ending March 31, 1963, shows an adjusted figure for ""Carrier and Dealer"" circulation 
of the Pioneer in Mandan to be approximately 2,250, while the same adjusted figure for the twelve-month period ending March 
31, 1964, is about 1,925.  In reaching these figures, we assumed that the adjustments made were attributable to the ""Carrier and 
Dealer"" category rather than the ""Mail"" category as the latter appeared to have less variation during the years in question.  This 
Mandan reduction of approximately three hundred continued through March 31, 1966, when the Pioneer's last audited report by 
the ABC was prepared.  After that date, the Pioneer terminated its affiliation with the ABC."
133,9," The record reveals that during this period, the Mandan price was five cents per week less than the Bismarck price.  The 
practice of charging less for carrier-delivered Tribunes in Mandan was curtailed on October 26, 1970, but a differential was 
continued in other communities.  Except for the period of September 1966-September 1967, the price of the Tribune by carrier in "
134,," Mandan was less than or equal to the price of the Pioneer by carrier in Mandan.  The higher Pioneer price in the period of 
exception resulted from an increase in the Pioneer's price, and the difference was five cents per week."
134,10," The parties agree that ""price discrimination"" between different purchasers was proven.  See, Federal Trade Com. v. Anheuser-
Busch, 363 U.S. 536, 549, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1385, 80 S. Ct. 1267 (1960), where the Supreme Court held ""a price discrimination within 
the meaning of [§ 2(a)] is merely a price difference."" They also agree, as they had stipulated at trial, that the interstate commerce 
requirements of the antitrust laws were met in this case.  While we are satisfied that there was sufficient connection with 
interstate commerce under the Sherman Act, there is doubt as to whether third commerce requirements of § 2(a) of the Clayton 
Act, was met--i.e., that ""either or any of the purchases involved in such discrimination [were] in commerce."" 15 U.S.C. § 13(a).  
See, e.g., STICKELLS, FEDERAL CONTROL OF BUSINESS-ANTITRUST LAWS § 126 (1972); ROWE, Discriminatory Sales of 
Commodities in Commerce: Jurisdictional Criteria Under the Robinson-Patman Act, 67 YALE L. J. 1155, 1166-1168 (1958). See 
also, Littlejohn v. Shell Oil Company, 483 F.2d 1140 (5th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1116, 94 S. Ct. 849, 38 L. Ed. 
2d 743, 42 U.S.L.W. 3363 (1973). Nonetheless, we decline to examine this question any further because it was not raised by the 
parties and its resolution either way would not affect our disposition of the appeal."
134,11," The term ""commodity"" is not defined in the Act, but it is generally thought to include only tangible items of commerce and not 
services.  See, Tri-State Broadcasting Co. v. United Press Internat'l, Inc., 369 F.2d 268, 270 n. 2 (5th Cir. 1966). See also, 
STICKELLS, FEDERAL CONTROL OF BUSINESS-ANTITRUST LAWS, § 129, at 449-450 (1972); ROWE, Discriminatory Sales 
of Commodities in Commerce: Jurisdictional Criteria Under the Robinson-Patman Act, 67 YALE L.J., supra at 1163-1165.  We 
recognize that the production of a newspaper requires and incorporates the services of a great number of people, but the fact 
remains that when finally published, the paper takes on a tangible form and it is bought and sold in the market place.  As such, it 
is predominantly a tangible good and, thus, a ""commodity"" subject to the Act."
134,12," In reaching its decision as to ""like grade and quality,"" the court appears to have applied the ""market acceptance"" standard.  
While that standard is not without support among the commentators, see, e.g., CASSADY & GRETHER, The Proper 
Interpretation of ""like Grade and Quality"" Within the Meaning of Section 2(a) of the Robinson-Patman Act, 30 S. Cal. L. REV. 
241 (1957), it was rejected by the Supreme Court in Federal Trade Com. v. Borden Co., 383 U.S. 637, 640-641, 16 L. Ed. 2d 
153, 86 S. Ct. 1092 (1966). There, the Court indicated the proper test is that of ""physical comparison."""
134,13," The court appears to have required that the Pioneer prove the Tribune's price discrimination in fact had the prohibited effect on 
competition.  Such a burden is not required under the statute.  It is only necessary for the plaintiff to prove there is a ""reasonable 
possibility"" that the price discrimination may have the prohibited effect on competition.  Federal Trade Com. v. Morton Salt Co., 
334 U.S. 37, 47, 92 L. Ed. 1196, 68 S. Ct. 822 (1948). See, Utah Pie Co. v. Continental Baking Co., 386 U.S. 685, 701, 87 S. Ct.

(Jackson & Frankfurter, J.J., dissenting) and Moog Industries v. Federal Trade Commission, 238 F.2d 43, 61 (8th Cir. 1956), 
where the standard of ""reasonable probability"" was advanced."
134,14," The theory that the price discrimination caused the loss in the Pioneer's Mandan circulation is weakened by the evidence 
showing that the Tribune's Mandan circulation remained stable after it terminated the price differential in October of 1970.  The "
135,," ABC's report for the twelve-month period ending March 31, 1970, reveals that the Tribune's Mandan ""Carrier and Dealer"" 
circulation was then 1,811, while the ABC's report for the twelve-month period ending March 31, 1971, shows the circulation 
increased to 1,895."
135,15," The court indicated it was considering HN7[
] the following factors in determining the award of attorneys' fees: (1) the fact 
that plaintiff's counsel had not had the benefit of a prior judgment or decree in a case brought by the government; (2) the 
standing at the bar of counsel on both sides; (3) the time spent by plaintiff's counsel; (4) the magnitude and complexity of the 
litigation; (5) the responsibility undertaken by counsel; (6) the amount recovered; and (7) the court's knowledge of the quality of 
counsel's work done on the case in and out of court.  See generally, Comment, Attorneys' Fees in Individual and Class Action

143,2," In fact there is no reason, at least in theory, why a satisfactory settlement could not amount to a hundredth or even a

144,," F.2d 689 (2d Cir. 1972), or of the District Court's opinion in Percodani v. Riker-Maxson Corporation, 50 F.R.D. 473 (S.D.N.Y. 
1970), aff'd sub nom., Farber v. Riker-Maxson Corporation, 442 F.2d 457 (2d Cir. 1971), which seems inconsistent with this 
principle misreads those opinions. It might be pointed out that the settlement agreement approved in Sunrise Toyota v. Toyota Motor Company, Ltd., 1973-1 Trade 
Cases para. 74,398, at 93,821 (S.D.N.Y. 1973), did not provide for the payment of any money to the class members."
144,3," Originally, both competitors and subscribers had joined together after the government action in an attempt to coordinate their 
private actions against the alarm company defendants.  Eventually, competitor and subscriber plaintiffs stopped coordinating 
discovery because the interests of the two groups relating to the proof of impact and damages rested upon diametrically 
opposed theories. "
145,4," The defendants were found guilty of monopolizing a national market for accredited central station services.  They argue that no 
matter how their services are defined, they did not compete in a single national market but rather competed in a series of local 
markets so that, at least for the purposes of evaluating impact, defendants' conduct must be judged in terms of the conditions 
and activities in each of the areas.  Defendants also contend that non-interchangeable services, such as burglar and fire alarms, 
should not have been lumped together as part of a single market.  Moreover, defendants object to the failure to take account of 
other types of alarm systems, such as direct collection services, local alarms, telephone answering services, and unaccredited 
central station protection services, in determining the existence of competition. The dissenting members of the Supreme Court agree with defendants that the majority's attempt to define the geographic 
market as ""the nation"" without any consideration for the variances in competition from city to city and its insistence that the 
relevant product market was restricted to accredited central station protection services ""dramatically demonstrates that its [the 
majority's] action has been Proscrustean -- that it has tailored the market to dimensions of the defendants"" and that this 
""gerrymandering market definition"" resulted in a ""strange red-haired, bearded, one-eyed man-with-a-limp classification."" United 
States v. Grinnell, 384 U.S. at 590-91 (dissent of Fortas, J.).  The New York Times reported that after having read Justice Fortas' 
opinion, Judge Wyzanski, the trial judge in the government case, stated that ""Justice Fortas went to the heart of my error . . . If I 
had heard him beforehand, I certainly would have rewritten my opinion."" The New York Times, May 16, 1969, at 20. "
147,5," Appellants judge that legal fees could reasonably amount to ten or fifteen percent of the liability.  If liability amounts to $69 
million, as it would if treble damages were considered, then reasonable attorneys' fees might amount to as much as $10 million if 
victory on the merits were ultimately obtained.  This would bring the base recovery figure to approximately $80 million."
147,6," Total billings during this period amounted to $400 million.  Seven percent of that figure is $28 million, which trebled equals $84

152,10," Among the additional reasons stated by the Editorial Board are the following: ""(1) Rule 23 [of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure] does not authorize the formation of tentative classes for the purpose 
of settlement. (2) There can be no assurance that the class members will be adequately represented in settlement negotiations until the 
findings which are conditions precedent to the formation of the class are made by the court after an opportunity for an 
evidentiary hearing. (3) . . . It will be impossible to determine . . . the amount of money which will be payable to each member of the class.  This 
information would seem to be essential to making any rational choice whether to remain in the class and to accept the 
benefits of the settlement or to opt out. "
153,," (4) . . . there cannot be a fair recognition in settlement negotiations of the potential liability of the party or parties opposing 
the class and the potential damages that might be recovered by the class. (5) Formation of such a class preempts determination of whether the claim for relief should be litigated for the members of 
the class or should be the subject of further pretrial preparation with a view toward securing a better settlement or a trial on 
the merits . . . (6) The formation of the tentative class for the purpose of settlement denies to the class member the choice contemplated 
by the amended Rule 23 to become a member of the proposed class for the purpose of litigation with adequate 
representation as a member of the litigating class. (7) Formation of such a class denies to a member of the class the right to appear in the action as a party and to maintain 
the position of a litigating party. (8) Formation of such a class results in a long delay in preparation of the case for trial of those parties who desire to litigate 
their claims for relief. (9) In the absence of reasonable discovery conducted on an adversary basis by counsel representing the class, it is 
impossible to determine whether the proposed settlement has any relation to the economic facts of life relevant to the case.

of work and by whom performed, namely, partner, senior associate, junior associate or clerk.  The District Court fee award of 
$1.5 million thus compensated him at the rate of $635 per attorney-hour. Appellee has attempted to justify his fee by pointing to other cases where the fee awards were even more grandiose.  He 
observes that in one dispute litigated in the New York State courts, a distinguished practitioner was compensated at the rate of 
$3,590 per hour.  Sullivan and Cromwell v. Hudson and Manhattan Corporation, 35 App. Div. 2nd 1084, 316 N.Y.S. 2d 604

178,6," Professor Moore is a prime advocate of the ""adversity"" requirement advanced by appellant.  He states as a general proposition 
that collateral estoppel is unavailable in subsequent litigation between co-parties unless the co-parties were actual adversaries 
in the prior litigation. See 1B Moore's Federal Practice 0.411[2].  See also Dobbins v. Barnes, 204 F.2d 546, 548 (9th Cir. 1953);

178,9," Thus, Professor Moore--a long-standing advocate of the mutuality doctrine as well as of the adversity requirement--concedes 
that adversity would be unnecessary in jurisdictions that have repudiated mutuality. He states: ""One further exception to the adversity requirement can arise in the small number of jurisdictions that have abandoned the 
principle of mutuality in the doctrine of judicial finality.  In these jurisdictions, an adverse judgment can be urged against the 
unsuccessful litigant by one who was a stranger to the proceedings in which the judgment was rendered; and no reason is 
apparent to prevent similar use of such a judgment by one who was a non-adverse co-party with the unsuccessful litigant in 
those proceedings."""

178,10," Appellant suggests that collateral estoppel is unavailable inasmuch as the relitigation sought to be avoided involves legal, 
rather than factual, issues.  This argument misconceives the nature of the issues involved in the instant matter.  Both the claims 
of antitrust liability and the assertion of the labor exemption involve issues of mixed fact and law. Such issues are subject to the 
bar of collateral estoppel. See Yates v. United States, 354 U.S. 298, 336, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1356, 77 S. Ct. 1064 (1957). "
179,11," 333 U.S. 591, 68 S. Ct. 715, 92 L. Ed. 898 (1948)."
179,12," Appellant charges that: (1) for a period ranging from February of 1970 until the time at which the instant suit was commenced, 
Kraftco maintained a dual price structure, charging Scooper Dooper more for products manufactured in New York than for the 
identical products made in Philadelphia; (2) after Judge Frankel's order, Kraftco raised the preticketed (manufacturer's 
suggested) price of the Sealtest ice cream products manufactured in Kraftco's New York plant; (3) Kraftco has taken no steps 
since Judge Frankel's order to qualify its New York plant in Pennsylvania, thereby precluding the sale of the New York products 
in Pennsylvania; (4) products formerly available to Scooper Dooper at the Philadelphia plant were not made available to the 
distributor at the New York plant after Judge Frankel's order; and (5) after Judge Frankel's order, Kraftco required prepayment 
(twenty-four hours before delivery) from Scooper Dooper at its New York plant, while in Philadelphia Scooper Dooper was able 
to pay at the time of delivery. In its brief on appeal, Kraftco disputes certain of these charges and attempts to justify the remainder.  Appellee's Brief at 17-18, 
n. 10. Inasmuch as we are reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we cannot resolve these factual disputes herein.  Given our 
treatment of the antitrust exemption issue, infra, we find that these factual disputes are immaterial. "
180,13," We do not believe that the last three charges listed in Fn. 12 could have had an appreciable effect in excluding Scooper 
Dooper from the Metropolitan Area. More importantly, we question whether the Schwinn per se rule against territorial restrictions 
would apply even if the combination of ""actions"" actually did exclude appellant from the Area.  In Tripoli Company v. Wella 
Corporation, 425 F.2d 932, 935 (3d Cir.), cert. denied 400 U.S. 831, 27 L. Ed. 2d 62, 91 S. Ct. 62 (1970) this Court, sitting in 
banc, expressly limited Schwinn to its factual context.  We indicated that where a manufacturer's restriction is related to a 
legitimate business purpose, Schwinn may be inapplicable.  425 F.2d at 936-7, n. 3. The apparent objective of the exclusions 
herein--the preservation of work standards--would appear to represent just such a purpose."
180,14," Congress has seen fit to grant labor unions a limited exemption from antitrust liability.  See 15 U.S.C. § 17, 29 U.S.C. §§ 52, 
101-115.  Provided that unions act in their own self-interest in an area which ""is a proper subject of union concern,"" and provided 
that unions do not combine and conspire with non-labor groups, the statutory exemption is available.  See United States v. 
Hutcheson, 312 U.S. 219, 232, 85 L. Ed. 788, 61 S. Ct. 463 (1941); see also Intercontinental Container Transport Corp. v. New 
York Shipping Association, 426 F.2d 884, 887 (2d Cir. 1970). In the prior litigation, Judge Frankel held that even if Kraftco's unions were guilty of antitrust violations, the labor exemption from 
the antitrust laws would immunize the unions from antitrust liability.  In the instant case, it is the employer (Kraftco) and not the 
unions who seeks to invoke the antitrust exemption. We reject Scooper Dooper's contention that the labor exemption is unavailable to employers.  Such a proposition would 
undermine the vitality of the exemption by discouraging bargaining on the part of management.  To preserve the integrity of the 
negotiating process, HN5[
] employers who bargain in good faith must be entitled to claim the antitrust exemption. See Philadelphia World Hockey Club, Inc. v. Philadelphia Hockey Club, Inc., 351 F. Supp. 462, 499 (E.D. Pa. 1972). We similarly reject any contention that the issues faced by Judge Frankel and this Court differ merely because the party claiming 
the exemption herein (Kraftco) differs from the parties (the unions) which claimed same in the prior litigation. The labor 
exemption to the antitrust laws applies to the bargaining agreement, the product of negotiations between unions and 
management. See Local Union No. 189, Amalgamated Meat Cutters & Butcher Workmen of North America, AFL-CIO v. Jewel 
Tea Co., 381 U.S. 676, 689, 14 L. Ed. 2d 640, 85 S. Ct. 1596 (1965) (""Employers and unions are required to bargain about 
wages, hours and working conditions, and this fact weighs heavily in favor of antitrust exemption for agreements on these 
subjects."").  Judge Frankel ruled, in effect, that the bargaining provision quoted at the outset of this opinion gives rise to the labor 
exemption. Kraftco is asserting no more in the instant case. "

181,16," The District Court, although assuming the ""collusive"" purpose of the Mota affidavit, nevertheless was unpersuaded by Scooper

action.  In the California Motor Transport case the defendant group had allegedly instituted the administrative and judicial 
proceedings and actions, with or without probable cause, and regardless of the merits of the cases.  Their purpose was not to 
influence a policy-making function, such as the defendants in the instant action, but to bar their competitors from meaningful 
access to adjudicatory tribunals and to discourage and ultimately prevent the plaintiffs from invoking the processes of the 
administrative agencies and courts. The California Motor Transport decision furnishes insight to what is meant by the term ""sham"", but in so doing it does not aid the 
plaintiff at bar because it has not been shown here that defendants were guilty of fraud, corruption or misuse of the state 
processes.  See Semke v. Enid Automobile Dealers Association."

212,1," A typical payment process for a $100 advertisement placed through an agency would be as follows: The ad is submitted by the 
advertiser or its agency to the representative which sends it to the college newspapers designated by the advertiser. Each 
newspaper runs the ad and returns ""tear sheets"" to the representative to confirm the printing, together with a bill.  The 
representative checks the copy to verify that the ad was correct with regard to size, appearance, etc.  The advertising agency is 
then billed $100, and, in turn, bills its client $100.  Of the $100 paid to its agency by the advertiser, the agency receives a 
commission of 15% plus 2% of the balance.  Hence, the agency would retain $16.50 ($15 plus 2% of $85, or $1.70), and would "
213,," remit the $83.30 balance to the representative.  Presently, NEAS and CASS take a 25% commission of this amount, or $20.83.

with papers represented by NEAS."
214,5," Unless a national advertiser has a specific reason to reach smaller schools, it is more economical for the company to place 
advertisements in large college or university papers as the line rates do not vary directly with enrollment. Thus, the size of a 
school is a major consideration of national advertisers in deciding to place ads in college papers. "

226,16," Appellants have directed our attention to various cases which they contend stand for the proposition that the APA does not 
preclude review in this case. Examination of these cases reveals that none concerns the non-adjudicative consent negotiation 
procedure.  Pepsico, Inc. v. FTC, 472 F.2d 179 (2d Cir. 1972) concerned intervenors who sought review of a cease and desist 
order which purportedly affected their rights directly.  In Rettinger v. FTC, 392 F.2d 454 (2d Cir. 1968) and Robertson v. FTC, 
415 F.2d 49 (4th Cir. 1969) petitioners seeking review were actual respondents in past proceedings which culminated in cease 
and desist orders. The question presented in both cases was whether proceedings begun subsequent to the issuance of cease 
and desist orders were ""reopened adjudicatory proceedings"" or ""compliance"" proceedings. The circuit courts in both cases 
denied jurisdiction. In Elmo Division of Drive-X Co., Inc. v. Dixon, 121 U.S.App.D.C. 113, 348 F.2d 342 (1965), appellant was a 
party to a prior consent decree, and the question was whether the district court had jurisdiction to entertain a suit by appellant to 
enforce procedural rights which the Commission had granted to him in its prior decree. Thus, none of these cases has any bearing whatever on the question sub judice."

Coniglio stated, was to urge restoration of the name ""American Football League,"" and use of the AFL's emblem, both of which 
had been dropped when the merger became effective in 1970."

234,9," Coniglio has included in the record a number of newspaper articles in which professional football coaches rationalize poor 
performance during the exhibition season on the experimentation theory."
234,10," Coniglio does not suggest that this monopoly position was in any way secured in contravention of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 
§§ 1, 2."
234,11," As of 1970, the closest major league professional football team to the Buffalo Bills was the Cleveland Browns, some 189 miles 
away."
234,12," We are not unaware of the recent commotion over the nascent World Football League (WFL), which is slated to begin its first 
season of play this summer.  Coniglio does not contend, however, that the WFL was even a glimmer in anyone's eye in 1970. "
236,13," Of course, we do not mean to suggest that the consumer lacks standing to raise a Sherman Act claim where he can prove that 
a foreclosure of competition in violation of Section 1 caused him injury by, for example, artificially elevating prices.  See e.g. 
Fortner Enterprises, Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., supra, 394 U.S. at 497."
236,14," We note that the record before us does not present a convincing case for conspiracy in any event.  The Bills instituted the 
challenged season ticket package policy in 1966, four years before they entered the NFL, although admittedly at a time when 
Pete Rozelle was, according to his own affidavit in support of the motion for summary judgment, the Commissioner of both the 
AFL and the NFL. Moreover, of the 26 teams in the NFL following the merger, at least 10 did not utilize a season ticket sale 
policy even remotely similar to that used by the Bills. "
238,1," Title 28A became effective January 1, 1972.  However, prior to that date its predecessor, Title 28, as well as Article 10 of Title 
10 of the Alabama Code, contained similar provisions pertaining to insurance generally and to title insurance specifically which 
are now codified in Title 28A.  Regulation prior to 1972 was not materially different from that provided in the current Insurance 
Code."
238,2," The McCarran Act itself was prompted by the Supreme Court's decision in U.S. v. Southeastern Underwriters Assn., 322 U.S. 
533, which itself involved charges of violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. "
244,1," For the purpose of deciding this motion it will be assumed that the '011 patent was owned by Ernest Scragg & Sons, Ltd., 
because Lex-Tex has not contended otherwise.  However, on the face of the Agreement it provides that ""Ernest Philips (illegible) 
Scragg is the owner of"" the '011 patent."
244,2," The second fact states that the three patents are licensed to the trade independently or jointly, depending on wishes of the 
licensee. This fact might be material if Celanese was alleging a tying violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.A., § 1, 
which, of course, it is not.  Unfortunately, the bulk of the Lex-Tex brief addresses itself to the Sherman Act and its application to 
these facts -- a non-existent issue. "
245,5," This is often the case where patents covering improvements of a basic process, owned by one manufacturer, are granted to 
another.  A patent may be rendered quite useless, or ""blocked"", by another unexpired patent which covers a vitally related 
feature of the manufacturing process. . . . (emphasis supplied)"
245,3," Another definition of a ""blocking"" patent is contained in International Manufacturing Co. v. Landon, Inc., 336 F.2d 723, 731 (9 
Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 988, 85 S. Ct. 701, 13 L. Ed. 2d 610 (1965): . . . If we had a case where a licensee could produce a commercially acceptable product utilizing one patent but not 
infringing the others in the package, then clearly we would not have a case involving blocking patents."
245,4," Hearing on Motions for Summary Judgment, April 11, 1974, at p. 8."
245,5," Lex-Tex raised two issues that should be mentioned in passing.  The assertion that the misuse claim by Celanese should not 
be heard by the Court because it has previously been waived is not persuasive.  The pleadings support the contention, and that "
246,," is that.  Also, Lex-Tex should be advised not to waste time advancing its argument that the acquisition of the '011 patent was in 
fact procompetitive. . . . because there in one hand was [sic] all patents which affected this industry . . . and the opportunity [was] there for the 
industry at large to come to one person who had the disc package and know that they could undertake production without 
concern for being sued for infringing patents. As the Supreme Court said in United States v. Masonite Corp., 316 U.S. 265, 281, 62 S. Ct. 1070, 1079, 86 L. Ed. 1461 (1942), 
""[it] is outside our competence to inquire whether the result was or was not beneficent or whether the evil was or was not 
realized."""
246,6," Lex-Tex asserts infringement and must therefore concede coverage.  The incorporation of the '912 patent by reference into the 
'229 patent brings this motion in the preview of the second portion of the agreement. "
247,7," Obviously the use of the Barmag machine in a way that would otherwise infringe the '912 patent must be claimed by that

258,17," Hearing on Motions for Summary Judgment, April 17, 1974, at 87-88."
258,18," The memorandum went into great detail in attempting to demonstrate the existence of the conspiracies and combinations 
complained of, apparently on the theory that if they were proven to in fact exist the Court would be loath to dismiss the 
counterclaims.  However, for the purposes of this motion, the court must presume, whether it believes the charges or not, that 
actual violations did take place. "
272,1," The appellants' original motion for leave to file an amended answer alleged that purportedly illegal oral agreement between the 
appellee and the appellants was part of the contract sued upon and that this illegality, arising from violations of federal antitrust 
laws, constituted an affirmative defense to enforcement of the contract.  However, at argument on this motion, the appellants 
also took the position that this exclusive purchase agreement violated Michigan Antitrust laws, M.S.A. § 28.51 and 28.52, thus 
constituting another affirmative defense to its enforcement.  On appeal, the appellants appear to have abandoned the purported 
affirmative defense based on federal antitrust law violations.  We therefore only analyze the validity of alleged Michigan 
antitrust law violations as an affirmative defense to the enforcement of the contract in issue.  However, federal law is helpful in 
determining the Michigan law on the issue before us. "
274,2," Indeed, we were advised at oral argument that appellants have sued Medusa in federal court for the alleged violation of the 
federal antitrust statutes in connection with the same alleged oral agreement here complained of.  This action is presently 
pending. "
278,*, Sitting by designation.
278,1," During most of the period in question, the rate per column-inch in the Daily Reflector was $1.60.  Thus an advertiser could 
place a one-inch ad in either the Daily Reflector or the Shoppers Guide for $1.60, or he could run his ad in both for $2.40.  The 
same rate structure applied to long-term advertising at contract discounts; the advertiser could contract for advertising in the 
Shoppers Guide for half the cost of the newspaper contract."
278,2," Plaintiff complains that the masthead of the Shoppers Guide shows the combined circulation of the Daily Reflector and the 
Shoppers Guide.  Apparently there is no intentional misrepresentation as the masthead states that the total circulation of the 
Daily Reflector and the Shoppers Guide is 24,000; each publication has an independent circulation of about 12,000."
278,3," The parties differ sharply over the proper construction of the complaint.  Plaintiff contends that it alleges both monopolization 
and an attempt to monopolize. Defendants insist that the phrase ""attempted to maintain their dominant monopolistic position and "
279,," destroy competition"" alleges only an attempt.  The district court treated plaintiff's inartful language as an allegation of an attempt 
to monopolize, apparently without considering whether it also alleged monopolization. Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(f), and in the spirit 
of avoiding the pitfalls of common law pleading, we cannot perceive any harm in allowing plaintiff to proceed on both theories.  
Defendants have alleged no prejudice, and the issues of market definition and monopoly power have been developed in 
discovery."
279,4, The amended complaint contained the following allegation of jurisdiction:
279,2," .  This Court has jurisdiction of this action because: a.  The matter in controversy arises under an act of Congress regulating commerce or protecting trade and commerce 
against restraints and monopolies (28 U.S.C.A. § 1337); and b.  The matter in controversy arises under the Sherman Antitrust Act, Secs. 1 and 2 (15 U.S.C.A. §§ 1 and 2), and the 
Clayton Act, Secs. 4 and 16 (15 U.S.C.A. §§ 15 and 26). The defendants' answer gave the following response to paragraph 2 of the complaint:"
279,2," .  The defendants do not contest the jurisdiction of the Court. Then, after making admissions and denials to specific allegations in the complaint, the answer stated AS A FURTHER ANSWER AND DEFENSE, THE DEFENDANTS ALLEGE:"
279,1," .  The Amended Complaint fails to state a claim against the defendants, or any one or more of them, upon which relief can 
be granted. On March 2, 1973, plaintiff served a set of interrogatories on defendants asking for particularization of the contention that plaintiff 
had failed to state a cause of action.  Defendants declined to answer, asserting that they were not required to answer legal 
questions.  Plaintiff's brief in this court states that defendants first raised the interstate commerce issue on April 30, 1973, in their 
brief in support of summary judgment. The deadline for discovery was May 2. "
280,5," In United States v. International Boxing Club, 348 U.S. 236, 99 L. Ed. 290, 75 S. Ct. 259 (1955), the Supreme Court held that 
an enterprise was in interstate commerce by virtue of receiving 25% of its revenue from interstate operations.  In Times-
Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 602 n. 11, 97 L. Ed. 1277, 73 S. Ct. 872 (1953), the Court followed 
Lorain Journal without mentioning the amount of interstate advertising involved.  Of course, it may have been willing to assume 
that the major daily newspapers in New Orleans carried a ""substantial"" volume of national advertising."
280,6," The issue we outline is not the same as the inquiry required by the ""effects' test of interstate commerce under the Sherman Act. 
If the newspaper is found to be operating in interstate commerce by virtue of carrying an adequate volume of intestate 
advertising, the Sherman Act will apply without a showing of the quantitative effecton the interstate market. SeeUnited States v. 
Shubert, 348 U.S. 222, 226-227 & n.8, 75 S. Ct. 277, 99 L. Ed. 279 (1955); Las Vegas Merchant Plumbers Ass'n v. United 
States, 210 F.2d 732, 739-740 n.3 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 348 U.S. 817, 75 S. Ct. 29, 99 L. Ed. 645 (1954); cf. Rasmussen v. 
American Dairy Ass'n, 472 F.2d 517, 526-528 (9th Cir. 1972)."
280,7," United States v. Lorain Journal Co., 92 F. Supp. 794 (N.D. Ohio 1950). "
281,8," Defendants have also argued that the Sherman Act does not apply in this case because the newspaper's interstate contacts 
are only incidental to the alleged anticompetitive conduct. This may be true of the plaintiff's allegations that the newspaper 
purchases paper and ink from in and out of state and prints substantial quantities of national and international news, but the 
alleged monopolization is directed specifically at the Greenville advertising market. If plaintiff proves that this market is ""in 
commerce"" and that defendants' acts constituted monopolization or a restraint of trade, prohibition of defendants' conduct would 
be justifiable as a means of protecting interstate commerce in advertising. See Rasmussen v. American Dairy Ass'n, 472 F.2d 
517, 526-527 (9th Cir. 1972). This case is therefore unlike Savon Gas Stations No. Six, Inc. v. Shell Oil Co., 309 F.2d 306 (4th 
Cir. 1962), and Lawson v. Woodmere, Inc. 217 F.2d 148 (4th Cir. 1954), in which the alleged restraints were unrelated to the 
interstate aspects of the businesses involved. "
282,9," The same affidavit states that the Shoppers Guide showed a total profit of $1,476.84 for the last 18 weeks of this period, 
projecting from this figure a future annual profit of $4,266.60.  As plaintiff points out, however, the 18-week period defendants 
selected (Nov. 1, 1972, to Feb. 28, 1973) included the lucrative Christmas advertising season.  The higher profit figure is 
therefore an unreliable index for projecting year-round revenues."
282,10," Defendants' affidavits and answers to plaintiff's interrogatories show that their figures include the cost of postage and carrier 
delivery, sales commissions on shopper advertisements, and the cost of newsprint, ink, electricity, and ""materials."" The figures 
do not include any portion of personnel costs or ""fixed costs of building, equipment and other facilities."""
282,11," Defendants' insistence that the Shoppers Guide merely represents an additional use of equipment and facilities that would 
otherwise go unused seems at least slightly inconsistent with another of defendants' affidavits, which states that long-range 
planning for a shoppers guide was a factor in the building and expansion program undertaken by the Daily Reflector in 1969, 
and that additional equipment was ordered for that purpose."
282,12," To quote Mr. Justice Clark's now-classic language from Poller v. CBS, ""summary procedures should be used sparingly in 
complex antitrust litigation where motive and intent play leading roles, the proof is largely in the hands of the alleged 
conspirators, and hostile witnesses thicken the plot."" 368 U.S. at 473. HN7[
] "
283,13," Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).  The rule provides only that failure to furnish specific facts in response to a supported motion for 
summary judgment may result in granting the motion if summary judgment is appropriate."
283,14," Because the district judge ruled only on the allegation of an attempt to monopolize and concluded there was no specific intent 
to exclude competition, he found it unnecessary to define the relevant market or determine defendants' share of it."
283,15," This calculation is based on defendants' figures for the Daily Reflector and the weekly newspapers in Pitt County.  It is unclear 
whether these figures include advertising sold by the Raleigh News and Observer, which publishes a weekly page of ""Eastern 
Carolina"" advertising. Defendants' deposition testimony suggests that the Raleigh paper's only sales to Pitt County merchants 
appear on this weekly page. "
284,16," The Supreme Court's generous treatment of conspiracy allegations in Albrecht v. The Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145, 149-50, 19 L. 
Ed. 2d 998, 88 S. Ct. 869 (1968), and Poller v. CBS, Inc., 368 U.S. 464, 7 L. Ed. 2d 458, 82 S. Ct. 486 (1962), offer general 
support for this exception.  See also ABA Section of Antitrust Law, Antitrust Developments 1955-1968, at 19 n. 84 (1968). "
287,1," The history of the litigation of the damage issue is as follows: The district court allowed the damages sustained by Zenith as 
estimated by their own experienced officials.  Hazeltine Research, Inc. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 239 F. Supp. 51, 76 (N.D. Ill. 
1965), the appeals court reversed on this issue, holding Zenith had failed to prove the fact of damage with respect to the 
Canadian pools as a proximate result of the alleged unlawful conspiratorial activities.  Hazeltine Research, Inc. v. Zenith Radio 
Corp., 388 F.2d 25, 35-39 (7th Cir. 1967); the Supreme Court reversed and remanded for the judgment of the district court to be 
reinstated.  Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 116-25, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129, 89 S. Ct. 1562 (1969); on 
remand the appeals court formulated a ""measure of proof,"" Hazeltine Research, Inc. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 418 F.2d 21, 25-26 "
288,," (7th Cir. 1969), but on appeal the Supreme Court, without discussion of this standard ordered the court to reinstate the original 
district court judgment with respect to the Canadian market.  Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 401 U.S. 321, 349, 
28 L. Ed. 2d 77, 91 S. Ct. 795 (1971). "
294,1," This action originally named the Arlington County Bar Association and the Alexandria Bar Association as additional

294,2," On the lighter side we note in passing that it appears that the Goldfarbs were actively seeking what might be termed

combinations or conspiracies among individuals. The decisions we have cited conclusively demonstrate that the prohibitions of the statute [Sherman Act] apply even though 
the parties to a contract indulge the belief that the agreement may have beneficial results and actually show that in some 
respects the public is benefited thereby.  Congress has determined that the greater good is served by the maintenance of 
free competition and its decision in the field of interstate commerce must control.  Pennsylvania W. & P. Co. v. Consolidated G., E.L. & P. Co., 184 F.2d 552, 559 (4 Cir. 1950).

297,11," Id. at 350 and 352. It is interesting to note that it was not a case where individuals initially decided to take action, conspired to regulate 
competition and prices in the industry, and then received governmental approval through legislative action.  On its surface 
such a sequence of events would appear to be an attempt by a state to grant immunity to those violating the Sherman Act.

warehouse floors, at auction. Such tobacco boards of trade as may now exist, or which may hereafter be organized, are authorized to make reasonable 
rules and regulations for the economical and efficient handling of the sale of leaf tobacco at auction on the warehouse 
floors. . . . . . . Nothing in this section shall authorize the organization of any association having for its purpose the control of prices or the 
making of rules and regulations in restraint of trade."
297,14," A warehouse owned by C. T. Day was handling twenty to twenty-five percent of the leaf tobacco sales in Asheville.  Because 
of the Board's regulations, however, Day's warehouse was only allotted eight to nine percent of the total selling time.  Both Day 
and the F.T.C. claimed the regulations were directly restraining his trade."

practicing lawyers in the State.  These fees are paid into the Virginia Treasury, credited to the State Bar Fund (§ 54-52) and 
used in administering the regulatory functions of the State Bar. "
300,26," Both government and individuals rely on the legal profession for guidance in their daily transactions.  The practice of law is 
essential to the smooth functioning of our socio-economic system, a system based on the theory of ""rule by law."" Indeed, a 
responsible legal ""industry"" is vital to Virginia and every state of the Union.  The parties have not argued to the contrary."
300,27," It is apparent from a reading of the nine Canons that the Virginia Code of Professional Responsibility is primarily for the benefit 
of the public and especially for those members of the public who become clients of attorneys.  The Canons are statements of 
axiomatic norms, expressing in general terms the standards of professional conduct expected of lawyers in their relationship with 
the public and the legal system.  They embody the general concepts from which the Ethical Considerations and the Disciplinary 
Rules of the ethics code are derived. (1) A lawyer should assist in maintaining the integrity and competence of the legal profession. (2) A lawyer should assist the legal profession in fulfilling its duty to make legal counsel available. (3) A lawyer should assist in preventing the unauthorized practice of law. (4) A lawyer should preserve the confidences and secrets of a client. (5) A lawyer should exercise independent professional judgment on behalf of a client. (6) A lawyer should represent a client competently. (7) A lawyer should represent a client zealously within the bounds of the law. (8) A lawyer should assist in improving the legal system. (9) A lawyer should avoid even the appearance of professional impropriety. For a detailed discussion of the Canons and more specifically the Ethical Considerations and Disciplinary Rules see Rules of the 
Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia, Part 6, § I-II (as amended Jan. 1, 1971)."
300,28," It is interesting to note what a minuscule part suggested fees play in the total scheme of regulation. The Virginia Code of 
Professional Responsibility is divided into nine major sections, each headed by one of the Canons listed in note 27, supra.  
Under each of the nine Canons there are Ethical Considerations (advisory in nature) and Disciplinary Rules (mandatory in 
nature).  Concentrating on the Disciplinary Rules, those that attorneys must follow, we note that they are broken down further 
into various sections and subsections.  To find reference to minimum fees in the Disciplinary Rules we must look to Canon 2.  
The Disciplinary Rules of that Canon have ten major divisions.  (DR 2-101 to DR 2-110).  DR 2-106 has three subdivisions.  
Under subdivision (B) there are eight separate sections.  Section 3 refers to minimum or customary fees charged in the locality.  
Clearly minimum fees play but a small part in the total picture of regulation of the ""industry."" For a more detailed listing of the 
sections of DR 2-106 see note 30, infra."
300,29," Our conclusion that the ethics code primarily benefits the public is bolstered by the logic of the United States Supreme Court in 
Lathrop v. Donohue, 367 U.S. 820, 843, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1191, 81 S. Ct. 1826 (1961). Both in purport and in practice the bulk of State Bar activities serve the function, or at least so Wisconsin might reasonably 
believe, of elevating the educational and ethical standards of the Bar to the end of improving the quality of the legal service 
available to the people of the State. . . .  It cannot be denied that this is a legitimate end of state policy.  "
301,," Additional support can be found in the case of Semler v. Oregon Bd. of Dental Examiners, 294 U.S. 608, 612, 79 L. Ed. 1086, 55 
S. Ct. 570 (1935). The community is concerned with the maintenance of professional standards which will insure not only competency in 
individual practitioners, but protection against those who would prey upon a public peculiarly susceptible to imposition 
through alluring promises. . . .  And the community is concerned in providing safeguards not only against deception, but 
against practices which would tend to demoralize the profession by forcing its members into an unseemly rivalry which 
would enlarge the opportunities of the least scrupulous.  What is generally called the ""ethics"" of the profession is but the 
consensus of expert opinion as to the necessity of such standards."
301,30," Such a myopic view can be misleading.  Although minimum fees may in some cases provide more than adequate 
compensation for services rendered, their appearance in DR 2-106 is for the purpose of establishing reasonable fees.  The 
ethics code states that it is necessary to establish what is a reasonable fee to insure that clients are not charged an excessive 
fee.  In part, the HN6[
] Virginia Code of Professional Responsibility DR 2-106 (Jan. 1, 1971), provides: (A) A lawyer shall not enter into an agreement for, charge, or collect an illegal or clearly excessive fee. (B) A fee is clearly excessive when, after a review of the facts a lawyer of ordinary prudence would be left with a definite and firm 
conviction that the fee is in excess of a reasonable fee.  Factors to be considered as guides in determining the reasonableness 
of a fee include the following: (1) The time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the 
legal service properly. (2) The likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment 
by the lawyer. (3) The fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services. (4) The amount involved and the results obtained. (5) The time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances. (6) The nature and length of the professional relationship with the client. (7) The experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services. (8) Whether the fee is fixed or contingent.  [Emphasis added.]"
301,31," The State Bar is controlled by its Council, composed of six members appointed by the Supreme Court of Virginia, and the 
President, the immediate Past-President, and the President-Elect of the State Bar, as ex officio members; additional members of 
the Council, composing the bulk of the membership, are elected by lawyers from the judicial circuits of State. "

goods, or buying and selling in commerce or exchange.  But I am clearly of opinion, that such is not the true sense of the 
word, as used in the 32d section.  In the first place, the word 'trade' is often and, indeed generally, used in a broader sense, 
as equivalent to occupation, employment, or business, whether manual or mercantile.  Wherever any occupation, 
employment, or business is carried on for the purpose of profit, or gain, or a livelihood, not in the liberal arts or in the 
learned professions, it is constantly called a trade.""  "

304,38,"  A lawyer shall not enter into a business transaction with a client if they have differing interests therein and if the client

304,39,"  The basic responsibility for providing legal services for those unable to pay ultimately rests upon the individual lawyer. . . .  
Every lawyer, regardless of professional prominence or professional workload, should find time to participate in serving the

those practicing before the court.  Agreement to accept such employment at the statutory rate, even if less than the schedule fee

the plaintiff was utilizing a service in the course of his interstate travel and that integral part of the interstate transportation of 
persons."
307,51,"  However, despite the increased thrust of federal commerce power as business operations become more interrelated and 
complex, the courts have consistently required that in order for federal antitrust jurisdiction to be sustained the effect on 
interstate commerce of an alleged antitrust violation in a local area must be direct and substantial, and not merely 
inconsequential, remote or fortuitous. Page v. Work, 290 F.2d 323, 332 (9 Cir. 1961), cert. denied 368 U.S. 875, 7 L. Ed. 2d 76, 82 S. Ct. 121 (1961)."
307,52," We can find no logic which would support the position that the defense of a state criminal prosecution, or the trial of a divorce 
case would fall within the scope of interstate commerce. These activities are covered by the minimum fee schedule and the 
plaintiffs insist on appeal that we consider the entire fee schedule as an integral unit.  We agree that the schedule is an integral 
unit and that real estate services are not the type of unique services whose exclusive dedication to interstate commerce requires 
separate consideration.  See United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U.S. 218, 91 L. Ed. 2010, 67 S. Ct. 1560 (1947)."

308,," competition restrained by the alleged price fixing agreement ""is local in nature."" Hence the action was dismissed for failure to 
sufficiently plead jurisdiction essential to a Sherman Act case."
308,54," We recognize that our conclusion that no federal jurisdiction exists with respect to the Association under the Sherman Act may 
also apply to the State Bar.  However, since the district court has found, upon a valid ground, that the State Bar is not liable we 
have chosen to affirm the decision of the court in that respect for the reasons cited by it."
308,55,"  There is an obvious distinction to be drawn between a course of conduct wholly within a state and conduct which is an 
inseparable element of a larger program dependent for its success upon activity which affects commerce between the 
states. . . . This Court has on occasion determined that local conduct could be insulated from the operation of the Anti-Trust 
laws on the basis of the purely local aims of a combination, insofar as those aims were not motivated by the purpose of 
restraining commerce, and where the means used to achieve the purpose did not directly touch upon interstate commerce."" United States v. Frankfort Distilleries, Inc., 324 U.S. 293, 297, 89 L. Ed. 951, 65 S. Ct. 661 (1945)."
308,56," We do not pretend to state precisely where that line has been drawn.  Lawson v. Woodmere, Inc., 217 F.2d 148 (4 Cir. 1954), 
is the leading case in this Circuit as to what constitutes a direct and substantial burden on interstate commerce. Although 
analogies in such matters are seldom helpful we find the remoteness in the instant case far greater than that in Lawson where 
this court found that no jurisdiction existed. With respect to the remoteness issue, this case can be compared to Gordon v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., 330 F.2d 103 (7 Cir. 
1964). There the plaintiff was engaged in the business of providing a telephone answering service for businesses, many of 
which were engaged in interstate commerce. The defendant, a local telephone company, allegedly discontinued a particular 
switchboard operation to drive the plaintiff out of business.  Plaintiff brought an action for treble damages under the Sherman 
Act. In affirming dismissal of the action on appeal the court said the fact that ""a few of plaintiffs' customers are engaged in 
interstate commerce is too unrelated a factor to impress plaintiffs' operation with an interstate character within the meaning and 
ambit of the Sherman Act."" Id. at 106. "

391,4," This display of gladiator-type advocacy appears to be prevalent in patent-antitrust suits.  See Clark, the Risks and Costs of 
Patent Litigation: A House Counsel's View, 1973 Utah L.Rev. 618, 619-23, in which a patent attorney discusses the personal 
bitterness and burdensome, harassing discovery process in such suits.  As an example, the author discusses the companion 
case to this suit in which many of the same parties are involved.  In re Yarn Processing Patent Validity Litigation (M.D.Fla.1968-
present) is a consolidated multi-district case of 51 suits involving Leesona Corp., the chief competitor of the associates herein.  
In that case, four million documents have been produced and 250 witnesses deposed.  This consolidated multi-district case 
embraces 37 suits.  Here, only one million documents have been produced and a mere 85 witnesses deposed. "
394,5," The throwsters have been using the terminology that the associates had ""knowledge"" of the invalidity of Leesona's Permatwist 
patents in the terminated Boston and South Carolina lawsuits. Such a characterization is inapposite because an attorney cannot 
""know"" that a patent is invalid but only can render a professional opinion that there is a substantial likelihood that a court would 
find the patent invalid.  A patent does not become invalid until declared so by the final appellate court and therefore there can be 
no such ""knowledge"" of invalidity, only surmise thereof. "

415,2," There were approximately 1,440,000 shares of MP outstanding on December 19, 1973."
415,3," The current expansion of MP's Joppa plant will raise the company's capacity to 14,000,000 barrels. Apparently because the 
modern Joppa facility can accommodate a new kiln without wholesale alterations throughout the plant, the company will be able 
to increase annual capacity by about 4,000,000 barrels at the relatively modest cost of approximately $2.87 per barrel of annual 
capacity. "
416,," Traditionally, cement capacity has been measured in barrels, although the industry is in the process of converting to the use of 
tons.  One ton of cement is equal to about 532 barrels. We shall refer to capacity in barrels throughout since the parties used 
that scale in most of the proceedings in this case."
416,4," MP's market share figures have been a source of some controversy here.  They were provided by Richard J. Whyte, MP's Vice 
President of Sales, who stated in an affidavit that he derived the figures ""from my 15 years experience in the marketing of 
cement as well as my knowledge of competitive factors in these metropolitan area markets."" His affidavit gave no indication how 
precise the figures purported to be or what boundaries he had used for each metropolitan marketing area.  Cargill complains that 
Whyte's figures give no time period for the alleged market shares, and that they fail to take into account the production capacity 
of plants near each geographical submarket, which could readily increase their shipments to the market.  Cf. United States v. 
General Dynamics Corp., 415 U.S. 486, 94 S. Ct. 1186, 39 L. Ed. 2d 530, 42 U.S.L.W. 4368, 4371-73 (1974) (past production 
statistics not necessarily the best index of ability to compete in the future). "
417,5," MP has river terminals at Decatur, Alabama; Nashville, Tennessee; Owensboro, Kentucky; Louisville, Kentucky; Peoria, Illinois; 
and Chicago, Illinois, in addition to those at Memphis and Omaha."
417,6," Cargill's net income for fiscal 1973 was $107,800,000 on sales of $5,300,000,000.  Over the last five years, its high volume-low 
margin approach has produced net profits of 1.3% of sales.  The district court's opinion contains a more detailed account of 
Cargill's development and diversification programs."
417,7," Cargill's Finance Department did a parallel study of possible tender offer candidates in the cement industry and concluded, as 
did the Salt Department, that MP was the best prospect."
417,8, The committee also determined to look into the possibility of purchasing the Amcord Cement Company. 
418,9," Erwin Kelm, Cargill's chief executive, noted that upon investigation both Valley and Coplay were found to be high overhead 
operations, without adequate transportation facilities."
418,10," Cargill argued below that the smallest proper geographical market in this case is the eleven-state area in which MP sells 
cement. For the purposes of this appeal, however, Cargill assumed the correctness of the district court's geographic submarket 
determinations, although it challenged the validity of MP's market share figures, see fn. 4, supra. In support of its claim that the metropolitan areas are the relevant markets, MP cites United States Steel Corp. v. FTC, 426 F.2d 
592, 596 (6 Cir. 1970), followed in Mississippi River Corp. v. FTC, 454 F.2d 1083, 1090 (8 Cir. 1972). In the U.S. Steel case, the 
court approved the FTC's finding that the proper geographic market for ready-mixed concrete was Metropolitan, while the proper 
market for portland cement was regional (including an area extending from Maryland to New Hampshire). At the trial on the merits, the district court should give careful consideration to additional economic factors in determining 
whether metropolitan areas are realistic geographical markets for portland cement. For example, the sales range from each 
terminal may be limited to roughly 200 miles, as the court below found, but a producer can substantially expand the sales range 
from a single plant by installing terminals in more distant markets, as a number of companies such as Atlantic, Dundee and 
Huron have done.  Since installing terminals is relatively cheap, the barriers to entry into a given metropolitan submarket may be 
so low for any regional producer that it is unrealistic to consider each metropolitan area as an independent market. Also, even accepting the district court's conclusion that metropolitan areas are the proper geographical markets, we do not find it 
at all clear how Cargill's acquisition of MP could have an adverse competitive effect in the Omaha market.  There Ash Grove 
Cement, with a large plant at Louisville, Nebraska, on the Platte River, has acquired 62% of the market as against the 21% 
obtained by MP through barging cement from its plant at Independence, Missouri, 2% by Ideal Cement which has a plant in 
South Central Nebraska, and 10% by Lone Star Cement, the country's second largest cement producer. So far as appears from 
the record, any improvement of MP's position seems as likely to be at the expense of Ash Grove as of Lone Star or Ideal; the 
effect of the acquisition on the Omaha market may therefore be affirmatively pro-competitive, cf.  Brown Shoe v. United States, 
370 U.S. 294, 319, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510, 82 S. Ct. 1502 (1962). See Note, Toehold Acquisitions and the Potential Competition 
Doctrine, 40 U. Chi. L. Rev. 156, 179 (1972) (""the second largest firm in a very concentrated market might be available as a 
toehold [and therefore legal acquisition] when the largest firm has 60 percent of the sales); see also Fox, Toehold Acquisitions, 
Potential Toehold Acquisitions and Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 42 Antitrust L.J. 573, 582 (1973). If necessary, any issues 
concerning the Omaha market can be further explored on remand. "
419,11," Since MP already has a fleet of 34 river barges specially equipped for cement transportation, it is not clear that Cargill's 
barging facilities would be of substantial aid; in any event, barging would not be used in the St. Louis and Kansas City markets, 
where MP plants are located.  The alleged similarities in marketing and production between cement and bulk commodities are 
not impressive.  Even though both salt and cement require mining facilities and are often sold in bulk lots to industrial users, 
these similarities are not the sort that would be likely to produce overwhelming competitive advantages through the joint 
operation of the two enterprises.  Finally, salt production is an extremely small part of Cargill's business -- about 6/10 of 1% in 
sales."
419,12," As was noted in ABA, Antitrust Developments 68 (1968), a conglomerate merger is not necessarily anti-competitive, but may 
actually promote competition as, for example, ""where the conglomerate enterprise displaces a stagnant or inefficient firm in an 
industry dominated by a few powerful firms."" See also Note, 72 Mich. L. Rev. 837, 852 (1974). "
420,13," The context in which the ""china shop"" comment was made lends support to the view that Cargill's entry might well be 
procompetitive.  The head of the Salt Group reported that Dundee's representative ""felt if Cargill was getting into cement that he 
would offer his advice so our entry wasn't too disruptive.  He said 'the cement industry is a china shop and with Cargill's size and 
aggressiveness I don't want the bull to do too much damage.'"" The record affords no indication that Cargill had any interest in 
the proffered advice."
420,14," MP also relies heavily on Kennecott Copper Corp. v. FTC, 467 F.2d 67 (10 Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 909, 94 S. Ct. 
1617, 40 L. Ed. 2d 114, 42 U.S.L.W. 3555 (1974), the facts of which are closer to those here presented than any of the Supreme 
Court cases.  However, that decision has been cogently criticized, 86 Harv. L. Rev. 772 (1973), and while we surely would not 
be prepared to say without further study of the facts that we disagree with it, we are equally unprepared to accept it as correctly 
interpreting § 7."
420,15," The El Paso case provides little guidance because the anticompetitive effect of El Paso's acquisition of its sole prospective 
competitor was so obvious that the Court was not pressed to explore the limits of the potential competition doctrine.  Even 
though Pacific Northwest Pipeline was not technically a current competitor of El Paso in the California market, the Court noted 
that Pacific's threats to El Paso's hegemony there had already had demonstrable effects on the price of natural gas in California, 
376 U.S. at 654-55. Where the prospective competitor has made a concerted effort to break a monopolist's hold on the market, 
the line between potential and actual competition loses much of its significance.  ""Unsuccessful bidders,"" the Court concluded, 
""are no less competitors than the successful one,"" 376 U.S. at 661. "
421,16," In noting that the Pennsalt-Olin joint venture ""may well foreclose any prospect of competition between Olin and Pennsalt,"" 378 
U.S. at 173, the Court seemed to be primarily concerned about the future anti-competitive effect of eliminating an actual potential 
entrant. In a later passage, however, the Court wrote, ""the existence of an aggressive, well equipped and well financed 
corporation engaged in the same or related lines of commerce waiting anxiously to enter an oligopolistic market would be a 
substantial incentive to competition which cannot be underestimated,"" 378 U.S. at 174, which seems to look to the present 
procompetitive effect of a potential entrant poised on the edge of the market."
421,17," The Court in Penn-Olin pointed out that Olin was a purchaser of sodium chlorate for internal consumption and that the process 
used in making sodium chlorate was ""intimately related to other operations of Olin and required the same general knowledge."" 
378 U.S. at 166. Pennsalt had long been involved in the production of sodium chlorate in the West, and had marketed the 
product in the Southeast for several years."
421,18," For a perceptive analysis of the Procter & Gamble case and its implications, see Handler, Twentieth Annual Antitrust Review -- 
1967, 53 Va. L. Rev. 1667 (1967)."
421,19," Although Mr. Justice Harlan in his concurring opinion, 386 U.S. at 586, professed to think that the Court ""certainly cannot 
mean to set its judgment on the facts against the concurrent findings [on this issue] below"" by both the FTC and the Sixth Circuit, 
we are not so sure it did not do precisely that, and with much reason."
421,20," This is obviously not true here.  There is no evidence that anyone in the cement business thought of Cargill as a potential 
entrant until Cargill publicized its interest in the spring of 1973, or that anyone will regard it as such a prospect if its acquisition 
efforts fail.  Putting the matter another way, the nature of Procter's business was so close to the bleach industry that it was and 
would continue to be looked on as a likely potential entrant. The nature of Cargill's business is so different from the cement 
industry that it seems almost certain it had never been looked upon as a potential entrant and will no longer be if it is denied 
access in what it rationally considers to be the only feasible way.  The judge's finding ""that Cargill is just as likely an entrant into 
the cement industry as Procter was into liquid bleach,"" while correct enough if limited to the point that Cargill may have wanted 
to enter the cement business as much as Procter & Gamble wanted to enter the liquid bleach business, is in clear error if meant 
to imply -- and this is what is really significant -- that Cargill would be viewed as remaining as likely a potential entrant as Procter 
even if its acquisition of a major cement producer was blocked. "
422,21," Procter was the nation's leading advertiser, spending more than $80,000,000 a year on advertising and an additional 
$47,000,000 on sales promotion."
422,22," Ford Motor Co. v. United States, supra, 405 U.S. 562, 92 S. Ct. 1142, 31 L. Ed. 2d 492, upon which MP relies, has little or no 
bearing here.  The Court in that case approved a district court holding that Ford's acquisition of a substantial spark plug plant 
violated § 7.  Since Ford was a primary consumer of spark plugs, the case presented a classic instance of vertical foreclosure.  
In addition, since Ford would continue to need spark plugs as long as it manufactured automobiles and trucks, it was clearly a 
potential de novo entrant into the industry.  No such vertical foreclosure was even suggested to exist in this case."
422,23," This holding was in the portion of Mr. Justice White's opinion that was joined by Mr. Justice Douglas, giving it the support of 
four members of the Court of seven, see fn. 25, infra."
422,24," Because of this, the result was a remand rather than a reversal."
422,25," Mr. Justice White wrote for the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Blackmun and himself. Mr. Justice Douglas joined in Part I of Mr. 
Justice White's opinion but would have preferred to reverse and direct judgment for the Government.  Mr. Justice Marshall 
thought the finding of no intent to make a de novo entry was based on inadequate exploration of the facts.  Mr. Justice 
Rehnquist and Mr. Justice Stewart dissented.  Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Powell did not participate. "
423,26," In footnote 15 of his opinion, the district judge referred to the fact that the district court in Falstaff ""faced evidence that 
management had consistently rejected de novo or toe-hold entry,"" 410 U.S. at 530, but said ""there is no such evidence in the 
instant case."" With respect to de novo entry, virtually all the evidence was that way.  At one point during the hearings, even MP's 
counsel conceded that Cargill ""can't enter de novo."""
423,27," So also is the fact that there had been de novo entrants into the cement business in the 1960's.  We can take judicial notice 
how far construction costs have outpaced commodity prices since that time. "
424,28," Even if Valley could compete actively in Memphis or St. Louis from its plant on the Yazoo River in Mississippi, Cargill had 
concluded that Valley suffers from poor quality limestone, limited reserves and river conditions that make barging on the Yazoo 
impossible in certain seasons."
424,29," Texas Industries, with a terminal in Memphis, already competes in that market to a limited extent, apparently by shipping from 
its Artesia, Mississippi, plant. However, that company would not seem to be a likely toe-hold prospect at this point since its 
Mississippi plant has more than 40% of that state's production capacity and its Texas plant has about 1/3 of the production 
capacity in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area.  Gifford-Hill poses much the same problem.  The Arkansas Cement Co., with 10% of the 
Memphis market, is probably too substantial to be considered a true toe-hold candidate; in any event it appears to be a leading 
seller in Arkansas."
424,30," Cargill also argues with considerable force that, even if MP could show that there were reasonable toe-hold prospects, it would 
also have to show that Cargill was one of the most likely entrants, since otherwise its elimination as a potential entrant would not 
have an appreciable anti-competitive effect.  MP's proof in this regard was not very impressive.  Any cash-rich, diversifying 
corporation in a bulk, non-consumer industry might be equally attracted to cement. And though conclusions either way are 
speculative at this point, it would appear that other cement companies or ready-mix concrete companies would be at least as 
likely as Cargill to enter the relevant markets, particularly since present regional producers can ordinarily extend their sales 
range simply by installing distribution terminals in new marketing areas, see fn. 10, supra.  This point also deserves further 
exploration on remand."
424,31," Professor Turner noted that the ""deep pocket"" theory loses force where there are rivals large enough to counterbalance the 
acquiring firm's size, which is certainly the case here, see Turner, supra note 1, at 1360.  As pointed out in Note, 86 Harv. L. 
Rev. 772, 783 (1973), where small potential entrants would be intimidated by a large present market occupant, the addition of 
another large figure in the market would have little incremental effect.  MP makes the further argument that the present 
occupants of the field, though large, are not as cash-rich as Cargill, and that it is Cargill's liquidity that would impress and 
discourage potential entrants. This theory, however, has too much speculation in it to provide a sound basis for decision at this 
point. "
425,32," There is no per se proscription against large size in an acquiring firm, see Reynolds Metal Co. v. FTC, 114 U.S. App. D.C. 2, 
309 F.2d 223, 230 (1962) (Burger, J.); Smith-Victor Corp. v. Sylvania Elec. Prods. Inc., 242 F. Supp. 315, 319-20 (N.D. Ill. 1965), 
although in FTC cases the courts have been quite generous in accepting Commission findings that in particular circumstances 
the purchaser's ""deep pocket"" has an anti-competitive effect, see, e.g., Ekco Products Co. v. FTC, 347 F.2d 745 (7 Cir. 1965) 
(acquiring firm's financial resources used to maintain merged firm's monopoly position in its market); General Foods Corp. v. 
FTC, 386 F.2d 936 (3 Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 391 U.S. 919, 88 S. Ct. 1805, 20 L. Ed. 2d 657 (1968) (product-extension merger 
in which General Foods' power in the household market would endanger the balanced duopoly in the steel wool soap pad 
market); United States Steel Corp. v. FTC, 426 F.2d 592 (6 Cir. 1970) (vertical integration; U.S. Steel's connections in related 
industries and its financial power raised entry barriers); Kennecott Copper Co. v. FTC, supra (approving Commission finding that 
Kennecott would use ""deep pocket"" to acquire vast coal reserves and thus compete for long-term utility supply contracts).  On 
the other hand, in Stanley Works v. FTC, 469 F.2d 498, 520 (2 Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 928, 37 L. Ed. 2d 155, 93 S. Ct. 
2750 (1973), Judge Mansfield, with the apparent support of the majority on this point, see id. at 501-02 n. 8, observed that even 
though Stanley's assets were more than three times as great as the largest cabinet hardware sales company in the country, the 
FTC had failed to prove how the merger had raised barriers to entry.  The Commission had not shown that the merger had in 
any way affected initial start-up costs, that it had increased the need for product differentiation, or that it had increased the need 
for sales promotion and advertising.  In that case, as in this one, mere recitation of the ""deep pocket"" shibboleth was not enough."
425,33," Both parties have called our attention to a 1966 report on the cement industry by the staff of the FTC, entitled Economic 
Report on Mergers & Vertical Integration in the Cement Industry.  While the report views the decreasing number of companies in 
the industry with some alarm, the fears are directed at acquisitions by companies already in the industry or in a downward 
vertical relationship.  This seems to favor Cargill's contention that such companies rather than outsiders are viewed by the 
industry as the most likely potential entrants, see fn. 30, supra.  MP answers by insisting that because the FTC has opposed 
mergers between ready-mix concrete companies and cement producers, ready-mix companies cannot be considered potential 
entrants. But whatever the objections to vertical mergers between concrete and cement firms, there would plainly be no valid 
antitrust objection to a ready-mix concrete company entering the cement market de novo, see Ford Motor Co. v. United States, 
supra, 405 U.S. at 567-68 (1972), quoting from the district court's opinion, 286 F. Supp. 407, 441 (E.D. Mich. 1968), if this was 
feasible. "
426,34," As is well known, the phrase was originated by Judge Frank in Associated Industries v. Ickes, 134 F.2d 694, 704 (2 Cir.), 
vacated as moot, 320 U.S. 707, 64 S. Ct. 74, 88 L. Ed. 414 (1943), with respect to attacks on government action, specifically the 
construction of the phrase ""person aggrieved"" in § 6(b) of the Bituminous Coal Act of 1937.  Today the standing of the 
Associated Industries over which Judge Frank had to labor so hard would not require much discussion or the development of a 
new metaphor.  Compare Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 25 L. Ed. 2d 184, 
90 S. Ct. 827 (1970). "
427,35," It is of critical importance to note that in balancing the interests of the tender offeror, the target company, the target's 
shareholders and the public, the Gulf & Western court placed heavy emphasis on its finding that the proposed acquisition was 
probably unlawful.  Gulf & Western's right to invest on behalf of its shareholders ""can only be so where a lawful acquisition or 
investment is involved,"" the court wrote, and in that case it found that ""the probability that the 'investment' is unlawful, as shown 
above, is sufficiently strong to call into serious question G & W's right to proceed with the tender offer,"" 476 F.2d at 698. The 
public interest in barring the acquisition was also held to be a direct function of the strength of the plaintiff's antitrust and 
securities law claims, 476 F.2d at 698-99. Since we have found against MP's probability of success on its antitrust claim, the 
balance of the various interests is necessarily quite different from that struck in Gulf & Western.  A recent note wittily entitled, 
The Courts and the Williams Act: Try a Little Tenderness, 48 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 991, 1009-10 (1973), points out this important 
distinction of Gulf & Western. "
428,36," In taking into account the interests of A&P in preliminary blocking Gulf & Western's tender offer, this court relied on a finding in 
the district court that ""the executives of A&P have already suffered a tremendous downgrading of morale with just the suggestion 
that the company was about to be taken over by G&W."" 476 F.2d at 698. We think district judges should take arguments of 
serious harm to a corporation due to jitters in executive suites with a fair amount of salt; the demoralizing effect, if any, would 
generally be limited to the fairly short period that tender offers usually run.  In any event, no such finding was made here, and 
none would have been justified from the record."
428,37," The contract provided that if the chairman should leave the company because of a change in duties, a transfer out of the St. 
Louis area, or a reduction of compensation, his pay would nevertheless be unaffected. "
429,38," This was the result of the temporary injunction in the Gulf & Western case.  As against the $20 per share offered by Gulf & 
Western, A&P shares are now selling at approximately $13 and have sold as low as $8.75, following the abandonment of the 
tender offer. While these prices doubtless reflect the general decline in stock prices, they show that management's success in 
forcing the abandonment of a tender offer is by no means an unmixed blessing for the shareholders of the target company.  See 
also Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co. v. White Consolidated Indus., Inc., 414 F.2d 506, 510-11 n. 8 (3 Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 
1009, 90 S. Ct. 567, 24 L. Ed. 2d 501 (1970); Schneiderman, Preliminary Relief in Clayton Act Section 7 Cases, 42 Antitrust L.J. 
587, 590, (1973); Note, 40 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 771, 772 n. 7 (1965)."
429,39," In probing the legislative history of the 1950 amendment, Chief Justice Warren pointed to the final Senate report and other 
evidence indicating that the statutory words ""may be substantially to lessen competition"" required a showing of a reasonable 
probability of an anticompetitive effect, not a mere possibility, Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, supra, 370 U.S. at 323 & n. 39."
429,40," The conditions, as set out in the Offer to Purchase, were as follows: Certain Conditions of the Offer.  The Purchaser shall not be required to purchase or pay for any Shares tendered if, before 
the time of payment therefor, in the judgment of the Purchaser's management: (a) Missouri shall have issued or authorized the issuance of additional securities of any class or issued or authorized the 
issuance of other securities in respect of, in lieu of, or in substitution for the now outstanding Shares (except pursuant to a 
dividend or distribution required to be remitted to the Depositary pursuant to Section 6 of this Offer), or (b) Missouri or any of its subsidiaries shall have entered into an agreement or otherwise committed itself with respect to a 
merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets, disposition of assets, or other comparable event not in the ordinary course of 
business, or (c) there shall have been instituted or threatened any action or proceeding before any court or administrative agency, by 
any governmental agency or any other person, challenging the acquisition by the Purchaser of the Shares or otherwise 
relating to this Offer, or otherwise materially adversely affecting Missouri or the Purchaser. "
430,41," The letter went on to assail Cargill for offering a tender price substantially below the true value of the MP shares, to warn that 
shareholders who tendered now could be locked in from December 27 to February 17 by the terms of the offer, and to extol MP's 
prospects for growth and high profits."
430,42," These were: (1) Cargill had not sufficiently disclosed its financial condition; (2) it had offered to supply financial information 
privately to some MP stockholders; (3) it misrepresented that it did not intend to change the business; (4) it misrepresented to 
MP's management that it would not make a tender offer; (5) it failed to disclose the means of financing the tender offer; (6) it 
failed to disclose its own belief that MP shares were worth substantially more than $30; and (7) it failed to disclose that its 
acquisition of MP would violate § 7 of the Clayton Act."
430,43," MP's brief seems to proceed on the assumption that Cargill would simply donate capital to MP -- an assumption surely 
contrary to fact unless Cargill acquired all of MP's stock or merged MP with itself, in which event MP's stockholders would no 
longer care. "
431,44," ""But the circumstances in both cases supported a conclusion that the position of the companies and the market conditions 
were such as to make the probability of antitrust violations clearly apparent at the time of the offer, and the Offer to Purchase 
should have included such a statement if any conscientious attempt had been made to state basic facts material to shareholders 
in reaching their decisions.  Here, however, it would not have been unreasonable for Cargill's management to have concluded 
after appropriate inquiry that no substantial antitrust obstacles stood in the way of its acquisition. Therefore, under the 
circumstances before us, the possibility that the acquisition would result in antitrust violations, a possibility that exists with every 
merger, need not have been disclosed to Missouri Portland's shareholders."""
431,45," It is also worth noting that here Cargill's offer was for all of MP's stock whereas Gulf & Western's was for only 15% of A&P's.  It 
is hard to see the materiality of a possible antitrust violation to an MP stockholder who had tendered and been paid for all his 
stock."
431,46," These were: (1) MP had falsely represented that tendering stockholders would be ""locked in"" until February 17, 1974; (2) it 
had falsely represented that the stock distribution had increased the value of each shareholder's investment by 25% and that the 
distribution was made because of the company's improved financial performance rather than to deter Cargill's tender offer; (3) it 
had falsely stated that the intrinsic value of each share of MP stock was $138; (4) it violated § 10(b) of the Securities Exchange 
Act by purchasing shares of its own stock without disclosing various facts about its financial condition and expansion plans; (5) it 
failed to disclose its alleged § 10(b) violations; (6) it violated § 14(e) of the Exchange Act by stating that the $30 offer price was 
too low, yet not disclosing that it had instructed that its own purchases not be made at a price above $30 per share; (7) it 
recommended rejection of the tender offer before filing a Schedule 14D form; (8) it breached a fiduciary duty to its stockholders 
by authorizing the stock dividend solely to preserve control by incumbent management. "
432,47," We do not draw the favorable inference urged by MP from the fact that similar contracts had already been executed with its 
other officers.  All these were executed after Cargill's initial approach to MP, although prior to its announcement that it would 
make a tender offer. "
433,48," Probably much will depend upon the circumstances.  If the first offer was a failure and the time gap short, a court would be 
likely to hold that the statute applied; per contra if the time gap was substantial and there had been a general increase in stock 
prices. "
438,1," A direct writer sells through its salaried sales force, which promotes only the line of insurance sold by the employer.  An agency 
company obtains insureds through placement of risks with it by independent agents, who are not employed by any insurance 
company, and who usually are able to, and do, place risks with more than one agency company. "
439,2," This is discussed more fully at pp. 15-17, infra."
439,3," It was not feasible to buy or use X-dates in Connecticut because the Insurance Commissioner had stated that the sale of X-
dates was contrary to the agency licensing laws of the state and that non-licensed persons who solicited X-dates would be 
prosecuted.  See note 5, infra. "
441,4," The Hartford's letter to its agents went out on June 6, 1962.  Aetna's rejection was on July 17, 1962. "
442,5," Although it does not seem indisputable that the acquisition and sale of an X-date is a solicitation of insurance, it cannot be 
gainsaid that X-date data can ultimately generate income only in the hands of a licensed agent who through the use of such data 
sells insurance to customers whom he would not otherwise have contacted. The Commissioner's determination that dealing in X-
dates constitutes the solicitation of insurance is entitled to great deference, since it represents the interpretation of a statute by 
the administrator charged with its administration.  See Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16, 13 L. Ed. 2d 616, 85 S. Ct. 792 (1965). It should be noted that Connecticut's regulation of insurance solicitation has been expressly exempted from the otherwise 
superseding effect of federal law. The McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1012(b), provides that: ""No Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of 
regulating the business of insurance, or which imposes a fee or tax upon such business, unless such Act specifically relates "
443,," to the business of insurance: Provided, That after June 30, 1948, the Act of July 2, 1890, as amended, known as the 
Sherman Act, and the Act of October 15, 1914, as amended, known as the Clayton Act, and the Act of September 26, 
1914, known as the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, shall be applicable to the business of insurance to the 
extent that such business is not regulated by State law."" The Supreme Court has stated that this Act ""did not purport to make the States supreme in regulating all the activities of 
insurance companies; its language refers not to the persons or companies who are subject to state regulation, but to laws 
'regulating the business of insurance. ' Insurance companies may do many things which are subject to paramount federal 
regulation; only when they are engaged in the ""business of insurance "" does the statute apply. . . .  [Whatever] the exact scope 
of the statutory term, it is clear where the focus was -- it was on the relationship between the insurance company and the 
policyholder. Statutes aimed at protecting or regulating this relationship, directly or indirectly, are laws regulating the 'business of 
insurance. '"" (Emphasis in original.) S.E.C. v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U.S. 453, 459-460, 89 S. Ct. 564, 21 L. Ed. 2d 668 
(1969). It thus appears that while approval and licensing of X-date dealing and dealers by state insurance authorities might remove such 
business from the ambit of federal antitrust law, the disapproval by state authorities of trafficking in X-dates places the 
traffickers between the state government's Scylla and the federal government's Charybdis.  If punitive action by the state is 
successfully defended against by establishing that X-dates do not fall within state statutes regulating the business of insurance, 
then the X-date dealers are ipso facto open to federal antitrust liability.  As I discuss hereinafter, see p. 27 et seq., infra, the risk 
of such liability seems considerable when the sale of X-dates is proposed on an exclusive basis."
443,6," HN4[
] Rule 56, Fed. R. Civ. P., provides in pertinent part: ""(c) . . . [Summary] judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, 
and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and 
that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. . . . "". . . . ""(e) . . . When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not 
rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but his response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this 
rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.  If he does not so respond, summary 
judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against him."" "
444,7," It should be noted that the plaintiffs did not make any concrete offer to sell X-dates to any particular defendant.  They invited 
offers from the defendants and from numerous other insurance companies, reserving to themselves the right to select which 
offer they would accept.  And in so reserving the right to themselves to select which one agency insurance company they would 
deal with on an exclusive basis, the plaintiffs did not limit their choice to among any offers which might have been made by the 
defendants in this case.  Thus the defendants could not, by their own collusive refusal to deal with plaintiffs, have protected their 
flanks against the possibility that some other insurance company would elect to deal with the plaintiffs and hence secure 
exclusive access to the plaintiffs' X-dates.  The defendants' refusal to bid on the plaintiffs' proposal did nothing to prevent the 
plaintiffs from selling their X-dates to other potential customers, including dozens of competing insurance companies and 
thousands of independent insurance agents. "
445,8," This is an appropriate place to note that the defendant CAIA, an association of Connecticut insurance agents, is not a 
competitor of any of the defendant insurance companies and that the plaintiffs never offered any proposal to it.  The only 
apparent reason for making the association a party defendant emerges from the plaintiffs' argument that insurance agents, when 
they later learned of the plaintiffs' proposal, told the insurance companies that they were opposed to it.  This they contend 
amounts to some kind of coercion to force the companies to reject the proposal.  Apart from the fact that the decisions by the 
companies were made before the CAIA knew about them, the argument cuts against the plaintiffs' main contention that the 
rejections by the companies were the result of their having agreed among themselves to act in concert. "
446,9," ""Economic arrangements between companies standing in a supplier-customer relationship are characterized as 'vertical.'"" 
Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 323, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510, 82 S. Ct. 1502 (1962)."
446,10," There were three dissenters in White Motor, Warren, Ch. J., Black, J., and Clark, J., who took the position that such vertical 
arrangements should be held forthwith to be per se violations. "
447,11," That such a monopoly was the design of the plaintiffs is indicated by the price they proposed.  The charge for X-dates which 
the plaintiffs set for the first batch they sold was 30 cents each; the price which the plaintiffs placed upon X-dates under the 
proposal for exclusive use was 45 cents each to two separate non-competing buyers, or a total of 90 cents.  No examination into 
the cost of production is needed to understand that no appreciable cost would be incurred in multiplying the number of copies 
produced of lists of X-dates in order to make them available to hundreds of insurance companies -- and thousands of insurance 
agents. "
448,12," A thoroughly reasoned opinion by Judge Wyatt in United States v. Chicago Tribune - New York News Syn., Inc., 309 F. Supp. 
1301 (S.D.N.Y. 1970), holds that an agreement by a copyright owner ""not to license the features to any other newspaper 
published within an arbitrary and unreasonably broad territory surrounding the contracting newspaper's city of publication"" 
(emphasis in original) states a claim of an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of the antitrust laws. 309 F. Supp. at 1302. 
Judge Wyatt ruled that writings protected by the Copyright Act do not confer upon their owner any greater right to sell or license 
the use of the copyrighted material under exclusive-dealing agreements than that possessed by an owner of any other kind of 
property.  It would thus seem, a fortiori, that agreements by which secret X-dates are sold or licensed for use so as to foreclose 
nationwide their dissemination to other than the agents of a single purchaser, might well constitute an unreasonable restraint of 
trade. "
452,1," While appellees alleged that all the appellants sought to disguise the surcharge as a local tax, they then further alleged that the 
charges were variously labeled ""Tx Tms"", ""Rm Tx"", ""Sundries"", ""Misc."", ""In Tms"", or ""GMS."" Moreover, some defendants 
charged a flat fee, while others charged varying percentages of the room rate. "
454,2," The appellees allege a far wider conspiracy than heretofore alleged in massive class actions.  See Eisen v. Carlisle & 
Jacquelin, 52 F.R.D. 253 (S.D.N.Y. 1971) (two alleged conspirators); West Virginia v. Chas. Pfizer & Co., 314 F. Supp. 710

455,3," In Cherner v. Transitron Electric Corp., 201 F. Supp. 934 (D. Mass. 1962), distribution costs in administering the damage fund

the Large Class Action, 87 Harv. L. Rev. 426, 430 n. 31 (1973)."
455,4," As we stated in In re Multidistrict Vehicle Air Pollution M.D.L. No. 31, 481 F.2d 122, 130 (9th Cir. 1973): ""Insofar as the common weal was injured the federal government was the proper party to seek redress . . . .  If the 
Government did not prosecute its action with sufficient vigor, the remedy lies in executive or legislative reform, not in judicial 
overreaching."" "
456,5," This opinion was written prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 94 S. Ct. 2140, 
40 L. Ed. 2d 732 (1974), which affirmed Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 479 F.2d 1005 (2d Cir. 1973). We see nothing in the 
Supreme Court's new opinion that is inconsistent with our decision here.  To the extent that we have relied on the Second 
Circuit's opinion in Eisen, the Supreme Court's affirmance of that decision strengthens our own. "

496,1," This is a question of first impression for this court.  The issue was presented as to a county in Security Fire Door Company v. 
County of Los Angeles, 484 F.2d 1028 (9th Cir. 1973), but the case was decided on other grounds, see id. at 1030 n. 2."
496,2," Section 1 of the Sherman Act, as amended, [15 U.S.C. § 1] provides in relevant part: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. . . .  Every person who shall make any contract or engage in 
any combination or conspiracy declared by sections 1 to 7 of this title to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, 
and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding fifty thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding 
one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court. Excepting two provisos, not here relevant and deleted from the above quotation, and an increase in the magnitude of the fine, 
the language of 15 U.S.C. § 1 is substantially the same as when originally enacted. See 26 Stat. 209, ch. 647 § 1 (1890). Section 2 of the Sherman Act, as amended, [15 U.S.C. § 2] provides: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, whall be deemed guilty of

imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court. Except for an increase in the magnitude of the fine, 15 U.S.C. § 2 is identical to the original enactment.  See 26 Stat. 209, ch. 
647, § 2 (1890)."
496,3," Shell seeks treble damages, costs and attorneys' fees along with injunctive relief. Section 4 of the Clayton Act, as amended [15 
U.S.C. § 15] provides: Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue 
therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, 
without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of 
suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. This language has not been altered since its original enactment.  See 38 Stat. 731, ch. 323, § 4.  It is similar to section 7 of the 
Sherman Act [26 Stat. 210, ch. 647, § 7] (1890), now repealed. "
497,," Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by any other person or corporation by reason of anything 
forbidden or declared to be unlawful by this act, may sue therefor in any circuit court of the United States in the district in 
which the defendant resides or is found, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the 
damages by him sustained, and the costs of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. We note that Section 4 of the Clayton Act omits the language ""by any other person or corporation"" used in Section 7 of the 
Sherman Act. The omission might give rise to the inference that injuries need no longer be caused by ""persons."" The difference 
in language, however, seems to be without relevance.  The Senate report on the bill repealing Section 7 of the Sherman Act 
indicates that the purpose of Section 4 of the Clayton Act was to provide a private remedy for violations of all ""antitrust laws,"" not 
just violations of the Sherman Act. Sen. Rep. No. 619, June 21, 1955, H.R. 4954, 1955 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News, 2328.  
No significance was given to the fact that Section 4 of the Clayton Act omits the phrase ""by any other person."" In addition, in 
Georgia v. Evans, 316 U.S. 159, 86 L. Ed. 1346, 62 S. Ct. 972 (1942), the Court analyzed section 7 of the Sherman Act, which 
was still in force, without any mention of the different language used in section 4 of the Clayton Act. Indeed, Justice Roberts, 
dissenting, relied on the very phrase that is missing from section 4 of the Clayton Act. 316 U.S. at 163. Had the difference been 
significant, analysis under section 7 would not have ended the inquiry for Justice Roberts. Regarding injunctive relief, 15 U.S.C. § 26 provides in relevant part: Any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of the United 
States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of antitrust laws. . . ."
497,4, An identical definition is found in section 1 of the Clayton Act [15 U.S.C. § 12]. 
498,5," Nor is there any indication that either section 4 or section 16 of the Clayton Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 15, 26] was intended to expand 
the scope of regulated conduct under sections 1 and 2.  They merely provided additional remedies for conduct prohibited 
elsewhere in the Acts. "
499,6," Since we hold that Shell's claim does not state a cause of action under the Sherman Act, we need not consider the question 
whether the fact that Shell's complaint is a counterclaim circumvents the proscription of the Eleventh Amendment. Nor does the 
analysis depend upon a holding, and therefore we do not hold, that the Eleventh Amendment would bar a suit for treble 
damages against a state under the Sherman Act. The point is that the Eleventh Amendment raises such serious questions 
concerning such a suit that it is unlikely that Congress had a futile intent to apply the Sherman Act to the states.  And even if a 
counterclaim would not be barred, it is unlikely that Congress intended to apply the Sherman Act to the states merely to cover 
the counterclaim situation.  It should be noted in this regard that, as originally enacted, the Sherman Act provided for no private 
injunctive relief. And there is no indication that including private injunctive relief in Section 16 of the Clayton Act [15 U.S.C. § 26] 
expanded the substantive scope of the Sherman Act."
499,7," The difficulty of applying the third remedy, forfeiture of property under section 6 of the Sherman Act [15 U.S.C. § 6], seems no 
more benign than those mentioned in connection with treble damages and criminal sanctions."
499,8," This conclusion is not necessarily contrary to the policies one might discern in the antitrust laws. It is true that the Sherman Act 
was intended to protect competition, see Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 492-93 & n. 15, 84 L. Ed. 1311, 60 S. Ct. 
982 (1940). But the problem presented by the trusts of 1890 was not only that they prevented competition detrimentally to 
consumers, but also that they were, in a laissez-faire economy, able to do so unchecked by popular control of any type.  While 
states might act anti-competitively, they do not do so unchecked by popular control.  Thus, it is possible to conclude that the 
Sherman Act was aimed at controlling anti-competitive elements where there was no available remedy rather than at controlling 
all possible anti-competitive entities, including states.  Of course, this is not the only reasonable interpretation of the Sherman 
Act's policies, but is a reasonable one which at least shields our holding from the claim that it is inconsistent with any reasonable 
purpose Congress could have had in mind. We also note that where a state's activities affect the economy of another state, to whose citizens it is not responsible politically, 
the activity must be carried out within the confines of the Interstate Commerce clause. "
500,9," For example: [The marketing program] derived its authority and its efficacy from the legislative command of the state and was not 
intended to operate or become effective without that command.  (317 U.S. at 350, emphasis added). We find nothing in the language of the Sherman Act or in its history which suggests that its purpose was to restrain a state 
or its officers or agents from activities directed by its legislature.  Id. at 350-351 (emphasis added). The state itself exercises its legislative authority in making the regulation and in prescribing the conditions of its application.  Id. at 352 (emphasis added)."
500,10," Since we reject Shell's argument, we need not consider whether New Mexico's legislature has mandated anti-competitive 
purchases of asphalt to replace competition among inferior public bodies."
500,11," One set of such cases should be separated from the others at the outset.  In Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr 
Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523 (1961), and United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 
14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585 (1965), the Court held that joint efforts to influence public officials in the passage of laws are 
beyond the scope of the antitrust laws. Noerr cited Parker, 365 U.S. at 137, N. 17, and both Parker and Noerr-Pennington deal 
with what might be termed ""state-action"" immunity. But by imputing the ""legislative"" limitation of Noerr-Pennington to Parker, 
Shell loses sight of the fact that they are two separate doctrines. See, e.g., George R. Whitten, Inc. v. Paddock Pool Builders, 
Inc., 424 F.2d 25 (1st Cir. 1970), where Parker and Noerr-Pennington immunity are discussed separately.  The case before us 
has none of the elements of a Noerr-Pennington case, and the Noerr-Pennington doctrine is inapplicable."
500,12," See also Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 706, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777, 82 S. Ct. 1404 (1962), 
""[Parker] sustained the validity of mandatory state or federal governmental regulations. . . .""; Consolidated Gas Electric Light & 
Power Co. of Baltimore v. Pennsylvania Water & Power, 194 F.2d 89, 99 (4th Cir. 1952), ""[Parker involved] the right of the State 
of California to regulate and control the production of agricultural products within the state""; Morton v. National Dairy Products 
Corp., 287 F. Supp. 753, 763 (E.D. Pa. 1968). ""[Parker holds that] activity imposed by a state on sellers through legislation . . . is 
state activity ' beyond the reach of the antitrust laws""; and North Little Rock Transportation Co., Inc. v. Casualty Reciprocal 
Exchange, 85 F. Supp. 961, 964 (E.D. Ark. 1949), ""The Sherman Act is not violated by acts authorized and regulated by state 
statute"".  In Wainwright v. National Dairy Products Corp., 304 F. Supp. 567 (N.D. Ga. 1969), the Court found the existence of 
""state action"" by finding: ""In short, the state's hand ran throughout the statutory scheme"" ( Id. at 574). "
501,13," See, e.g., Travelers Insurance Co. v. Blue Cross of Western Penn., 298 F. Supp. 1109 (W.D. Pa. 1969)."
501,14," See, e.g., Wiggins Airways, Inc. v. Massachusetts Port Authority, 362 F.2d 52 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 947, 17 L. Ed. 
2d 226, 87 S. Ct. 320; (1966) Ladue Local Lines, Inc. v. The Bi-State Development Agency of the Missouri-Illinois Metropolitan 
District, 433 F.2d 131 (8th Cir. 1970)."
501,15, Nor can there be any valid argument that a county is really a private party masquerading under the umbrella of state authority. 
502,16," Any other reading of Parker would make the ""legislative mandate"" discussion inconsistent with the earlier statement that the 
Sherman Act is inapplicable to the states. It is true that the defendant was clearly a state officer in Parker.  But the plaintiff was not asserting that the Director of Agriculture 
was liable: he was arguing that the Director could not enforce his regulations requiring admittedly private parties to act anti-
competitively.  It is far different to conclude that a state official, not acting under the mandate of a legislative regulatory scheme, 
can be enjoined from forcing private parties to act anti-competitively than to conclude that the official or the state for whom he 
acts is itself liable for a violation of the Sherman Act. The former is merely a Supremacy Clause question. "
503,17," This distinction is not without significance, since the federalism obstacles to state antitrust liability discussed above are 
inapplicable.  The central issue in Hecht was whether Congress, in granting authority to the Armory Board to operate Robert F. 
Kennedy Stadium, authorized a mode of operation inconsistent with the antitrust laws. See 444 F.2d at 935, 938, 942-47. Since 
Congress had enacted both the antitrust laws and the legislation concerning the stadium, and since the former preceded the 
latter both chronologically and in order of national importance, the court began with the premise that the antitrust laws applied to 
the operation of the stadium absent ""a definite clearly expressed, specific intent of Congress"" to the contrary.  Id. at 947. A 
different premise underlies the question of the applicability of the antitrust laws to state action. As stated in Parker, ""in a dual 
system of government in which, under the Constitution, the states are sovereign save only as Congress may constitutionally 
subtract from their authority, an unexpressed purpose to nullify a state's control over its officers and agents is not lightly to be 
attributed to Congress."" 317 U.S. at 351."
503,18," The issue is more properly framed as one involving the applicability of the Sherman Act to the states rather than a state's 
immunity from the Act."
503,19," We note that we are faced only with an antitrust claim directly against the state.  We express no opinion on the liability of 
private parties who conspire with a state in restraint of trade.  Nor do we imply that a state cannot be enjoined from forcing 
private parties to violate the antitrust laws where the requirements of Parker are not met. In addition, we express no view concerning the circumstances in which state agents, officers, and employees acting in their 
official capacities are subject to the Sherman Act. Cf., e.g., Rangen, Inc. v. Sterling Nelson & Sons, 351 F.2d 851, 858-59 (9th 
Cir. 1965). Since we have concluded that states are not regulated by sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, we need not consider whether 
sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act afford Shell the remedies it seeks. "
510,1," Most of the moving defendants raised each of these issues.  A few, however, questioned only the Court's jurisdiction over their 
persons.  Because the personal jurisdiction defense is most important and was raised by each of the movants, it will serve no 
useful purpose to detail precisely which defenses were raised by which defendant.  It suffices to note that this opinion will deal 
with pre-answer motions or requests for preliminary hearings by the following defendants: William Teacher & Sons, Ltd.; James 
Burrough, Ltd.; John Jameson & Sons, Ltd.; C.D.C. (S.A.); Justerini & Brooks; Ste. Marnier-Lapostolle; Berry Bros & Rudd; 
Drambuie Liqueur Co., Ltd.; Peter F. Heering; Noilly Prat & Co.; J & F Martell; Jean Patou (S.A.); Guerlain, S.A. and Guerlain, 
Inc.  Although motions were filed by Chanel, Inc. and Chanel (S.A.) these motions were not argued and plaintiff has stated that 
the case against them is in the process of being settled.  Plaintiff's Memorandum, p. 2 n. 7.  Therefore, they will not be decided 
at this time, but may be heard in the event that settlement negotiations terminate."
510,2," No answers were received from defendants Patou and Jameson.  William Teacher & Sons, Ltd. responded to the wrong 
interrogatories presumably by mistake."
510,3," Although I will give some individual consideration to each of these questions, it is my view that the three are quite inter-related.  
Some issues in the case are relevant both to a resolution of the sufficiency of process and the in personam jurisdiction motions.  
However, for reasons which will be explained herein, the inquiry into this Court's personal jurisdiction will be most significant and 
will occupy the greatest part of my attention."
510,4," In addition to the Virgin Islands long arm statute which provides the basis for plaintiff's argument that personal jurisdiction over 
all defendants, 5 V.I.C. § 4903, and service on non-corporate defendants, 5 V.I.C. § 4904, is proper, plaintiff also relies on 15 "
511,," U.S.C. § 22 as an alternative foundation for venue and for service on corporate defendants.  Each of these statutes will be 
considered by the Court as if they had been alleged in plaintiff's complaint."
511,5," The same argument advanced by defendant Heering might well apply to defendants Martell & Co. and Noilly Prat & Co. if their 
status as partnerships is accepted by plaintiffs or sustained by the Court."
511,6," Defendant also relies on similar specificity noted in 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332(d); 1451.  Furthermore it points to Rule 81(c)'s 
discussion of removal from ""state"" courts to United States district courts as an indication that the Virgin Islands is not included 
within the term ""state."" Otherwise, it is argued, a rule which applies to this court would be meaningless, since an action cannot 
be removed from a court to the same court.  However, Rule 81(c) is clearly inapplicable and unnecessary in the Virgin Islands 
and its terminology cannot be used to define sections which do apply and have meaning here.  The inapplicability of Rule 81(c) 
is suggested by the presence of a specific section of the Revised Organic Act (§ 22) governing transfer of actions from the lower 
courts to this Court and by the fact that this Court is not a ""United States"" district court, a term of art having historical significance 
as denoting the constitutional courts created under Article III.  Mookini v. United States, 303 U.S. 201, 205 (1938). See, e.g., 
Government v. Bell, 392 F.2d 207 (3d Cir. 1968); Ferguson v. Kwik-Check, Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., 7 V.I. 639 (D.V.I. 1970); 
Callwood v. Callwood, 127 F. Supp. 179 (D.V.I. 1954)."
511,7," The argument that Congress already limited the process of the Virgin Islands District Court in the first Organic Act, 48 U.S.C. § 
1405(2), is unpersuasive.  By providing that the process of the District Court ""shall run throughout the Virgin Islands,"" Congress 
was merely stating that, although there were three major islands and many smaller islands, islets and cays, service could be 
made on any one of the islands, islets and cays within two defined jurisdictional divisions, i.e., the ""Division of St. Thomas and 
St. John"" and the ""Division of St. Croix."" "
512,8," HN9[
] Section 12 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 22, also provides that ""process may be served in the district of which [a corporation] is an inhabitant, or wherever it may be found."" Although defendants argue that service under Section 12 must be 
made in some district, I think the better view is that the language ""wherever found"" contemplates service in foreign countries.  
Hoffman Motors Corp. v. Alfa Romeo Spa, 244 F. Supp. 70, 79 (S.D.N.Y. 1965). Given this interpretation, service by mail would 
be authorized by Section 12 through Rules 4(e) and (i) (1) (D)."
512,9," This is appropriate because the statutory question of venue is merely one of convenience whereas the issue of personal 
jurisdiction involves a question of constitutional significance - whether due process is violated by forcing a defendant to litigate in 
a specified district. "
514,10," The only contracts involved in this case are those whereby the foreign supplier-defendants agree to sell exclusively to certain 
local defendants. "
515,11," Although plaintiffs refer to § 4903(a) (3), its requirement of an act or omission in this territory by the defendant is unlikely to be 
satisfied.I am unwilling to adopt a tortured construction of the section in order to fit this case within it. "
517,12," Because the defendants have not supplied information about the dollar value of their sales, I cannot decide their motions at 
this time.  It is obvious from my treatment of defendant Prat that some lines can be drawn to separate defendants making 
negligible sales from those making substantial ones.  But such line drawing is difficult enough, and easily subject to criticism 
alone, without having to contend with such deficiencies in information."
517,13," I do not feel that the layers of agents which these defendants use to distribute their products can conclusively settle the 
question of their contacts with the jurisdiction.  Guerlain, Inc. does not sell to the Virgin Islands but has made minor shipments 
and has sent an employee (who also works for Western Hemisphere) here.  Drambuie and Patou do not reveal the extent to 
which they control or direct their agents for distribution.  Therefore, until these business relationships are further clarified I cannot 
conclude that the minimum contacts necessary to support in personam jurisdiction are lacking.  To conclude that the layers of 
agents, on their face, insulate the defendants from suit would invite establishment of complicated distributorship arrangements, 
merely to avoid contacts with the United States and its antitrust laws.  Moreover, if further answers to interrogatories are 
forthcoming, it may be that some of these defendants may establish that their sales here are de minimus."
517,14," My holding that the tortious injury section of the Virgin Islands long arm statute does apply to an antitrust action makes the 
liberal tortious injury personal jurisdiction cases (such as Gray v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Corp., 22 Ill. 2d 432, 
176 N.E.2d 761 (1961)), more relevant to the jurisdictional questions raised here.  I do not consider these cases to be merely a "
518,," reflection of the growth of products liability law.  Rather, I think the policies upon which they are based are ones of generaal 
applicability to cases where tortious injury is caused in a state by the actions of a defendant in another jurisdiction."
518,15," Cause of action motions were made by defendants J & B and Drambuie.  J & B argued its motion at the hearing on the 
personal jurisdiction motions; counsel for Drambuie was unable to attend, but submitted the motion on his extensive brief. "

556,9," In the instant case, the plaintiff should not be penalized in his recovery of damages, if he can show liability, because he took 
action, the sale of his service station, which tended to mitigate his damages. "
557,10," The dialogue in appellant's deposition states: ""Q.  So you decided then to get out? A.  Correct. Q.  And you made a deal with your brother? A.  Right. Q.  Did your brother buy all your stock and equipment from you? A.  Yes, sir. Q.  Did he pay you a fair price for it? A.  Yes, sir. Q.  You don't have any complaint about the price you got for your stock and equipment? A.  No, sir. Q.  You realized full value for your stock and equipment? A.  Yes, sir, by selling it. Q.  By selling it? A.  Yes, sir. Q.  You didn't lose any money by selling your stock and equipment to your brother? A.  No, sir. Q.  Gulf didn't have anything to do with it, you all made the trade by yourself? A.  No, we didn't make a trade, I offered it to him at a certain price, and he accepted it, and we -- Q.  Well, you made a trade, you said, 'all right, I'll sell it at this price,' and he said, 'O.K., I'll buy it from you.'? A.  Correct. Q.  Whatever the price was, you were both satisfied? A.  Right. Q.  Did you have any good will connected with the station? A.  What do you mean by good will? Q.  I don't know, whatever good will is, do you know what good will is? A.  Well, good will consists of -- anything you want it to consist of, I guess. Q.  Well, did you have any connected with the station? A.  No, sir, I sold the station for exactly what I give for it, so I don't guess there was any good will. "
558,," Q.  All right, sir, so you sold it for what you thought was a fair value? A.  Right."""
558,11," Of course in determining the fair market value, whether by capitalizing and discounting future profits or estimating loss of good 
will and the value of the service station equipment, the $10,000 received will necessarily have to be set off."
558,12," This provision states: ""HN9[
] When a district judge, in making in a civil action an order not otherwise appealable under this section, shall be of 
the opinion that such order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of 
opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation, he 
shall so state in writing in such order. The Court of Appeals may thereupon, in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken 
from such order, if application is made to it within ten days after the entry of the order: Provided, however, That application 
for an appeal hereunder shall not stay proceedings in the district court unless the district judge or the Court of Appeals or a 
judge thereof shall so order."" "
561,*," If plaintiffs were in fact representing the buyers rather than the sellers in this brokerage arrangement, Amstar insists that its 
continuing to pay commissions would violate § 2(c) of the Clayton Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13 (c).  That section provides: HN3[
] ""That it shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, to pay or grant, 
or to receive or accept, anything of value as a commission, brokerage, or other compensation, or any allowance or discount "
562,," in lieu thereof, except for services rendered in connection with the sale or purchase of goods, wares, or merchandise, either 
to the other party to such transaction or to an agent, representative, or other intermediary therein where such intermediary 
is acting in fact for or in behalf or is subject to the direct or indirect control, of any party to such transaction other than the 
person by who such compensation is so granted or paid."" "
566,1," Plaintiff also asserts a cause of action under the Illinois Antitrust Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, § 60-1 et seq.  A claim for punitive 
damages has previously been ordered stricken from the amended complaint. "
567,2," In some paragraphs of the amended complaint, plaintiff claims that he and the purported class are forced to purchase all of 
their requirements of the designated products from defendants or their designated sources, while, in other paragraphs, the 
coercion is alleged to be directed at limiting purchases to defendants alone."
567,3, None of the other 44 area franchisees is a party to this litigation. 
568,4, These royalties are divided between Tastee-Freez and the franchisees.
568,5," The aforementioned affiant also states that the franchisee in Georgia has used a modified version of a Coca-Cola form contract 
as the standard license agreement in his territory."
568,6," The provision in its entirety reads as follows: ""That to secure the uniformity essential in the operation of Tastee-Freez Establishment, he shall purchase all supplies, food 
products and equipment from such supplier or suppliers as Franchisee may in writing designate; provided, however, that if 
he can secure equivalent supplies, food products or equipment conforming to the specifications now or hereafter 
established by Harlee from other than the designated supplier or suppliers, he shall not be obligated to purchase said 
supplies, food products or equipment from said designated supplier or suppliers."""
568,7," That provision in its entirety reads as follows: "". . . . to insure the uniformity in quality to the public of said products, Lessee shall use only Tastee-Freez Mix in the 
aforesaid Feeders, or such other mix of similar ingredients and quality to Tastee-Freez Mix as shall be first approved in 
writing by Lessor. "" ""To use only supplies, including but not limited to, Flavors, Sundae Toppings, Cones, Spoons, all sizes of Containers, 
Straws, Uniforms, Caps and Signs that are first approved in writing by Lessor."""
568,8," The provision in its entirety reads as follows: ""That to secure the uniformity essential in the operation of the Tastee-Freez Establishment, to protect the secrecy of the 
Tastee-Freez formula and to insure that the standards of the quality associated with the Tastee-Freez trademark are met by 
Licensee, he shall purchase only from Franchisee or a source designated by Franchisee: (i) all of his requirements of 
Tastee-Freez mix; (ii) supplies used in and incidental to the preparation and sale of Tastee-Freez, including but not limited 
to toppings, fountain supplies, paper and plastic containers and utensils; (iii) all foods and related items used in the 
preparation and sale of Tastee-Freez Products."" "
570,9," Although plaintiff charges that Chicago TF coerced its licensees into purchasing supplies from unwanted sources, plaintiff's 
deposition testimony and the statement of another Chicago TF operator show that these persons bought numerous items from 
suppliers not designated or recommended by defendant; that plaintiff freely chose to buy other supplies from the recommended 
companies and made no attempt to purchase these provisions from alternate sources.  By reciting this evidence, the court does 
not intend by any means to prejudge, or to indicate any orientation toward, the merits of this case. "
571,10," Plaintiff also contends that the common question also is found in his allegation that the licensing agreements are substantially 
similar and constitute illegal tying arrangements.  This argument is without merit, as previously discussed in the text."
571,11," Interestingly, the Seligson and McMackin decisions cited in the text overruled prior opinions in the same cases by the same 
judges tentatively certifying a class action. See Seligson v. Plum Tree, Inc., 55 F.R.D. 259 (E.D. Pa. 1972); McMackin v. 
Schwinn Bicycle Co., 1972 CCH TRADE CASES para. 74,220 (N.D. Ill. 1972). "
572,12," Although plaintiff does seek injunctive relief, this, presumably, is attributable to his inclusion of present licensees in the 
purported class. The existing licensees' interest in the continued financial strength of the defendants overcomes plaintiff's argument that, because 
of the consent decree entered into by the Federal Trade Commission, Tastee-Freez, and several area franchisees, not including 
Chicago TF, see Consent Order, FTC File No. 701-0079 (December 22, 1972), both present and former licensees would be 
interested primarily in damages."
572,13," Although Rule 23(a) (3) has not been specifically discussed here, the court in Gaines also noted that the named plaintiffs' 
status as a former franchisee also disqualified them under that provision.  1972 Trade Cas. (CCH) P 73,860, at 91,605. "
587,1," More fully, his explanation was: ""In all our experience in dealing with fibrillated material, we found that it was necessary in order 
to form a sound molding to hold the material under compression during the sintering or it would pull itself apart as had these 
moldings here.  This is, I believe, a consequence of the elastic retraction of the fibrils when they are heated above their melting 
temperature.  This elastic retraction just makes them pull themselves apart when one is sintered."" (Tr. 80)."
587,2," Patent No. 2,936,301 was issued to Thomas and Wallace on May 10, 1960 upon an application filed November 15, 1956.  (DX 
26)."
587,3," Testifying for the defendant, Dr. Lontz stated that he did not fully subscribe to this statement by Thomas and Wallace and he 
questioned whether it was generally accepted at DuPont.  (Tr. 1503).  In light of the facts that Dr. Lontz was personally involved 
in preparing the specifications and tests for the Thomas and Wallace invention (Tr. 1238) and was the supervisor of Thomas at 
the time of the patent application (Tr. 1505) but did not voice any contemporaneous objection to the Thomas and Wallace 
statement, this testimony by Dr. Lontz is entitled to limited weight. "
589,4," According to the testimony of Nathan Marmelstein, the Board of Appeals member who authored the opinion granting the 292 
patent, the Board would not, as a matter of practice, examine a patent referred to during the prosecution before the Examiner 
but not raised on the appeal by either the applicant or the Examiner.  (Tr. 1724-1726).  Wilbert Gore admitted that the Richards 
patent was not discussed in the oral argument before the Board.  (Tr. 1774-1776).  Moreover, the fact that no reference to 
Richards appears in the opinion of the Board supports an inference that the patent was not considered by the Board.  (Tr. 1299-
1300)."
589,5," See 1 Horowitz, Patent Office Rules and Practice § 104 (1971 ed.). "
590,6," Only claims 1 and 7 of the first ten claims are independent claims.  Claim 1 is broader in scope than claim 7 and is, therefore, 
infringed by any process that would infringe claim 7.  Claim 7 is quoted at pages 6-7, supra."
590,7," Claim 11 states: ""A process for coating, in a continuous manner, an article which comprises passing along their longitudinal 
axes at least two surfaces of a coating material derived from an unsintered tetrafluoroethylene polymer and in sheet form to and 
through the nip of two pressure rolls containing recesses separated by ridges, the said sheets and the said rolls being at 
temperatures below the sintering temperature of the said polymer; simultaneously passing the article to be coated to and 
through the resultant nip being formed by the said sheets and aligned to pass through respective recesses; exerting pressure on 
the said coating material to enclose the said article in said material and to press the said sheets together, when and where they 
contact each other under pressure in said passage over said ridges, to a thickness less than the sum of their initial thicknesses 
to bond the said sheets together in the form of a web which has the said lesser thickness, which contains unsintered polymer 
and which extends longitudinally along the length of the resultant enclosed article and transversely away from it; and 
withdrawing from the exit side of said rolls the resultant assembly which comprises the said article coated with polymer that is 
unsintered and the said web."""
590,8," Claim 24, upon which claims 25-27 are dependent, reads: ""As an article of manufacture, an electrical conductor coated with a 
tetrafluoroethylene polymer which is in an unsintered form and is bonded by a weld extending longitudinally along the length of "
591,," said conductor and transversely away from it, said weld comprising at least two overlapped sheets of said polymer compressed 
to a thickness less than the sum of the initial thicknesses of the elements in the overlap, the said initial thickness of a sheet 
being measured by the thickness of the coating derived from the respective sheet."""
591,9," The statute provides in part: ""When the damages are not found by a jury, the court shall assess them.  In either event the court 
may increase the damages up to three times the amount found or assessed."""
591,10," This Court's colloquy with John Fay is instructive: THE COURT: When was the first time you ever saw the '292 patent? THE WITNESS: The first time -- I don't remember, but we did get some correspondence out of the file which placed it in the early 
part of 1970. THE COURT: You mean when you were getting all these specifications and you were learning that Gore was making something 
that you were interested in, furnishing it to people that you were trying to furnish the same material for, you mean to tell me that 
you didn't bother to look to see whether Gore had any patents which you might be infringing? "
592,," THE WITNESS: No, sir, we didn't.  (Tr. 644-645). Moreover, Heller testified that he first became aware of Gore's flat laminated PTFE cable in the market ""probably"" in the early 
1960's and that it occurred to him at that time that the product might be covered by a patent. (Tr. 771-772). "
596,11," W. L. Gore's summary of the meeting written two days later states: ""As background information, we made the following points:"
596,*, * *
596,2," .  We are now purchasing between $600,000 and $700,000 per year of conductor, most of which is being supplied by 
International Wire, a Division of Carlisle.  We consider that the operative earnings to the Carlisle Corporation as a 
consequence of our purchases are being used to finance the patent infringement and litigation costs by Tensolite, 
therefore, we will seek other suppliers of conductor where the quality, service, and price are approximately the same.  We 
do not wish to continue to supply funds to Carlisle to finance their infringements of our patents."
596,*," * * ""We also pointed out to the Tensolite people that the only way they could win would be by agreeing to a license 
arrangement with us. . . . Further, if Gore shifts its purchases of conductor to competitors of International Wire, Carlisle 
Corporation will suffer a loss of operative earnings that might amount to several hundred thousand dollars per year."" (DX 
48). Surely the statement that a likely cost of continued infringement will be the loss of several hundred thousand dollars worth of 
business constitutes a ""threat"". "
597,12," On remand, the District Court refused to adopt the position that a royalty may be unlawful because of its magnitude, but 
nevertheless found that the royalty in that case was not ""oppressive"".  257 F. Supp. 192 (N.D.Ill.1966). The Court of Appeals 
affirmed.  384 F.2d 813 (7th Cir. 1967)."
597,13," In other words, in economic theory there can be no profits higher than ""monopoly profits"".  If a patentee involved in license 
negotiations demands a royalty higher than that which would generate monopoly profits, the proper inference may be that he 
does not wish to grant a license at all. "
598,14," The only principle for price limitation defendant suggests is that ""the patentee cannot fix a royalty rate at such an amount that 
he would receive a profit in excess of that which he would receive if he manufactured and sold the product himself."" Defendant's 
Main Post-Trial Brief, p. 54.  This suggested principle is unacceptably broad, for it would condemn to a less than maximum 
reward the inventor who lacks the capability to produce the product efficiently, or indeed, at all.  There is no intuitive or 
demonstrated reason for a court to scale the reward for an invention according to the inventor's ability to produce and market it."
598,15," The observation by W. L. Gore at the September 26 meeting that defendant could ""afford"" to pay a high royalty if it raised its 
prices for PTFE flat laminated cable merely stated the obvious.  The record discloses no attempt to solicit an agreement by 
Tensolite to charge higher prices as a condition for receiving or retaining the license."
598,16," Indeed, at oral argument, plaintiff's counsel represented to the Court that although in 1969 90% of Gore's products were based 
on the 292 and 956 patents, by 1972 only 25% of its products were covered by those patents. (Oral Argument, Tr. 86)."
598,17," A patentee's use of purchasing power in another market as a bargaining tool in settlement negotiations in an infringement suit 
could create an inference that the patentee, as well as the infringer, seriously doubted the validity of the patent. Otherwise, a 
patentee might be content to rely on the validity and value of the patent together with concessions on the terms of a license as 
bargaining tools.  However, the record as a whole in this case convincingly demonstrates that plaintiff, with ample cause, 
considered that his patents were valid, taking account of the ""appreciable"" possibility that any patent tested in court may be held 
invalid. "
599,18," Clayton Act § 7, 15 U.S.C. § 18, provides in part: No corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share 
capital and no corporation subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission shall acquire the whole or any part of 
the assets of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where in any line of commerce in any section of the country, 
the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly."
599,19," Sherman Act § 1, 15 U.S.C. § 1, provides in relevant part: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."
599,20," Sherman Act § 2 provides in pertinent part: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of 
a misdemeanor. . . . "
600,21," Although all courts agree that specific intent is a necessary element of an attempted monopolization claim, the circuits differ 
over whether a dangerous probability of market dominance must be shown.  Note, Attempt to Monopolize under the Sherman 
Act: Defendant's Market Power as a Requisite to a Prima Facie Case, 73 Col.L.R. 1451 (1973). However, the ""dangerous 
probability"" requirement seems to have been adopted in several district courts in this Circuit.  Keco Industries, Inc. v. Borg-
Warner Corp., 334 F. Supp. 1240, 1245 (M.D.Pa.1971); Power Replacements Corp. v. Air Preheater Co., 356 F. Supp. 872, 891 
(E.D.Pa.1973). But see Mt. Lebanon Motors, Inc. v. Chrysler Corporation, 283 F. Supp. 453 (W.D.Pa.1968), aff'd 417 F.2d 622 
(3rd Cir. 1969)."
600,22," Of course, if plaintiff had ""monopoly"" power -- a buyer's monopoly -- in the relevant conductor market, use of that power to 
persuade defendant to accept a license in the signal transmission cable market would alone have constituted a § 2 violation, 
without any showing of specific intent or dangerous probability.  United States v. Griffith, 334 U.S. 100, 68 S. Ct. 941, 92 L. Ed. 
1236 (1948). "
601,23," Similarly, Justice Rehnquist, dissenting in United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd., 410 U.S. 52, 93 S. Ct. 861, 35 L. Ed. 2d 104 
(1973), recently pointed out, ""Certainly, it is true, as the Court states, that there is a public interest favoring the judicial testing of 
patent validity and the invalidation of specious patents."" 410 U.S. at 69, 93 S. Ct. at 871. "

608,," different public policies at work in eminent domain and in antitrust suits. Factors which are speculative and appeal to sympathy 
are excluded in eminent domain proceedings to avoid an undue drain on the public treasury. Arguably in the private enforcement 
of our antitrust laws a more liberal test of damages should apply. Id. at n. 80."

Richfield Oil the verdict was for the plaintiff and the defendant appealed. Pending release of this opinion, another panel of this

612,46," Gulf does not abandon the position it took in regard to the instruction: future profit is only relevant as a component of going 
concern value. Gulf continues to maintain that although Lehrman was forced out of a station he had operated for eight years, he 
suffered no damage because the station had enjoyed only meager success, and after its closure he was freed to pursue other 
more profitable enterprises. We feel this contention has been adequately answered by our discussion of the instruction on future 
profits and the previous opinion of this court."
612,47," We clearly stated: ""Particularly is the calculation of damages difficult when the future profits of an enterprise as young as Lehrman's must be 
determined, since there is no reliable track record to look back on. But uncertainty cannot end the efforts of the federal 
courts to redress the harm caused proprietors by violations of the freedom of the marketplace. The wrongdoer must bear 
the risk of the uncertainty in measuring the harm he causes."" 464 F.2d at 45."

from the station on which to base projected profits were expense figures and not the actual gallonage, margin, profit or grades of 
gasoline sold ratios."" (Emphasis in original). Lehrman makes almost identical observations in his brief; the crux of the method 
being profit comparisons. In its reply brief, however, Gulf apparently disavows its former position and vigorously challenges 
Lehrman for implying there was no yardstick and for adopting a ""no name"" theory of damages. Gulf states, ""nothing could be "
613,," farther from the truth. Despite Lehrman's protestations to contrary, the record clearly shows that appellee's evidence of projected 
future net profits was in fact based on a yardstick, Bill Brown's Temple Gulf station."" We do not regard the foregoing semantic 
controversy as the crucial focus in the case. Rather, the inquiry should more appropriately center on whether Lehrman's method 
of proof, regardless of the label attached is ""a just and reasonable estimate of the damage based on relevant data."" Bigelow v.

613,51, The expert's testimony is merely to the effect that the expense data was correlated to arrive at average figures.

seems irrelevant since Gulf's own witness testified that the dealer's margin is the same on all grades."

614,56," The first decision in this case clearly reserved the determination of the duration of future profits to the jury.  464 F.2d at 47. 
Gulf argues that Lehrman's age, health and personal desires are irrelevant under Standard Oil Co. of California v. Moore, 251 
F.2d 188, 219 (9th Cir. 1957). Standard Oil, however, only held these factors irrelevant to going concern value not to the 
duration of future profits."
614,57," Although the verdict was reversed and remanded for a new trial on damages for failure to consider the mitigating factor of 
Lehrman's new earnings, the court addressed one of the specific contentions that Gulf raises here. Gulf also protests the ""speculative"" testimony of Ernest Brown [appellant's expert accountant] and urges us to hold this 
testimony an inadequate basis for assessing Lehrman's damages. But Gulf merely protests application of the familiar rule 
that a wrongdoer is responsible for uncertainty in calculating the damages proximately caused by his own wrongdoing. On 
the facts of the present case, there was evidence from which a jury might conclude that Gulf's decision to punish Lehrman 
by means of its TCA system for failure to abide by Gulf's system of ""suggested"" prices caused the demise of Lehrman's 
station. Once it is apparent that damages must be assessed so as to approximate the future profits of a business, a court 
and jury necessarily enter into the realm of the imprecise and the uncertain. "

Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved. Copies 
of such statement and the comments and views of the appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies, which are authorized 
to develop and enforce environmental standards, shall be made available to the President, the Council on Environmental 
Quality and to the public as provided by section 552 of Title 5, and shall accompany the proposal through the existing

environment, particularly the profound influences of population growth, high-density urbanization, industrial expansion, 
resource exploitation, and new and expanding technological advances and recognizing further the critical importance of 
restoring and maintaining environmental quality to the overall welfare and development of man, declares that it is the 
continuing policy of the Federal Government, in cooperation with State and local governments, and other concerned public 
and private organizations, to use all practicable means and measures, including financial and technical assistance, in a 
manner calculated to foster and promote the general welfare, to create and maintain conditions under which man and 
nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future 
generations of Americans. (b) In order to carry out the policy set forth in this chapter, it is the continuing responsibility of the Federal Government to 
use all practicable means, consistent with other essential considerations of national policy, to improve and coordinate 
Federal plans, functions, programs, and resources to the end that the Nation may -- (1) fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as trustee of the environment for succeeding generations; "
697,," (2) assure for all Americans safe, healthful, productive, and esthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings; (3) attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment without degradation, risk to health or safety, or other 
undesirable and unintended consequences; (4) preserve important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our national heritage, and maintain, wherever possible, an 
environment which supports diversity and variety of individual choice; (5) achieve a balance between population and resource use which will permit high standards of living and a wide sharing of 
life's amenities; and (6) enhance the quality of renewable resources and approach the maximum attainable recycling of depletable resources."

agreement with the FTC's exclusion of its adjudicatory proceedings from the application of NEPA. This is, of course, hearsay 
and would not be proper for consideration at trial or on a motion for summary judgment. Professor Moore, however, states that 
such statements may be considered for whatever they are worth at the preliminary injunction stage of a case. J. Moore, Federal 
Practice (2d ed.), P 65.04[3] at 65-64, 65-65. The Court is inclined to agree but found it unnecessary to base any of its present

711,6," Since preparing the above section of this opinion, the recent case of Response of Carolina v. Leasco Response Incorporated, 
498 F.2d 314 (5th Cir. 1974) has come to our attention.  Though not involving alleged trademark infringement and, thus, factually 
different, it appears philosophically similar to the case under consideration.  We consider antitrust defenses to actions for 
trademark infringement; Judge Tuttle authors an opinion dealing with antitrust defenses to collection suits for goods and services 
sold.  Response of Carolina interprets Bruce's Juices v. American Can Co., 330 U.S. 743, 67 S. Ct. 1015, 91 L. Ed. 1219 (1947), 
and Kelly v. Kosuga, 358 U.S. 516, 79 S. Ct. 429, 3 L. Ed. 2d 475 (1959) in contractual (account) actions much as we view 
Stiftung, supra, in trademark cases and notes Continental Wall Paper Co. v. Lewis Voight & Sons Co., 212 U.S. 227, 29 S. Ct. 
280, 53 L. Ed 486 as our idea of the account suit equivalent of Phi Delta Theta, supra. On reasoning, we feel that Respnse of 
Carolina is recent and compelling authority for this Court's decision here rendered. "
712,7," The statute provides: ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of 
a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding fifty thousand dollars, or by 
imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court."" "
713,8," The counterclaim alleges both an antitrust violation and a claim of unfair competition. In its brief defendant has stated the unfair 
competition claim is based on the common law.  Plaintiff directs its motion only at the antitrust aspects of the counterclaim. "

725,3," At oral argument the Government conceded the validity of DR2-106 itself, which has been adopted and approved by the 
Oregon Supreme Court pursuant to a specific Oregon statute. Neither in briefs nor at argument did either party mention EC2-18, 
which refers to suggested fee schedules. Apparently, the parties recognize that the Ethical Considerations, unlike the 
Disciplinary Rules, are not mandatory in character. "
726,4," One final argument by plaintiff should be mentioned. Plaintiff argues that, even if the Oregon legislature has mandated some 
limitations on competition among attorneys, the defendant must show that its actions constitute the least restrictive alternate 
available to achieve the desired end. In support of this proposition, plaintiff cites Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U.S. 
341, 10 L. Ed. 2d 389, 83 S. Ct. 1246 (1963), a case which reconciled the Securities Exchange Act with the antitrust laws. The 
Court held that the powers of self-regulation granted the Exchange did not give it unbridled immunity from the antitrust laws, but 
only that immunity required to enable the Exchange to achieve the aims of the Securities Exchange Act. Silver does not involve the state action doctrine. Whether the Silver analysis regarding reconciliation of two federal statutory 
schemes should apply to the instant case is an issue this court does not reach since I conclude that the Oregon legislature has 
not directed the defendant to limit fee competition. "

sold bread locally, in competition with Mead's, a firm with bakeries in several States.  Moore alleged that Mead's sold bread in 
his town at a price lower than that which it charged for bread delivered from its in-state plant to customers in an adjoining State.  
The Tenth Circuit held that Mead's activities were essentially local, and that if § 2 (a) applied to them it would exceed Congress' 
commerce power.  The Court (DOUGLAS, J.) unanimously reversed, stating that Congress clearly has power to reach the local 
activities of a firm that finances its predatory practices through multistate operations.  This language, however, spoke to the 
commerce power rather than to jurisdiction under § 2 (a).  In fact, Mead's did have interstate sales and its price discrimination 
thus fell within the literal language of the statute."

judgment procedure, see Brief for Respondents 11-12, nor to the form of the judgment.  Moreover, there is no indication that 
Copp was foreclosed from presenting all available evidence concerning the interstate commerce issues, at least as to §§ 3 and 
7.  Cf.  McBeath v. Inter-American Citizens for Decency Comm., 374 F.2d 359, 363 (CA5 1967). In any event, assuming that the 
interstate commerce requirements of §§ 3 and 7 are properly deemed issues of subject-matter jurisdiction, rather than simply 
necessary elements of the federal claims, cf., e. g., United States v. Employing Plasterers Assn., 347 U.S. 186 (1954);

299 (2d ed. 1974), there is, as the dissenting opinion by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS notes, an identity between the ""jurisdictional"" 
issues and certain issues on the merits, and hence, under Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731 (1947), no objection to reserving the 
jurisdictional issues until a hearing on the merits.  By the same token, however, there is no objection to use, in appropriate 
cases, of summary judgment procedure to determine whether there is a genuine issue of material fact as to the interstate 
commerce elements. "
781,1," 38 Stat. 731, 15 U. S. C. § 17. See H. R. Rep. No. 627, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., 14-16 (1914); United States v. Hutcheson, 312 
U.S. 219 (1941)."
781,2," 15 U. S. C. § 18; H. R. Rep. No. 627, supra, at 17.  See also United States v. Penn-Olin Chemical Co., 378 U.S. 158, 170-171 
(1964); United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 353 U.S. 586, 597 (1957)."
781,3," The definition of ""antitrust laws"" as used in the Clayton Act includes the Sherman Act. 15 U. S. C. § 12. The definition of 
""commerce"" was actually ""broadened so as to include trade and commerce between any insular possessions or other places 
under the jurisdiction of the United States, which at present do not come within the scope of the Sherman antitrust law or other 
laws relating to trusts."" H. R. Rep. No. 627, supra, at 7. The Sherman Act declares illegal every contract, combination, or conspiracy ""in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States . . . ."" 15 U. S. C. § 1. It also makes a misdemeanor a monopoly of ""any part of the trade or commerce among the 
several States . . . ."" 15 U. S. C. § 2."
781,4," ""Commerce"" as used in the Clayton Act is defined in § 1 as follows: ""'Commerce,' as used herein, means trade or commerce among the several States and with foreign nations, or between the 
District of Columbia or any Territory of the United States and any State, Territory, or foreign nation, or between any insular 
possessions or other places under the jurisdiction of the United States, or between any such possession or place and any State 
or Territory of the United States or the District of Columbia or any foreign nation, or within the District of Columbia or any 
Territory or any insular possession or other place under the jurisdiction of the United States."" 15 U. S. C. § 12. "
782,5," Indeed, we would have to sit as a Committee of Revision over Congress, shaping the law to fit our prejudices against antitrust 
regulations, to hold that ""in commerce"" as used in the Clayton Act was intended to provide less comprehensive coverage than 
the language of the Sherman Act. Prior to passage of the Clayton Act, labor union practices had been held by this Court to affect 
commerce and thus to fall within the reach of the Sherman Act, despite the fact that the union activities could not be regarded as 
being in the flow of commerce. Loewe v. Lawlor, 208 U.S. 274, 300-301 (1908). See also Teamsters Local 167 v. United States, 
291 U.S. 293, 297 (1934); Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469 (1940); United States v. Employing Plasterers Assn., 347 
U.S. 186, 189 (1954). If the Court is right today in saying that ""in commerce"" as used in the Clayton Act is to be read more 
restrictively than the Sherman Act, then those who drafted the Clayton Act (including Louis D. Brandeis) to protect labor were 
needlessly concerned -- no express exemption of labor would have been necessary, since the ""in commerce"" language of the 
Clayton Act (if narrowly read) would not have supported judicial attempts to reach labor activities on an ""affecting commerce"" 
theory.  The drafters obviously thought otherwise."
782,6," The decision of the Court of Appeals on the Sherman Act issue, which remains intact by virtue of our limited grant of certiorari, 
held that petitioners and their alleged activities were sufficiently ""in commerce"" to support Sherman Act jurisdiction.  487 F.2d 
202, 205 (1973). The majority now holds, however, that petitioners and their alleged activities were not sufficiently ""in 
commerce"" to support Clayton and Robinson-Patman Act coverage.  In light of the latter holding, it is difficult to imagine the 
reception that Copp's Sherman Act claims will receive on remand. "
783,7," Of course, in a limited range of Sherman Act cases, this Court has held that certain practices are per se violations of the 
antitrust laws; that is to say, these practices are conclusively presumed to be illegal without the need for any particularized 
inquiry into their effects.  See generally White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 259-262 (1963), and cases collected 
therein.  These cases may be viewed as limited exceptions to the individualized approach described in the text above. "
784,8," Federal Rule Civ. Proc. 56 ""deals with the merits"" of a claim and if in favor of the defendant is ""in bar and not in abatement,"" 6 
J. Moore, Federal Practice para. 56.03, p. 2051 (2d ed. 1974).  Lack of jurisdiction of the court is a matter in abatement and thus 
is not usually appropriate for a summary judgment, which is not a substitute for a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction.  Id., 
at 2052-2053. On the general propriety of discovery orders of this sort, see 4 id., para. 26.56 [6]; but ""[there] are cases . . . in which the 
jurisdictional questions are so intertwined with the merits that the court might prefer to reserve judgment on the jurisdiction until 
after discovery has been completed."" Id., at 26-191.  See also the discussion in n. 10, infra."
784,9," The issue of whether there is subject-matter jurisdiction raises the question whether the complaint, on its face, asserts a 
nonfrivolous claim ""arising under"" federal law.  Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 199-200 (1962); Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 682-
683 (1946). If such a claim is stated, the District Court is then empowered to assume jurisdiction and to determine whether the 
claim is good or bad, on the basis of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim or cause of action.  Romero v. International 
Terminal Operating Co., 358 U.S. 354, 359 (1959); Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. v. Northwestern Public Service Co., 341 U.S. 
246, 249 (1951). Such a dismissal is on the merits, not for want of jurisdiction.  Bell v. Hood, supra."
784,10," It is sometimes said that where the district court's jurisdiction is challenged, that court has the power, either on its own motion 
or on motion of a party, to inquire into the facts as they exist for purposes of resolving the jurisdictional issue. Land v. Dollar, 330 
U.S. 731, 735 n. 4 (1947), and cases cited; Local 336, American Federation of Musicians v. Bonatz, 475 F.2d 433, 437 (CA3 
1973). On the other hand, if the jurisdictional issue is closely intertwined with or dependent on the merits of the case, the 
preferred procedure is to proceed to a determination of the case on the merits.  McBeath v. Inter-American Citizens for Decency 
Comm., 374 F.2d 359, 362-363 (CA5), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 896 (1967); Jaconski v. Avisun Corp., 359 F.2d 931, 935-936 (CA3 
1966). The cases cited for the proposition that a district court may inquire into jurisdictional facts on a motion to dismiss for want of 
jurisdiction are cases in which the jurisdictional issue was whether the plaintiff met the amount-in-controversy requirement.  That 
jurisdictional issue is sufficiently independent of the merits of the claim to warrant independent examination, if challenged.  
Where the jurisdictional issue is more closely linked to the merits, disposition of the jurisdictional issue on motion becomes 
inappropriate.  Thus in Land v. Dollar, where the complaint alleged that members of the United States Maritime Commission 
were unlawfully holding shares of Dollar stock under a claim that the stock belonged to the United States, the District Court 
dismissed on the ground that the suit was against the United States.  In affirming a reversal of that dismissal, the Court said: 
""[Although] as a general rule the District Court would have authority to consider questions of jurisdiction on the basis of affidavits 
as well as the pleadings, this is the type of case where the question of jurisdiction is dependent on decision of the merits."" 330 
U.S., at 735. This was true because if the plaintiffs prevailed on either of their theories on the merits (that the Commission was 
without authority to acquire the shares, or that the contract was simply a pledge of the shares rather than an outright transfer), "
785,," then they would also prevail on the jurisdictional issue. And in the McBeath case, supra, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit 
reversed a pretrial dismissal of a Sherman Act claim on grounds of lack of jurisdiction (for failure to show an effect on interstate 
commerce).  Relying on Land v. Dollar, it held that the issue of effects on interstate commerce was so intertwined with the merits 
of the claim that it was error for the District Court to dismiss without giving the plaintiff a full chance to prove his case on the 
merits. In cases such as United States v. Employing Plasterers Assn., 347 U.S. 186 (1954); Mandeville Island Farms v. American 
Crystal Sugar Co., 334 U.S. 219 (1948); and United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U.S. 218 (1947), this Court has reviewed 
""interstate commerce"" issues in the context of dismissals of antitrust suits prior to trial on the merits.  Those dismissals, however, 
were based, not upon motions for summary judgment or for dismissal for want of jurisdiction, but rather upon motions to dismiss 
for failure to state a claim.  In such cases, of course, the allegations of the complaint must be taken as true.  Id., at 224. In the 
case now before us, the District Court clearly went beyond the face of the complaint and required respondents to produce proof 
of interstate effects. "
788,1," HN1[
] Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18, in pertinent part reads: No corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share 
capital and no corporation subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission shall acquire the whole or any part of 
the assets of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where in any line of commerce in any section of the country, 
the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly."
788,2," That note reads: We think that any effort to convert Section 7 of the Clayton Act into a per se violation of the anti-trust laws so as to give rise 
to a private right of action under the Clayton Act has been squarely checked by what is said by Mr. Chief Justice Warren in "
789,," Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510. As interpreted in that case, Section 7 of 
the Clayton Act does not condemn all mergers, but only those having demonstrable anti-competitive effects. The statute 
deals with clear-cut menaces to competition, not with accomplished monopolies, presently creating damages to a 
competitor, which is the sine qua non of a private right of action under Section 5 of the Clayton Act. Section 7 of the Clayton Act was intended to supplement the Sherman Act and: ""primarily to arrest apprehended consequences of intercorporate relationships before those relationships could work their 
evil, which may be at or any time after the acquisition, depending upon the circumstances of the particular case."" United States v. duPont & Co., 353 U.S. 586, at 597, 77 S. Ct. 872, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1057. * * * That no private right of action

television rights from the antitrust laws; the 1964 reporting out by a Senate Committee of a bill exempting professional league 
sports in all its phases from antitrust; the 1958 sponsorship by then Senator John F. Kennedy of a bill that would have provided 
a substantially unqualified antitrust exemption for the player rules of all professional sports leagues, the Senator stating that 
these leagues are so unique that they cannot be treated in the same manner as other businesses; the 1966 enactment of 15 
U.S.C. § 1291, authorizing merger of the American Football League with the National Football League."
799,5," As to the Department of Justice, defendants refer to a 1961 acknowledgment by the Department that professional league 
teams must have some joint agreements to assure continued functioning of leagues, that Congress has so indicated and that, 
therefore, investigation of NFL player transfer rules was unwarranted; also the 1971 similar acknowledgment that some

813,1, The plaintiffs did not disagree but suggested at oral argument as a word of caution that there might be more. 
814,2," Although questions were raised as to the application of the Interlocutory Appeals Act to the order of the trial court certifying the 
appeal as an interlocutory one, those questions were briefed by counsel on both sides and the order granting permission to 
submit an interlocutory appeal was granted by another panel of this court. We do not further examine that question."
814,3," Rule 23(b) states in pertinent part: HN3[
] ""(b) . . . An action may be maintained as a class action if the prerequisites of subdivision (a) are satisfied, and in 
addition: . . . ""(3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions 
affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient 
adjudication of the controversy. The matters pertinent to the findings include: (A) the interest of members of the class in 
individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning 
the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class; (C) the desirability or undesirability of 
concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; (D) the difficulties likely to be encountered in the 
management of a class action."" As originally enacted, Rule 23 would not have accommodated a suit like that filed here. It provided only for a ""true class suit"" 
where, but for the rule, the joinder of all interested persons would have been essential, 3B Moore Federal Practice (1974) para. 
23.08; the ""hybrid"" class suit where the interests of the parties were several but concerned a specific property, id. para. 23.09; 
and, the ""spurious"" class suit where there was no jural relationship between the parties but a common question of law or fact 
existed. Such an action was an invitation to those having such an interest to join but not a requirement that they accept. Id. para. "
815,23," .10. The importance of Rule 23 at this time was not outstanding. In 1966 the rule was amended to provide a more flexible 
remedy. Recoveries would be available for or on behalf of all members of the class and the judgments binding upon all provided 
the requirements of the rule were met. The popularity of class actions increased fourfold within a period of four years and 
developed a host of champions and critics. Compare Blecher, Is the Class Action Rule Doing the Job? (Plaintiff's viewpoint) with 
Simon, ClassActions -- Useful Tool or Engine of Destruction, 55 F.R.D. 365, 375. The courts have had their own difficulties in 
solving the problems generated by the rule.  Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 370 F.2d 119 (2d Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 
1035, 18 L. Ed. 2d 598, 87 S. Ct. 1487 (1967) (Eisen I); Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 391 F.2d 555 (2d Cir. 1968) (Eisen II);

U.S.L.W. 4804 (1974) (Eisen III). The Supreme Court at the last term, October 1973, passed upon two cases involving the scope of class actions.  Zahn v. 
International Paper Co., 414 U.S. 291, 38 L. Ed. 2d 511, 94 S. Ct. 505 (1973), held that a diversity action seeking damages 
could not be maintained on behalf of unnamed plaintiffs whose claims did not meet the jurisdictional amount requirements.  
Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 94 S. Ct. 2140, 40 L. Ed. 2d 732, 42 U.S.L.W. 4804 (1974), upheld the decision of 
the Court of Appeals in Eisen III, supra, that individual notice must be given to all identifiable members of the class at the 
plaintiff's expense and that a preliminary or ""mini-hearing"" on the merits to determine whether it might be maintained as a class 
action was improper. Our own court has had more than one occasion to consider the problems of Rule 23 as amended. Most recently we have had 
before us La Mar v. H & B Novelty & Loan Co., 489 F.2d 461 (9th Cir. 1973), and In Re Hotel Telephone Charges, 500 F.2d 86 
(9th Cir. 1974)."
815,4, 15 U.S.C. § 1 states: 
816,," ""§ 1.  Trusts, etc., in restraint of trade illegal; exception of resale price agreements; penalty ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal: Provided, That nothing contained in sections 1 to 7 of this 
title shall render illegal, contracts or agreements prescribing minimum prices for the resale of a commodity which bears, or 
the label or container of which bears, the trademark, brand, or name of the producer or distributor of such commodity and 
which is in free and open competition with commodities of the same general class produced or distributed by others, when 
contracts or agreements of that description are lawful as applied to intrastate transactions, under any statute, law, or public 
policy now or hereafter in effect in any State, Territory, or the District of Columbia in which such resale is to be made, or to 
which the commodity is to be transported for such resale, and the making of such contracts or agreements shall not be an 
unfair method of competition under section 45 of this title: Provided further, That the preceding proviso shall not make 
lawful any contract or agreement, providing for the establishment or maintenance of minimum resale prices on any 
commodity herein involved, between manufacturers, or between producers, or between wholesalers, or between brokers, 
or between factors, or between retailers, or between persons, firms, or corporations in competition with each other. Every 
person who shall make any contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy declared by sections 1 to 7 of this title to 
be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding fifty 
thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court."""
816,15," U.S.C. § 15 states: ""§ 15.  Suits by persons injured; amount of recovery ""Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue 
therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, 
without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of 
suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."" "
818,5," Assuming 400,000 transactions causing damage by excess commissions in the estimated sum of over $250,000,000 the 
average recoverable damage amounts to $625. Trebled, the individual recovery would amount to $1,875 and the aggregate to 
$750,000,000, the amount of the prayer. To arrive at that average figure, obviously many damage claims have been estimated 
that would result in a figure considerably in excess of that average. Since attorneys' fees and costs are also recoverable in a 
successful 15 U.S.C.§ 15 action, it may be safely assumed that a great many of the cases could be separately prosecuted. "
819,6," Affidavits of some defendants in the file vehemently assert that they did not follow the Board's suggestions; others may assert 
other defenses which would make litigation of a claim a poor plaintiff's risk. "

820,8," It has been suggested that generalized proof of damages might suffice under Rule 23. But the Rule does not eliminate the 
ultimate need for individual proof of damages by each member of the class. Nor does it foreclose the right of each defendant to 
assert his defenses before a jury if one is requested."
820,28," U.S.C. § 2072 states in pertinent part: ""The Supreme Court shall have the power to prescribe by general rules, the forms of process . . . and the practice and 
procedure of the district courts and courts of appeals of the United States in civil actions . . . . ""Such rules shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right and shall preserve the right of trial by jury as at

37 L. Ed. 2d 522, 93 S. Ct. 2448 (1973); Class Action Symposium, 68 NW.U.L.Rev. 991, 1049 (1974). "
821,9," Again, generalized proof is suggested, as presumably a witness would testify as to what was a fair commission absent the 
schedule. But the defendant as to each transaction would be entitled to give his particularized version. The suggested 
commission schedule by its terms applies to ""normal"" sales. "
827,8," We are not so sure as Sun, see Gray v. Shell Oil Co., 469 F.2d 742 (9th Cir. 1972), cert. denied 412 U.S. 943, 93 S. Ct. 2773,

828,2," In Walker v. Columbia University, 18 F.R. Serv. 2d 520 (S.D.N.Y. 1974) the court relied upon a local rule which required the 
plaintiff in a class action suit to move within 60 days for determination thereof in denying a motion for class determination which 
came 4 weeks late.  In Edwards v. Schlesinger, 377 F. Supp. 1091, 1093 (D.C. 1974) the court found plaintiff's motion for a class 
action untimely where it was made beyond the 90 days specified therefor in the district's local rules. "
836,1," The antitrust counterclaim remains unchanged in the Amended Answer and Counterclaim filed on November 8, 1974."
836,2," Respondents' local counsel indicates in his December 26, 1974 affidavit that he cleared further proceedings on this 
counterclaim with the Court in a November conference.  However, that inquiry was solely whether federal antitrust claims 
contemplated but not yet asserted were covered by the sweep of the injunction, to which this Court's response was in the 
negative. "

384, 95 L. Ed. 1035, 71 S. Ct. 745 -- was made in paragraph (3) of § 2 of the McGuire Act.HN2[

commodity at less than the price or prices prescribed in such contracts or agreements whether the person so advertising, 
offering for sale, or selling is or is not a party to such a contract or agreement, is unfair competition and is actionable at the 
suit of any person damaged thereby."" 66 Stat. 632; 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(3).  The ""vendee"" clause and the ""when lawful"" clause, which we construe in this case, are found in paragraph (2) of § 2, quoted in 
the text infra."
874,12," Note the inclusion of the phrase ""or stipulated"" in paragraph (2) of § 2 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(2), quoted infra."
874,13," The McGuire Act amendments were to § 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45, and not to § 1 of the 
Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, as was the Miller-Tydings Act. Nevertheless, the changes made in the McGuire Act were clearly 
intended to affect § 1 of the Sherman Act as well, as the ""Nothing contained in this Act or in any of the Antitrust Acts . . ."" 
language in paragraphs (2) and (3) of § 2 indicates. "
875,14," If the same descriptive language had been used twice to describe two types of vertical agreements, it would be obvious that 
the word ""resale"" had two different meanings. Comparable meaning would be conveyed by a provision describing ""(a) 
agreements prescribing minimum or stipulated prices for the resale of a commodity . . ., and (b) agreements requiring a vendee 
to enter into contracts or agreements prescribing minimum or stipulated prices for the resale of a commodity. . . ."" In part (a) of 
such a provision the word ""resale"" would refer to the first resale whereas in part (b) the same word would refer to a subsequent 
resale."
875,15," Alternatively, the word ""vendee"" might be interpreted as referring to a retailer who purchased from a wholesaler-party to a fair 
trade contract with the defendant manufacturer. Under that interpretation, the word ""resale"" would still refer to the sale by the 
retailer, rather than to the wholesaler's resale."
875,16," Although Corning argues for a literal interpretation of the clause, it does not expressly suggest that the word ""resale"" should be 
given a double meaning. On the contrary, Corning argues that the words ""such resale"" refer to the first resale the first time they 
are used in the ""when lawful"" clause and to the second resale the second time they are used in that clause. It is, however, 
perfectly clear that any difference in meaning between the first and second portions of the ""when lawful"" clause -- between 
contracts ""lawful . . in any State . . . in which such resale is to be made"" and ""lawful . . . in any State . . . to which the commodity 
is to be transported for such resale"" -- could not have been intended to have any relevance to the problem presented by this 
case. For, we reiterate, the vendee clause was not a part of the statute when that language was first enacted. We therefore need 
not express any opinion on the significance, or possible superfluity, of that clause as applied to situations not before us. See the 
discussion in the Commission opinion, Corning Glass Works, 82 F.T.C. 1675, 1759 (1973). We find neither textual nor historical 
support for Corning's suggestion that the word ""resale"" has one meaning when it is used in the first portion of the ""when lawful"" 
clause and a different meaning when it is used in the second portion of that clause. If this is not a fair statement of Corning's 
argument, and if it is really contending that the word refers to the second, rather than the first, resale in both parts of the ""when 
lawful"" clause, then the transport clause would be just as superfluous as Corning asserts it to be under the Commission's 
interpretation; for in that event, the first portion of the ""when lawful"" clause would compel the result for which Corning contends. "
876,17," The price-fixing clause would be tested by the law of the state where the wholesaler is located but the customer restriction 
clause would be tested by the law of the state or states where the wholesaler's customers are located."
876,18," HN4[
] It is, of course, ""common experience that identical words may be used in the same statute, or even in the same 
section of a statute, with quite different meanings."" Wood v. Dennis, 489 F.2d 849, 853 (7th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 
960, 94 S. Ct. 1490, 39 L. Ed. 2d 575 (1974) and cases cited therein. We attach greater significance to the Supreme Court's 
repeated admonition that HN5[
] exemptions from the antitrust laws are to be strictly construed, see, e.g., United States v. McKesson & Robbins, Inc., 351 U.S. 305, 316, 100 L. Ed. 1209, 76 S. Ct. 937; United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, 374 
U.S. 321, 348, 10 L. Ed. 2d 915, 83 S. Ct. 1715, than to following a nice literal construction which is certainly not compelled by 
either the history or the purpose of this statute."
876,19," Moreover, the language of Corning's own agreement purports to make its application to the parties depend upon the law of the 
place ""where it is lawful so to agree."" One might expect this language to refer to the place where the agreement at issue was 
either made or is to be performed rather than to the place where persons who are not parties to the agreement conduct their 
business."
876,20," It would be particularly anomalous to have the validity of a customer restriction clause which restrains a wholesaler in free 
trade state ""A"" -- and merely affects the prices at which retailers may sell in fair trade state ""B"" -- turn on the legality of customer 
restriction clauses in state ""B"". Corning's position would be less anomalous if it made the validity of the customer restriction 
clause in state ""A"" turn on the legality of the price-fixing section in state ""B"". There is no way the present statutory language can 
be so interpreted."
876,21,"  ""It should be observed, in the first place, that the bill under consideration is simply an enabling act. It permits the States, 
without the complications of possible violation of Federal law, to carry into effect their own public policy, and it is limited to a 
specific type of legislation now on the statute books of 27 States. ""These State laws are applicable only to transactions consummated wholly within the borders of the State in which the 
legislation is in effect, that is to say, they apply only to sales made by one person to another within the territorial confines of 
the State."" Hearings on S. 100 before the Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, ""Resale Price 
Maintenance,"" 75th Cong., 1st Sess. 42 (1937). "
877,22,"  ""That it is the purpose of this Act to protect the rights of States under the United States Constitution to regulate their internal 
affairs and more particularly to enact statutes and laws, and to adopt policies, which authorize contracts and agreements 
prescribing minimum or stipulated prices for the resale of commodities and to extend the minimum or stipulated prices 
prescribed by such contracts and agreements to persons who are not parties thereto. It is the further purpose of this Act to 
permit such statutes, laws, and public policies to apply to commodities, contracts, agreements, and activities in or affecting 
interstate or foreign commerce."" 66 Stat. 631-632; 15 U.S.C. § 45 (""Purpose of Act July 14, 1952"") (1970) (emphasis 
added)."
877,23,"  ""Corning does not in any way fix the price at which the Missouri wholesaler resells the merchandise to any customer. The 
Missouri wholesaler determines the price at which he sells to any of his customers -- including an Illinois retailer. . . ."" Brief 
for Petitioner at 26."
877,24," Thus, where a Washington, D.C., wholesaler sold fair traded goods to a New York retailer for resale in New York, the New 
York fair trade act determined the antitrust immunity of price maintenance provisions. See Mead Johnson & Co. v. G-E-X, Inc. of 
Albany, 37 Misc. 2d 491, 496-497, 235 N.Y.S. 2d 951, 956-957 (Sup. Ct. 1963). Where, however, a Washington, D.C., 
establishment sold fair traded goods directly to consumers in Maryland and New York, the manufacturers were unable to rely on 
the fair trade acts of those states to impose resale price maintenance. The fair trade public policy of the District of Columbia, 
where the resale at issue took place, governed. See General Electric Co. v. Masters Mail Order Co., 244 F.2d 681, 684 (2d Cir. 
1957), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 824, 2 L. Ed. 2d 39, 78 S. Ct. 32; Revere Camera Co. v. Masters Mail Order Co., 128 F. Supp. 
457 (D. Md. 1955)."
877,25," It is clear that, absent statutory exemption, such a customer restriction clause would violate the federal antitrust laws. ""A distributor of a trade-marked article may not lawfully limit by agreement, express or implied, the price at which or the 
persons to whom its purchaser may resell, except as the seller moves along the route which is marked by the Miller-
Tydings Act."" United States v. Bausch & Lomb Optical Co., 321 U.S. 707, 721, 88 L. Ed. 1024, 64 S. Ct. 805 (emphasis 
added).  "
878,," The Commission concluded that such customer restriction clauses would also be unlawful as a matter of state law in free trade 
states.  82 F.T.C. 1675, 1754 n. 9 (1973). Corning has not disputed this conclusion."
878,26,"  As Corning states at page 28 of its brief, ""Since the only purpose of the vendee provision in Corning's Wholesaler Fair 
Trade Agreement is to effectively maintain the price in the second resale, it follows that we must look to the law of the state 
in which the second resale occurs to determine the propriety of the vendee provision."""
878,27," Amicus Rubbermaid, Inc., argues that since goods shipped from a free trade state become subject to fair trade control upon 
arrival for resale in a fair trade state, ""it opposes logic to invest the shippers with [fair trade control] immunity on the basis of their 
geographic locations."" Brief for Amicus at 19 n. 14. What Rubbermaid ignores is that the determination of the antitrust immunity 
of an eventual price restriction upon resale in a fair trade state is logically separate from the determination of the immunity of a 
contractual vendee clause that imposes a serious restraint on the free selection of customers by a free trade state wholesaler. 
Congress' express desire to immunize specific ""contracts"" should not be broadly read to mean the immunization of a series of 
contracts simply because the end result, price maintenance, is sanctioned by a state fair trade law."
878,28," In Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert Distillers Corp., 341 U.S. 384, 95 L. Ed. 1035, 71 S. Ct. 745, the Court recognized a 
comparable distinction between ""price fixing by contract or agreement"" and ""price fixing by compulsion"" (p. 388), or between 
""coercive"" and ""voluntary"" schemes or arrangements (p. 394)."
878,29," We recognize that as a practical matter a fair trade program in a non-signer state may be impaired to the extent that a 
manufacturer is unwilling to assume the litigation costs associated with enforcement, particularly since such costs include the 
risk that a non-signer state will be judicially changed into a signer-only state, as recently occurred in North Carolina. Bulova 
Watch Co., Inc. v. Brand Distributors of North Wilkesboro, Inc., 285 N.C. 467, 206 S.E.2d 141 (1974). Although possible infirmity "
879,," in the state of the law in a non-signer jurisdiction may provide a legitimate explanation for a manufacturer's decision to avoid 
litigation and to use customer restriction clauses as a method of enforcing its fair trade program, such possible infirmity is not a 
factor we may properly assess in considering the impact of our holding in a non-signer jurisdiction. For, if the test of litigation 
would disclose that some jurisdictions are improperly classified as non-signer states, the policy considerations applicable to free 
trade and signer-only states should be respected in those states. "
880,30," This relief was ordered based on the violation alleged in Count I of the Complaint. See n. 7, supra.  The parties had stipulated 
prior to the FTC decision that if a violation were found on Count II, relief could be ordered on Counts I and IV as well."

been direct competitors in the sale of epoxy resin to crusher users."
896,42," .  Prior to the filing of the present action, Defendant requested a license under Patent No.  2,970,783 from Plaintiff.  Plaintiff 
did not offer Defendant a license under Patent No.  2,970,783 until after the filing of Defendant's antitrust counterclaim herein, 
and then offered a license at a royalty rate four times greater than the royalty rate provided in the Plaintiff's other licenses."
896,43," .  The sales of ""Nordbak"" with said implied license to practice Patent No.  2,970,783 constitute tying contracts between 
Plaintiff and crusher users buying ""Nordbak"" from it."
896,44," .  The tying item is the right to practice Patent No.  2,970,783 which accompanies each can of ""Nordbak."" The requisite 
economic power in the tying item is provided by the purported Patent No.  2,970,783."
896,45," .  The tied item is epoxy resin, and the relevant market and line of commerce herein affected is the national market in epoxy 
resin."
896,46," .  The sales of ""Nordbak"" epoxy resin to crusher users in the above-described manner have been substantial, exceeding Five 
Hundred Fifty Thousand ($550,000) Dollars in 1971."
896,47," .  The effect of Plaintiff-counterdefendant's tie-in sales of ""Nordbak"" with an implied license and its infringement actions has 
been to restrain trade and to substantially lessen competition in the sale of epoxy resin to crusher users in violation of Section 1 
of the Sherman Act, Section 1, Title 15, United States Code."
896,48," .  Defendant is entitled to an injunction against the continuation of said antitrust violation pending the within adjudication of the 
invalidity of the patent in suit becoming final. When the said finding of invalidity becomes final, no further injunction will be 
required. If Patent No.  2,970,783 is later found to be valid, Defendant shall be entitled to a permanent injunction."
896,49," .  Plaintiff by its use of Patent No.  2,970,783, as set forth in Findings 31-47, has misused said patent, rendering the patent 
unenforceable."" "
897,2," Rex is correct in its contention that the fact that no one has yet asked them for a direct license (and consequently no one was 
refused one) is evidence that there is no economic tying effect or misuse present.  Federal Sign & Signal Corp. v. Bangor Punta 
Op. Inc., 357 F. Supp. 1222 at 1240 (S.D.N.Y. 1973); Ansul Co. v. Uniroyal Inc., 306 F. Supp. 541, 562-63 (S.D.N.Y. 1969), 448 
F.2d 872 (2d Cir. 1971), cert. denied 404 U.S. 1018, 92 S. Ct. 680, 30 L. Ed. 2d 666 (1972); however, it is not conclusive of the 
point. It is merely one factor to be considered by the district court. E.g.: ""At the oral argument it seemed to me that the method of business adopted by the plaintiff in the case at bar could not be 
considered objectionable in the absence of a finding that the plaintiff had refused or would refuse to grant an unrestricted 
license to any shoe manufacturer who chose to buy from some other source the materials used in reinforcing the insoles by 
the patented process. That is, if the plaintiff is prepared to grant an unrestricted license on a royalty basis to any shoe 
manufacturers who prefer to obtain the unpatented precoated duck and top coat elsewhere, it is difficult at first blush to see 
how the plaintiff would be doing anything wrong in furnishing the unpatented materials and incidental services at so much 
per web yard of duck to those shoe manufacturers who prefer to do business with the plaintiff on that basis. But this point 
was urged in Leitch Mfg. Co. v. Barber Co., supra, and it was pointed out in the plaintiff's brief before the Supreme Court 
that the plaintiff was 'not shown to have refused to grant any license under the patent, much less granted any license 
conditioned on purchase of emulsion from it.' The argument was to no avail. The court considered it sufficient to condemn 
the plaintiff's method of doing business, that, as matters stood, no road contractor had a license to practice the patented 
process except those contractors who bought their bituminous emulsion from the plaintiff.""  B. B. Chemical Co. v. Ellis, 117 F.2d 829 at 838 (1st Cir. 1941) (Magruder, C.J. Concurring), aff'd 314 U.S. 495, 86 L. Ed. 367, 
62 S. Ct. 406 (1942)."
897,3," There is ample evidence in the record to support the district court's finding that ""Nordbak"" was a staple commodity. It is well 
settled that the mere addition of extenders to a staple article does not make the article nonstaple.  Dr. Salsbury's Laboratories v. 
I.D. Russell Co., 212 F.2d 414 (8th Cir. 1954), cert. denied 348 U.S. 837, 99 L. Ed. 660, 75 S. Ct. 50 (1954). There the court 
held that the addition of other dilutive ingredients to a staple article of commerce does not cause the article ""to lose its 
characteristics as a common raw material."" (p. 417) This is particularly true here since the extenders are not ""components"" of the "
898,," invention. The epoxy resin present in ""Nordbak"" is the only component of the patent at issue and that is a staple article of 
commerce."
898,3," a In oral argument counsel for Rex argued that crusher users have an alternative to the can label license in that users can 
purchase a new crusher from Rex.  In view of the fact that the backing material in a crusher will wear out many times during the 
life of a crusher, we hardly think that being required to purchase an expensive new machine when the backing wears out is a 
viable alternative to the can label license. A great economic disparity in alternatives will just as effectively create or enforce a tie 
as the absence of choice.  Rex argues that if it wanted to, under the patent laws, it could sell the crusher alone, and not grant 
can label licenses. This may well be so, but Rex has not chosen to follow this course.  HN7[
] A patentee has a privilege to 
exploit its patent, but this privilege does not encompass tying. Tying is disapproved because of its ""anti-competitive"" affects upon 
the market of the tied product.  If Rex had chosen to sell crushers alone, an affect on a tied market would be absent; but as it 
stands now, the can label licensing program adopted by Rex, by effectively and practically foreclosing and limiting the sources 
from which crusher users may look to purchase staple epoxy resin, has substantially burdened competition in the market of that 
tied product."
898,4," Rex's licensees are producers of epoxy resin whom Rex has in the past sued for contributory infringement and with whom it 
has settled. This is further evidence of the effect upon the tied market. Rex has in effect achieved the result that it is licensing its 
licensees to produce epoxy resin for use in its patent process. That is, part of the royalties are derived not from the right to 
practice the patent, but rather from the right to sell unpatented epoxy resin (the tied product). "
899,5," (C.T. 1092, 1096-98) (Findings as numbered) ""27.  Assuming the patent were valid, then Defendant has, by its bulletin for epoxy resin sold under the name ""Rockfill,"" and its

912,2," SOHIO has, through its vice-president Robert Griffin, recited the jurisdictional liturgy usually intoned by foreign corporations 
trying to evade personal jurisdiction: during the period in question, SOHIO was never incorporated, was not licensed to do 
business and did not in fact do business in Maryland; it never designated an agent for service of process in the State; it never 
sold, marketed, advertised or purchased products in the State; it never entered into any contracts, owned property, performed 
services, maintained an office, facility or telephone number in the State; and it never employed or had any officers or agents 
present in the State for any purpose. See generally, Note, Venue in Private Antitrust Suits, 37 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 268, 282-84

912,3," SOHIO's reliance on Cannon is reminiscent of Standard Oil of New Jersey's reliance on the same case in Flank Oil Co. v. 
Continental Oil Co., 277 F. Supp. 357 (D. Colo. 1967). "
913,4," In Flank Oil Co. v. Continental Oil Co., 277 F. Supp. 357 (D. Colo. 1967), the court remarked on the impact of Cannon on 
antitrust cases: As previously noted, Standard places its chief reliance on the Cudahy line of cases, all of which are concerned with whether 
the non-resident parent exercises day-to-day control over the subsidiary. . . . Such holdings are attractive because they 
establish a degree of certainty in an area in which the lines of authority are difficult to reconcile. . . . Although reconciliation of the diverse viewpoints expressed in Cudahy and Scophony is difficult, we believe that one logical 
explanation is that Scophony is an antitrust case while Cudahy is not. This brings Section 12 of the Clayton Act into play 
and in turn provides a more broad gauge test than was available in Cudahy. Also, there are underlying policy reasons in an 
antitrust case which call for a more penetrating analysis of business activity within a state in search of potential antitrust 
activity. So where, as here, there exists a great concentration of economic power capable of making a tremendous 
economic impact while at the same time presenting a picture of formal separation, one must look beyond formalism. For 
these reasons we are of the opinion that Scophony furnishes a more accurate guide to decision in this case than does 
Cudahy."

913,5," The only case to construe section 12 in this Circuit, Donlan v. Carvel, 193 F. Supp. 246 (D. Md. 1961) (Thomsen, J.), relied 
solely on Scophony and did not mention Cannon. "
914,6," The following decisions have held that the separation was sufficient and controls so few that the separation between parent

American Telephone and Telegraph Co., 364 F. Supp. 1157 (W.D. Tex. 1973) (furnishing of interstate long distance telephone

941,22," There, Judge Waterman said: ""It appears to be without question that, today, professional baseball, with its complex web of franchises, farm teams and 
recruiters, and its multi-million dollar contracts with television and radio networks, is interstate commerce. Our difficulty lies in 
determining to what extent, if at all, the states are precluded from antitrust regulation of interstate commerce. See Note, The 
Commerce Clause and State Antitrust Regulation, 61 Colum.L.Rev. 1469 (1961). The Supreme Court has not, to our knowledge, 
expressed any opinion as to the outer limits of state antitrust policy, although it has clearly held that state antitrust policy is not 
ousted from the regulation of local matters which may also be affected by federal laws. Therefore, we turn for guidance to cases 
involving other areas of state regulation. HN16[
] ""Where the nature of an enterprise is such that differing state regulation, although not conflicting, requires the 
enterprise to comply with the strictest standard of several states in order to continue an interstate business extending over many 
states, the extra-territorial effect which the application of a particular state law would exact constitutes, absent a strong state 
interest, an impermissible burden on interstate commerce. Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona, 325 U.S. 761, 774-775, 65 S. Ct. 
1515, 89 L. Ed. 1915 (1945). ""Professional baseball clubs, although existing as separate legal entitles, are organized into so-called leagues for competitive 
play and are dependent on the league playing schedule to further the ends of their sports competition.  Therefore, it is the league 
structure at which any state antitrust regulation must be aimed if organized professional baseball is not to be severely 
fragmented.  On the one hand, it is apparent that each league extends over many states, and that, if state regulation were 
permissible, the internal structure of the leagues would require compliance with the strictest state antitrust standard.  The 
consequent extraterritorial effect of necessary compliance would be considerably more far-reaching than that in Southern Pacific 
Co. v. Arizona, supra. On the other hand, we do not find that a state's interest in antitrust regulation, when compared with its 
interest in health and safety regulation, is of particular urgency.  Hence, HN17[

946,31," ""So far as the union might have achieved this result acting alone, it would have been the natural consequence of labor union 
activities exempted by the Clayton Act from coverage of the Sherman Act. But when the unions participated with a combination 
of business men who had complete power to eliminate all competition among themselves and to prevent all competition from 
others, a situation was created not included within the exemptions of the Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia Acts. ""It must be remembered that the exemptions granted the unions were special exemptions to a general legislative plan.  The 
primary objective of all the Anti-trust legislation has been to preserve business competition and to proscribe business monopoly.  
It would be a surprising thing if Congress, in order to prevent a misapplication of that legislation to labor unions, had bestowed 
upon such unions complete and unreviewable authority to aid business groups to frustrate its primary objective. . . . ""Our holding means that HN26[
] the same labor union activities may or may not be in violation of the Sherman Act, dependent 
upon whether the union acts alone or in combination with business groups.  This, it is argued, brings about a wholly undesirable 
result -- one which leaves labor unions free to engage in conduct which restrains trade.  But the desirability of such an 
exemption of labor unions is a question for the determination of Congress."" Id. at 809-10."
946,32," The argument was raised by defendants there, as here, that economic history since the enactment of the Clayton Act compels 
an interpretation of the exemption which is not one-sided.  I adopt that court's response, which was that if the exemption is to be

948,35," ""This rule flows directly from the Hutcheson holding that a union acting as a union, in the interests of its members, and not 
acting to fix prices or allocate markets in aid of an employer conspiracy to accomplish these objects, with only indirect union 
benefits, is not subject to challenge under the antitrust laws. To hold that mandatory collective bargaining is completely protected 
would effectuate the congressional policies of encouraging free collective bargaining, subject only to specific restrictions 
contained in the labor laws, and of limiting judicial intervention in labor matters via the antitrust route -- an intervention which 
necessarily under the Sherman Act places on judges and juries the determination of 'what public policy in regard to the industrial 
struggle demands.'"" Ibid."
948,36," First, he reaffirmed the principle that the exemption arose for the benefit of labor, 381 U.S. at 700-11; nothing was said which 
indicated that employers could enjoy that exemption save derivatively through negotiations with unions over mandatory subjects 
of bargaining. Id. at 711-12. Second, Justice Goldberg limited those subjects as to which bargaining is compulsory to lawful 
ones; violations of the antitrust laws, see discussion, infra, would not come within the ambit of mandatory bargaining: ""The direct and overriding interest of unions in such subjects as wages, hours, and other working conditions, which 
Congress has recognized in making them subjects of mandatory bargaining, is clearly lacking where the subject of the 
agreement is price-fixing and market allocation.  Moreover, such activities are at the core of the type of anticompetitive 
commercial restraint at which the antitrust laws are directed."" Id. at 732-33."
948,37," The Court of Appeals and the District Court also decided that the orchestra leaders were not a ""non-labor"" group within the 
meaning of Allen Bradley and Pennington. "

Those items are mandatory subjects of bargaining; a party who refuses to negotiate regarding these matters commits an ""unfair 
labor practice."" See NLRB v. Wooster Division of Borg-Warner Corp., 356 U.S. 342, 349, 2 L. Ed. 2d 823, 78 S. Ct. 718 (1958). "

commentator has said of this ruling: ""First-round draft choices are extremely valuable and this price exacted by the commissioner is an indication that signing a 
supposedly free agent who has played out his option may cost the new team more than the player is worth.  Thus a player 
who has played out his option must now convince a new team that he is worth not only the salary he is seeking but also the 
loss of any player on the new team which the commissioner, in his total and unappealable discretion, considers to be 
adequate compensation to the old team."" Playing the Game in a Bidding War, supra, at 389 ."

Musicians of the United States and Canada, 372 F.2d 155, 165 (2d Cir. 1967), that collective bargaining history is irrelevant.  In 
Carroll, the regulations were unilaterally imposed by a union largely on persons who were members of the union.  Moreover, the 
Court of Appeals three years later in Intercontinental Transport, supra n. 27, explored bargaining history, and finally ascertained 
who sought and obtained the provision in question.  In any case, I propose to follow the course set in Philadelphia Hockey, supra

967,3," Similarly referenced was J. W. Peterson Coal & Oil Co. v. United States, 323 F. Supp. 1198, 1201 (N.D. Ill. 1970), where the 
action of the United States in supplying a dredging contractor with maps and information as to river depths and dredging 
locations was held sufficient to invoke admiralty jurisdiction in tort."
967,4," Apart from relying on the general locality test for admiralty tort jurisdiction, appellees cite only four cases said to be closely in 
point.  One is Kamara v. The Atlantic Emperor, 97 F. Supp. 722 (E.D. Pa. 1951), referred to in n. 2, supra, and which simply 
declared that the alleged blacklisting of crew members had not occurred on navigable waters. This we find close on point but not 
persuasive. Clinton v. International Organization of Masters, 254 F.2d 370 (9th Cir. 1958), involved, inter alia, a claim of tortious 
interference with a contract between a union member and his local union governing allocation of available jobs. The court held 
the contract not maritime in nature and further observed that the tort was not alleged to have been committed on navigable 
waters. We find this less on point and no more persuasive. Finally, two old cases from the Southern District of New York were 
cited.  Marquardt v. French, 53 F. 603 (1893), simply held that, a contract to procure insurance not being a maritime contract, "
968,," suit for its breach would not lie in admiralty. In Williams v. Providence Washington Ins. Co., 56 F. 159, 160 (1893), the court held 
that a claim for false representations in inducing purchase of a maritime insurance policy, not ""arising upon the water"", did not 
state a maritime tort. Marquardt is not in point and Williams no more persuasive than the other ipse dixits. "

at 53-54 (May 8, 1974). "
988,5," Plaintiff's damage figure was computed according to the following formula: (a) Plaintiff was 52 years of age at the time of her termination of employment , earning a salary of $9,620 annually, with an 
excellent employment record; (b) Plaintiff could reasonably have anticipated that she would have continued to earn at least that figure with accompanying 
increases in contributions to the retirement fund until she reached the age of 62, but for the alleged wrongful termination; (c) That therefore plaintiff is entitled to $96,200 lost wages ($9,620 per year times 10 years) plus approximately $18,000 in lost 
retirement benefits during that time; (d) That this damage figure, $114,200 ($96,200 plus $18,000) should be trebled in accordance with the antitrust provision for 
treble damages, 15 U.S.C. § 15, resulting in total damages of $442,600 ($114,200 x 3). "
989,6," Plaintiff contends that she began employment with defendant in January, 1953, and that her length of service should be 
considered to be 20 years. Defendant contends that plaintiff began her employment in November, 1953, and that her length of 
service is 19 years. See Deposition of Plaintiff at 85-86 (May 8, 1974)."
989,7," There is some indication that this dispute has been settled by the parties. See Deposition of Plaintiff at 85-86 (May 8, 1974). 
Should there be no dispute, the Court should be so advised."
989,8," Plaintiff has apparently received some money. See Deposition of Plaintiff at 76 (May 8, 1974)."
989,9," In her first amended complaint, plaintiff alleged violation of the antitrust laws of the United States and of Texas.  15 U.S.C. § 1; 
TEX. BUS. & COMM. CODE §§ 15.02-15.04. However, plaintiff has subsequently abandoned argument on the state antitrust 
claim. See Plaintiff's Supplemental Memorandum Opposing the Motions for Summary Judgment and to Dismiss at 5 (August 13, 
1974). Therefore, this claim must be dismissed and is not considered by the Court in this opinion."

No. 31, 481 F.2d 122, 126-28 (9th Cir. 1973). "
990,12," Plaintiff also satisfies the collateral requirements of standing: that plaintiff has an intention to enter into a business; and that 
plaintiff is prepared to enter into a business.  North Texas Producers Ass'n v. Young, supra. Not only has the instant plaintiff 
taken affirmative action to enter into the shoe-selling business, she has already made such an entry by opening the Conroe 
store. This entry, coupled with plaintiff's long experience in shoe store management and operation and her accompanying 
expertise, well-qualifies her to have standing. See Deposition of Plaintiff at 25-37 (May 8, 1974)."

990,14," The proper distinction to this Court does not appear to be injury to salary as compared with injury to assigned sales territories 
and commission. Rather, injury to business or property that belongs to the corporation in which the employee's claim is 
derivative should be compared with injury to property that is directly attributable to the employee in which the corporation asserts 
an adverse interest. "
991,15," ""Rule of reason"" analysis is appropriate in this case because the complained of activity has not been held per se violative of 
Section 1. The following restraints of trade have been deemed to be per se illegal: (a) horizontal price fixing, United States v. Socony-
Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 84 L. Ed. 1129, 60 S. Ct. 811 (1940); (b) resale price maintenance, Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John 
D. Park & Sons Co., 220 U.S. 373, 55 L. Ed. 502, 31 S. Ct. 376 (1911); (c) division of markets, United States v. Arnold, Schwinn 
& Co., 388 U.S. 365, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1249, 87 S. Ct. 1856 (1967); (d) group boycotts, Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 
359 U.S. 207, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741, 79 S. Ct. 705 (1959); (e) tying arrangements, International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S.

992,16," Defendant's employment policy amounts to a ""present"" restrictive covenant not to compete; i.e., a covenant between an 
employer and current employees. Such covenants, which usually involve restrictions on an employee's post-employment 
activities, have received little attention in federal antitrust actions because of the localized nature of such controversies and their 
apparently successful regulation, where appropriate, by state antitrust laws. See, e.g., TEX. BUS. & COMM. CODE §§ 15.02-
15.04.  See generally, Goldschmid, Antitrust's Neglected Stepchild: A Proposal for Dealing With Restrictive Covenants Under 
Federal Law, 73 Colum. L. Rev. 1193 (1973); Annotation, Enforceability, Insofar as Restrictions Would Be Reasonable, of

Annotation, Validity Under the Federal Antitrust Laws (15 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq.), of Agreements Between Employers or Employer 
Associations Imposing Restrictions on Employment, 2 A.L.R. Fed. 839 (1969). In Texas, the validity of a restrictive covenant depends upon its reasonableness as to duration and area. Compare Martin v. 
Kidde Sales & Service, Inc., 496 S.W.2d 714 (Tex. Civ. App. -- Waco 1973, no writ) with T. E. Moor & Co. v. Hardcastle, 421

1003,1," Even if we agreed with the trial court's basic premise, that the provision of concession services to major league baseball was 
the relevant market, its failure to include as participants in that market baseball clubs which supply their own concessions very 
likely would compel reversal on that ground. The considerations which, in the view of the trial court, make the opportunity to 
provide concession services to a major league baseball club a uniquely desirable and profitable one in the eyes of a professional 
concessionaire must also appeal to the stadium or team owner-cum-entrepreneur. Thus, the exclusion from the relevant market 
of baseball teams which run their own concessions operations -- a pro-competitive influence in that market -- could not be 
supported even under the trial court's conceptualization. "
1028,1," According to the information supplied to us by the parties, there are presently 780 Dunkin Donuts shops in the United States, 
Canada and Puerto Rico. There are approximately 563 present franchisees, of whom 95 are multiple owners (with 2 to 10 
shops) accounting for some 263 shops. The number of former franchisees is not precisely known, but the best information 
received to date indicates that they number over 200. "
1030,2," During our discourse we will also confront the question of the extent to which the conventional law of tying applies to the 
alleged supplier tie-in involved in this case. Here, as in most contemporary fast food franchise cases, the franchisor is not the 
actual seller of the supplies with which the product is made, but instead requires that supplies be purchased from ""approved"" 
sources. This is not unlike the situation of the so-called TBA cases, and we will discuss their impact as well. "
1031,3," Originally, plaintiffs also asserted: (1) allegations of price-fixing under Section 1 of the Sherman Act; (2) claims of 
monopolization and attempt to monopolize under Section 2 of the Sherman Act; (3) violations of § 10(b) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10(b)(5) promulgated thereunder; (4) allegations of conspiracy to restrain trade in violation of 
Section 1 of the Sherman Act; (5) charges of price and service discrimination under section 2 of the Clayton Act, as amended by 
section 1 of the Robinson-Patman Act; (6) claims of breach of contract in that, inter alia, defendant allegedly failed to cure 
defects in the buildings leased from it to plaintiffs and did not use its business expertise and economic power for the mutual 
benefit of the parties as contractually promised; (7) allegations of violations of Sections 38 and 43(a) of the Lanham Act by 
defendant's false and fraudulent claims to and use of the sole right to the Dunkin Donuts trademark and logo; (8) charges of 
tortious interference by defendant with the reasonable business expectancies of plaintiffs; and (9) claims of illegal tying under § 
3 of the Clayton Act. These claims have either been abandoned or are not asserted as class action claims."
1031,4," The equipment sold by Dunkin Donuts in the equipment package is manufactured by various concerns. Thereafter, such 
concerns sell the separate pieces of equipment to Paramount Fountain and Restaurant Supply Company, Dunkin Donuts' sole 
authorized supplier for equipment, which coordinates the equipment package from items that meet Dunkin Donuts' 
specifications. When this is done, Paramount sells the entire package to Dunkin Donuts for resale by Dunkin Donuts to its 
franchisees. Some of the items comprising the equipment package are mixers, friers, proofers, cutting benches, refrigerators, 
finishing tables, doughnut machines, bins and racks and pans, doughnut cutters, knives, tea and coffee dispensers, and even 
ashtrays, bulletin boards, clipboards, stepladders and mop handles."
1031,5," Plaintiffs contend that had Dunkin Donuts provided the franchisees more time--at least ninety days--to obtain the equipment, 
they would have been able to purchase the equipment from sources other than Dunkin Donuts and at a considerably lower cost. 
Thus, although subsequent to November 1970, the defendant added a franchise fee and reduced the cost of the equipment 
package to the franchisee to $27,000, the plaintiffs contend that the $27,000 price exceeded the actual cost of $20,000 at which 
the franchisees could have obtained the items from other sources. "
1032,6, See Rader complaint paras. 53(p) to (t); Ungar complaint para. 31(E).
1032,7, Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for Class Action Determination at 35. 
1033,8," Plaintiffs allege that the signs usually cost the franchisee approximately $ 6,000, with Dunkin Donuts receiving a kickback of 
approximately $ 1800."
1033,9, Rader complaint paras. 53(aa) to (hh).
1033,10," The franchise agreement also requires each franchisee to pay $1,000 to defendant for a grand opening promotional 
advertising program. "
1034,11, Rader complaint para. 53(ii).
1034,12," In all of the Standard Franchise Agreements, the in-term and post-term covenants appear to overlap. That is, although the in-
term covenants would seem to apply only during the period in which a franchisee is operating a Dunkin Donuts store, the post-
term covenants, as written, likewise cover the in-term period plus further specified periods after the termination of the franchisor-
franchisee relationship."
1034,13," For example, the Standard Franchise Agreement that was in use during 1957-63 had an in-term restriction upon entering into 
similar businesses anywhere in the world. It also dictated that during the term and for 5 years after the term, no licensee could 
have an interest in a similar business in an area competitive to Dunkin Donuts. The minimum area which was deemed to be 
competitive was stated as 25 miles from any existing or prospective shop. In 1963 the Standard Franchise Agreement was 
modified to read that during the term no licensee could enter into a similar business at that location. (This was probably an error 
in drafting on the part of Dunkin Donuts as it would have been almost physically impossible for any franchisee to operate two 
distinct doughnut businesses at the same location at the same time.) The post-term restriction provision of the 1963 Agreement, 
much like that of the 1957 contract, proscribed licensees, during the term and for 5 years after termination, from engaging in 
businesses similar to Dunkin Donuts in areas within 25 miles of existing shops or such other areas as arbitrators would decide. 
In 1967 the Standard Franchise Agreement was again amended. The in-term restriction remained the same as that of the 1963 
contract. However, the post-term restriction was reduced to two years. The present form (described in the text) was adopted in 
1971. "
1035,14," Tying arrangements may be declared illegal under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1 (1958), or under Section 3 of 
the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 14 (1958), or under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45 (1958). Section 
3 of the Clayton Act provides in pertinent part: It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce . . . . to lease or make a sale or contract for sale of goods, wares, 
merchandise, machinery, supplies, or other commodities, whether patented or unpatented, . . . . or fix a price charged 
therefor, or discount from, or rebate upon, such price, on the condition, agreement, or understanding that the lessee or 
purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies, or other commodities of a 
competitor or competitors of the lessor or seller, where the effect of such lease, sale, or contract for sale or such condition, 
agreement, or understanding may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of 
commerce. Courts and commentators have noted several potential distinctions between the Sherman Act § 1 and Clayton Act § 3. First, the 
Clayton Act provision is confined to ties involving ""goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies or other commodities,"" while 
section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits every contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade. In this sense, the Sherman 
Act may be viewed as more encompassing than the Clayton Act. On the other hand, the Clayton Act provision has been 
interpreted as more prohibitive since it outlaws ties whose effect ""may be to substantially lessen competition, or tend to create a 
monopoly."" This language allows the courts to strike down the ties and anticompetitive practices in their incipiency, while the 
Sherman Act requires proof of actual restraint of trade. Most commentators, however, believe that section 3 of the Clayton Act 
and Section 1 of the Sherman Act should be interpreted similarly in regard to their prohibitions concerning tying. See, e.g., 
Pearson, Tying Arrangements and Antitrust Policy, 60 Nw.U.L.Rev. 626, 653 n. 96 (1965), Turner, The Validity of Tying 
Arrangements Under the Antitrust Laws, 72 Harv.L.Rev. 50, 58 (1958). The weight of authority is to the effect that § 3 applies only if both the tying and tied items are ""goods, wares, merchandise, 
machinery, supplies or other commodities."" See, e.g., Advance Business Systems and Supply Co. v. SCM Corp., 415 F.2d 55 
(4th Cir. 1969) (repair services not a ""commodity"" within § 3 of the Clayton Act); Columbia Broadcasting System v. Amana 
Refrigeration, Inc., 295 F.2d 375 (7th Cir. 1961) (advertising not a ""commodity"" within § 3 of the Clayton Act). The parties agree 
that the asserted tying items in this case, the trademark or license for the use of the proprietary mark ""Dunkin' Donuts"" and its 
logo, are not ""commodities"" under § 3 of the Clayton Act, and that the case must be viewed against the background of § 1 of the 
Sherman Act. The plaintiffs have thus abandoned the Clayton § 3 claim pleaded in their complaint. However, for the reasons 
indicated above, the Clayton Act cases are nonetheless helpful in construing the law. The cases arising under Section 5 of the 
Federal Trade Commission Act proscribing certain unfair methods of competition, e.g., F.T.C. v. Texaco, Inc., 393 U.S. 223, 21 "
1036,," L. Ed. 2d 394, 89 S. Ct. 429 (1968); Atlantic Refining Company v. F.T.C., 381 U.S. 357, 14 L. Ed. 2d 443, 85 S. Ct. 1498 (1965), 
will be discussed in a separate section of this opinion."
1036,15," See generally Austin, The Tying Arrangement: A Critique and Some New Thoughts, 1967 Wisc.L.Rev. 88 (1967) [hereinafter 
cited as Austin]; McCarthy, Trademark Franchising and Antitrust: The Trouble with Tie-Ins, 58 Calif.L.Rev. 1085 (1970) 
[hereinafter cited as McCarthy]; Pearson, Tying Arrangements and Antitrust Policy, 60 Nw.U.L.Rev. 626(1965) [hereinafter cited 
as Pearson]; Turner, The Validity of Tying Arrangements Under the Antitrust Laws, 72 Harv.L.Rev. 50 (1958) [hereinafter cited 
as Turner]; Comment, Franchises, Requirements Contracts and Tie-Ins: One Test for a Tangled Two, 74 Yale L.J. 691 (1965)."
1036,16," Mr. Justice White also notes that tie-ins may at times be beneficial to the market. He states that they may facilitate new entry 
into fields where established sellers have long predominated. They may make possible price cutting in otherwise non- "
1037,," competitively priced products because of the removal of fear of retaliation by the few other producers dealing in the market. They 
may protect the reputation of the tying product if failure to use the tied product in conjunction with it may cause it to function less 
effectively. Finally, if the tied and tying products are functionally related, tying arrangements may reduce costs through the 
savings realized in joint distribution and production."
1037,17," Accord, Pearson, supra note 15, at 635: ""There is no doubt that a strong strain of competitor protection runs through the 
current anti-trust law."" To buttress this contention, Pearson cites Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 8 L. Ed. 2d 
510, 82 S. Ct. 1502 (1962), where virtually the only anticompetitive effect discovered by the Court was that the questioned 
merger might enable Brown to sell shoes at a lower price, thus making it more difficult for Brown's competitors to compete. "
1038,18," The position of the plaintiffs in this lawsuit is that the tying arrangements which they attack constitute per se violations. If the 
practices asserted should not be so construed, the plaintiffs could still proceed upon the theory that the restraints are 
unreasonable. Section 1 of the Sherman Act literally proscribes ""every contract, combination . . . . or conspiracy, in restraint of 
trade or commerce among the several States."" However, the ""rule of reason"" announced in Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 
221 U.S. 1, 55 L. Ed. 619, 31 S. Ct. 502 (1911), limits the prohibitions of Section 1 to unreasonable restraints of trade. Inquiry 
pursuant to the rule of reason has traditionally proceeded according to guidelines formulated by Justice Brandeis in Chicago 
Board of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 62 L. Ed. 683, 38 S. Ct. 242 (1918); The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes 
competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question the court must 
ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the 
restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the evil 
believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant 
facts. This is not because a good intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but because 
knowledge of intent may help the court to interpret facts and to predict consequences. Proving that the alleged ties are an unreasonable restraint within the meaning of the ""rule of reason"" would require a 
complex determination of their effect upon competition and of the possible justifications for any adverse effect. Such an 
inquiry would necessitate a complicated and prolonged economic investigation into the franchising industry. At least with 
respect to the question of anticompetitive ties, plaintiffs have indicated their reliance upon the per se rule; they are 
apparently unwilling to undertake a ""rule of reason"" burden at trial. "
1039,19," Advertising was also alleged to be a tied product, but we reject this theory for the reasons discussed below. "
1040,20," Fortner represents an extension of Northern Pacific in this area. It is noteworthy, however, that in Northern Pacific the Court 
rejected the use by the Court in Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 97 L. Ed. 1277, 73 S. Ct. 872 
(1953), of the term ""monopolistic position"" which had suggested a return to the ""dominance"" test implied by the early Clayton Act 
cases. Northern Pacific undercut the language of Times-Picayune and reaffirmed the broader per se principles enunciated 
earlier in International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. 392, 92 L. Ed. 20, 68 S. Ct. 12 (1947): While there is some language in the Times-Picayune opinion which speaks of ""monopoly power"" or ""dominance"" over the 
tying product as a necessary precondition for application of the rule of per se unreasonableness to tying arrangements, we 
do not construe this general language as requiring anything more than sufficient economic power to impose an appreciable 
restraint on free competition in the tied product (assuming all the time, of course, that a ""not insubstantial"" amount of 
interstate commerce is affected)."
1040,356," U.S. at 11. See also Turner, supra note 15."
1040,21," In so holding, the majority rejected the contention of Mr. Justice Harlan that testimony should have been taken on: (1) the 
relative strength of Northern Pacific's land holding in the appropriate market; (2) the issue of ""uniqueness""; and (3) the extent to 
which the location of the lands, in fact, put Northern Pacific in a strategic position. "
1041,22," See also, e.g., Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Films Mfg. Co., 243 U.S. 502, 61 L. Ed. 871, 37 S. Ct. 416 (1917), 
Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Development Corp., 283 U.S. 27, 75 L. Ed. 819, 51 S. Ct. 334 (1931); Leitch Mfg. Co. v. 
Barber Co., 302 U.S. 458, 82 L. Ed. 371, 58 S. Ct. 288 (1938); Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., 314 U.S. 488, 86 L. Ed. 
363, 62 S. Ct. 402 (1942). The extension from the patent into the copyright area occurred in United States v. Paramount 
Pictures, Inc., 334 U.S. 131, 92 L. Ed. 1260, 68 S. Ct. 915 (1948), where the Court proscribed block booking of copyrighted films 
under § 1 of the Sherman Act. The Paramount Court presaged Loew's by implying that dominance in the tying product would be 
presumed on a mere showing that the tying product had some element of distinctiveness."
1041,23," In Fortner the alleged tie lay in an arrangement pursuant to which the purchaser was required to take a tied product--
prefabricated homes--as a condition of being allowed to purchase the tying product--credit--from U.S. Steel Homes Credit Corp., 
a subsidiary of United States Steel. The affidavit of Fortner's president stated that competitors of U.S. Steel sold prefabricated 
houses and built conventional homes for at least $400 less than U.S. Steel's price for comparable models. Since in a freely 
competitive situation buyers would not accept a tying arrangement obligating them to buy a tied product at a price higher than 
the going market rate, this substantial price differential with respect to the tied product (prefabricated houses) in itself suggested 
to the court that U.S. Steel had some special economic power in the credit market. In addition, Fortner's president stated that he 
accepted the tying condition on respondents' loan solely because the offer to provide 100% financing, lending an amount equal 
to the full purchase price of the land to be acquired, was unusually and uniquely advantageous to him; he found that no similar 
financing was available to his corporation on such inexpensive terms from any other source during the 1959-1962 period. 
Although the Court noted that market power cannot be inferred simply because the kind of financing terms offered by a lending 
company are unique and ""unusual,"" it observed that uniquely and unusually advantageous terms can reflect a creditor's 
distinctive economic advantage over his competitors. The grant of summary judgment for the defendant was reversed. "
1042,24," In so holding, we are not unmindful of the recent decision in Capital Temporaries, Inc. v. The Olsten Corp., 365 F. Supp. 888 
(D. Conn. 1973), aff'd, 506 F.2d 658, 1974 Trade Cas. P 74,220 (2d Cir. 1974). That case dealt with a trademarked franchise 
system engaged in the business of supplying temporary personnel to customers for ""white collar"" jobs. Plaintiff, after operating 
an Olsten's franchise for several years, repudiated the franchise agreement and in an antitrust suit asserted, inter alia, that in 
order to obtain an Olsten white collar franchise, he was also required to establish and operate a blue collar operation under the 
""Handy Andy Labor"" trademark. He alleged in his complaint that this constituted an illegal tie, the tying product being ""Olsten,"" 
and the tied product being ""Handy Andy Labor."" For reasons discussed in the text, infra, the district court granted summary 
judgment for the defendant on the tie-in claim and the court of appeals affirmed. We address here only that portion of the opinion 
of Judge Mulligan for the court of appeals rejecting the contention that, since the service franchised to the plaintiff was 
trademarked, the economic power of the defendant must be presumed. Judge Mulligan first noted that no Supreme Court decision has gone any further than to presume economic power in those 
cases where the tying product is patented or copyrighted. He then observed that the trademark or name ""merely identifies the 
franchisor,"" and pointed out that there was no suggestion in the record of any uniqueness in the techniques of Olsten that could 
not be offered by others. Indeed, in Judge Mulligan's view, ""since almost everything sold today is trademarked,"" the 
consequence of adopting the franchisee's position would be ""troublesome."" Recognizing that Siegel II and Warriner Hermetics, 
Inc. v. Copeland Refrigeration Corp., 463 F.2d 1002 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1086, 34 L. Ed. 2d 673, 93 S. Ct. 688 
(1972) hold contra, Judge Mulligan also cited to the decision in Susser v. Carvel Corp., 332 F.2d 505 (2d Cir. 1964), cert. 
dismissed, 381 U.S. 125 (1965), which held that a trademark qua trademark is not a sufficient indication of dominance over the 
tying product to qualify for per se treatment under Northern Pacific. We do not believe that Capital Temporaries is apposite here, for it appears unquestionable that, at a trial on the merits, the 
trademark, franchise system and logo of Dunkin Donuts will emerge as far more distinctive than that of Olsten's. In any event, 
we prefer to follow the Siegel view on the impact of a trademark as proof of requisite economic power. See also Redd v. Shell 
Oil Co., 1974-2 Trade Cas. P 75,390 (D.Utah 1974); Falls Church Bratwursthaus v. Bratwursthaus Management Corp., 354 F. 
Supp. 1237 (E.D. Va. 1973). We note too that the Susser dominance test to which Judge Mulligan adverts was completely 
undercut by the Supreme Court's decision in the Fortner case. "
1043,25," Dunkin Donuts is not a manufacturer of the equipment package required to operate a Dunkin Donuts shop. However, Dunkin 
Donuts sells to its franchisees the equipment assembled by Paramount Equipment Company of Providence, Rhode Island, and 
sold by Paramount to Dunkin Donuts. Hence, there is no split ownership with respect to equipment."
1043,26," The practice followed by Dunkin Donuts with respect to requiring that its franchisees purchase supplies only through approved 
suppliers is not uncommon in the franchising industry. See McCarthy, supra note 15. However, in the franchise cases the courts 
have not to date focused upon the question of whether traditional tying law applies where there is split ownership of the tying 
and the tied products. In Siegel II the problem did not arise because the Chicken Delight franchisees apparently purchased the 
supplies directly from the franchisor, a practice difficult for a national franchisor to duplicate today in view of distribution 
problems.  Belliston v. Texaco, Inc., 455 F.2d 175 (10th Cir. 1972), and Lah v. Shell Oil Co., 50 F.R.D. 198 (S.D. Ohio 1970) 
were Sherman Act § 1 cases dealing with claims that oil companies had tied to their franchise the requirement that the service "
1044,," station owners purchase TBA (Belliston) or certain unwanted trading stamps and games (Lah). Neither court applied a Northern 
Pacific or Fortner type analysis to the facts, utilizing instead the analysis from the Supreme Court TBA cases. See generally 9 
Von Kalinowski, Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulation § 65.05[2][b] (1972). However, neither did the Belliston and Lah courts 
focus on the split ownership question, and their facts are notably different from those at bar."

1044,28," In the Texaco opinion the Court diluted the Atlantic Refining coercion standard. This is an important point and will be 
discussed infra. "
1045,29," The approved supplier system is generally justified as a vehicle for the franchisor to retain sufficient quality control to protect 
the integrity of his trademark and franchise system, and the defendant has sought to justify it on that basis here. Thus, it 
contends, there is no illegality in a system of quality control based on approved suppliers, especially where franchisees are 
provided a means for securing approval of additional suppliers. Although in the particulars already noted the plaintiffs have 
contended that the Dunkin Donuts quality control system is a sham, the quality control defense may well prove formidable at trial 
and, in any event, will be discussed in greater detail below."
1045,30," A franchisor's requirement that a franchisee purchase his supplies only from designated third parties has sometimes been 
characterized as an exclusive dealing arrangement. See Von Kalinowski, supra note 26, at § 65.05[B][2]; Susser v. Carvel Corp., 
332 F.2d 505 (2d Cir. 1964), cert. dismissed, 381 U.S. 125, 14 L. Ed. 2d 284, 85 S. Ct. 1364 (1965); Barby's Frosted Foods, Inc. 
v. McDonald's Corp., 1973-2 Trade Cas. P 74,622 (D. N.J. 1973). Exclusive dealing contracts are not judged by a per se rule. 
See Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320, 5 L. Ed. 2d 580, 81 S. Ct. 623 (1961). Susser has, however, been 
undercut by Fortner and by Siegel. We believe that the exclusive dealing analogy is inappropriate, and that the plaintiffs' 
approved supplier claim is most appropriately dealt with in tie-in terms. Accord, Comment, Franchisees, Requirements Contracts 
and Tie-Ins: One Test for a Tangled Two, 74 Yale L.J. 691, 697-98 (1965)."
1045,31," To succeed in a claim of unlawful tying, the plaintiff must prove that the tying product was unavailable without the tied product. 
What is at issue here is the question of proof. In this respect, the issues are similar to those discussed in the portions of this 
opinion dealing with proof of the use of economic power. Hence, they will not be separately addressed. "
1046,32," Similar in import to Siegel II were Redd v. Shell Oil Co., 1974-2 Trade Cas. P 75,390 (D. Utah 1974); Falls Church

Enterprises, Inc., 1971 Trade Cas. P 73,780 (N.D. Ill. 1971)."
1046,33," One court has, however, rendered the interpretation that ""a contractual provision is necessarily coercive."" In re 7-Eleven

'persuasion,' 'exposition' or 'argument' are fair characterizations."" 335 U.S. at 316-17. "
1049,35," Thus, Mr. Justice Frankfurter found: The restraints imposed by the paragraphs appellants seek to have suspended are properly described by the terms 
""exposition,"" ""persuasion"" and ""argument."" So long as these paragraphs remain in effect and so long as there is no 
comparable decree enjoining their substance against General Motors and GMAC, Ford and CIT cannot do without risk of 
violating the consent decree that which General Motors and GMAC are free to do. . . . . Thus the conditions have been 
fulfilled which entitled Ford and CIT to suspension of the restraints imposed by those terms of the decree."

1054,38," In the wake of Texaco and the views expressed by Mr. Justice White in Perma Life Mufflers with respect to equality of 
bargaining power (see pp. 110-111 infra), it is helpful to keep in mind the fact that the present case does not arise in a vacuum, 
but rather against the backdrop of a staggering increase in the franchising business in the United States in recent years. 
According to the Franchise Opportunities Handbook published by the United States Department of Commerce in 1972, 
franchised businesses in the United States accounted for over $131 billion in annual sales in 1971, representing 35% of retail 
sales and 13% of the Gross National Product. Published figures show that 1972 sales in the fast-food franchising industry alone 
were $5.8 billion dollars. McDonald's led the way with 1.03 billion dollars; Kentucky Fried Chicken's sales were approximately $1 
billion and Dunkin Donuts' sales for that year were $120 million. At least 400,000 businessmen are franchisees. FEDERAL 
TRADE COMMISSION, STAFF REPORT ON LEGAL PROBLEMS IN CONNECTION WITH FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS 6 
(1969) [hereinafter cited as FTC STAFF REPORT]. For franchising statistics, see Hearings on S. 2507 and S. 2321 Before the "
1055,," Subcomm. on Antitrust and Monopoly of the Senate Comm. on the Judiciary, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., ser. 1, pt. 1 (1967) 
[hereinafter cited as Hearings]. More recent statistics would doubtless reflect significant volume increases. Franchising has been described as the latest frontier for the independent businessman, a vehicle which enables the ""little guy"" to 
enter business despite the trend towards oligopoly which casts a shadow upon the free enterprise system. For an excellent 
discussion of modern franchising see McCarthy, supra note 15, at 1086-1093. Instead of going it alone, a person of modest 
means desiring to go into business can associate himself with a large concern and market something that is proven, 
standardized and well advertised. The fact that each franchisee is investing his own money leads to a high degree of motivation 
for him to work hard to be successful. According to E. Lewis and R. Hancock, THE FRANCHISE METHOD OF DISTRIBUTION 
71, n. 2 (1975), most franchisees work long hard hours, often as many as 60 to 80 hours per week. Franchising is also of benefit 
to the franchisor, who is able to maintain a large number of consumer outlets to distribute his products without having to invest 
his own money in a retail operation. Notwithstanding its supposed benefits to the franchisee, it is plain that abuses have appeared which have prompted United 
States Senate hearings (see Hearings, supra) and the enactment of at least one state law to protect franchisees. SeeCal. Corp. 
Code § 31005 (West Supp. 1971). McCarthy describes some of the ""inequities of franchising"" as follows: The franchisee, by definition not wise in the ways of business, is presented with a form contract prepared for the franchisor 
by a battery of highly skilled attorneys. This contract is usually presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, and few of them are 
negotiated in the legal sense. Relying on the glowing representations of the franchisor's agent, the franchisee readily signs 
without much perusal of the contract terms. What the terms really mean becomes apparent only after the franchisee 
launches into the daily operation of his new business. Most franchise contracts can be legally characterized as a skeleton of a trademark license fleshed out with the many duties 
and restrictions imposed upon the franchisee. The failure to comply with any of these terms generally gives the franchisor 
the power to terminate, often with disastrous results for the franchisee's personal investment. . . . . McCarthy, supra note 15, at 1090 (footnotes omitted). Focusing on the present case and the named plaintiffs involved, we believe that it is fair to conclude that few if any of them, 
whether represented by counsel or not, had sophistication or resources to match that of Dunkin Donuts in negotiating a new 
franchise. As the class action discovery in this case demonstrates, today's franchisees come from all walks of life. For instance, 
before becoming Dunkin Donuts franchisees, the following named plaintiffs pursued the following occupations: Mr. Ungar was an 
accountant; Mr. Giannuzzi was a butcher; Mr. Cerajewski was a teacher; Mr. Pallantios was a luncheonette operator; Mr. Burwell 
was a railroad conductor; Mr. Daratony was an automotive designer; Mr. Hudock was a dockman and part-time baker; Mr. 
Wainrober was a salesman; the Olivieris were beauticians; Mr. Thomae was a barber; and Mr. Rader worked for an electronics 
company and in a doughnut shop part-time. An affidavit filed by defendant reveals that the franchisee roster also includes 
individuals who have pursued such diverse occupations as insurance agent, Antarctic scientist, self-employed plasterer, 
gasoline station operator and ophthalmologist. Several of the named plaintiffs are multiple franchisees. Pallantios, for instance, operates 9 Dunkin Donuts shops and Rader 
operates 5. Information supplied to us by counsel for plaintiffs indicates that there may be as many as 95 multi-unit franchisees 
operating from 2 to 10 stores each. Although it might conceivably create an issue for trial, we suspect preliminarily (and 
tentatively) that none of the franchisees has as yet reached a position of bargaining equality with Dunkin Donuts. Accordingly, 
we need not be concerned in this opinion with the import of Justice White's remarks in Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International 
Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134, [20 L. Ed. 2d 982, 88 S. Ct. 1981] (1968), respecting equality of bargaining power. "
1056,39," Mr. Justice White reasoned that in the first hypothetical case, B should recover from A; that in the second case A should not 
recover from B; and that in the third case, where D and E were competitors, if judge or jury found the parties equally responsible 
for the conduct which caused injury, D's recovery under § 4 should be denied for failure of proof that E was the more substantial 
cause of the injury. Justice White concluded with the observation that: No simple formula can encompass the infinite variety of possible situations. Generally speaking, however, I would deny 
recovery where plaintiff and defendant bear substantially equal responsibility for injury resulting to one of them but permit 
recovery in favor of the one less responsible where one is more responsible than the other. This rule would simply pose the 
issue of causation in particularized form. There will be little mystery as to what evidence would be relevant proof: facts as to 
the relative responsibility for originating, negotiating, and implementing the scheme; evidence as to who might reasonably 
have been expected to benefit from the provision or conduct making the scheme illegal under § 1; proof of whether one 
party attempted to terminate the arrangement and encountered resistance or counter-measures from the other; facts 
showing who ultimately profited or suffered from the arrangement."

1057,41," The willing but ignorant buyer must be deemed indirectly and subjectively coerced since, in the defendant's parlance, a 
rational man would presumably not take an uneconomic tie unless he was coerced or deceived. "
1058,42," Company policy may be reflected in similar representations or misrepresentations to all purchasers. It is thus appropriate to 
note here the words of Judge Harris in making the original class certification in Siegel I: To acknowledge defendants' position at this point would be, in effect, an emasculation of the vitality and pliability of the 
amended rule, as recognized by Judge Edmund Palmieri when he stated that ""While there may be different kinds of 
misrepresentations alleged with respect to different plaintiffs, including some oral misrepresentations, and while such 
factors might have led to dismissal of a class action under the old rule, e.g., Speed v. Transamerica Corp., 5 F.R.D. 56 (D. 
Del. 1945); Gilbert v. Clark, 13 F.R.D. 498 (D. Mass. 1952), the new Rule 23 provides the flexibility to permit this action to 
proceed. It may very well develop that the misrepresentations made to the purchasers were in fact very similar, if not 
identical. If, on the other hand, the facts should reveal in the course of the pre-trial development of the case that the alleged 
misrepresentations were so varied as to render the action unmanageable ( Fed. R. Civ. P 23(c)(1)), the Court can order 
that the class allegations be stricken and that the action proceed on behalf of the named plaintiffs alone. Fed. R. Civ. P 
23(c)(1) and 23(d)(4)."" Kronenberg v. Hotel Governor Clinton, Inc., 41 F.R.D. 42, 45 (S.D.N.Y. 1966). "

1060,44," Although the parties have not addressed the issue, we perceive in the facts as developed during class action discovery 
possible instances where the necessity of taking the tied product did not appear until after the franchise sale was completed. In 
our view, this does not inveigh against a tying claim with respect to such instances if the situation resulted from company policy 
or where a threat of franchise termination existed for failure to comply. We note that the plaintiffs allege that Dunkin Donuts 
possesses broad termination leverage under the franchise agreement. There is at least one case holding that temporal notions 
must give way to reality. See MDC Data Centers, Inc. v. International Business Machines Corp., 342 F. Supp. 502 (E.D. Pa. 
1972), where Judge Masterson rejected the argument that no tie-in claim could be asserted because there was no mention of 
any service requirement (the alleged tied product) until after the IBM computers had been delivered and installed. Judge 
Masterson held that supplying an inoperable product which becomes useful only upon acceptance of another product or service 
can constitute an unlawful tie-in."
1060,45, Judge McLaren also states therein that coercion is not a necessary element of a Sherman Act § 1 action. 
1061,46," In Siegel II this defense was labelled the ""marketing identity"" justification."
1061,47," Indeed, defendant points to the Consent Order in In re AAMCO Automatic Transmission, Inc., F.T.C. File No. 681 0141, 
reported at 1972 CCH FTC Complaints P 20,094, where the Federal Trade Commission entered a Consent Order instituting an 
approved supplier system for AAMCO franchisees' purchases of automotive parts, equipment and merchandise."
1061,48," Professor McCarthy takes a strong stand on the issue: But when does quality control justify tying supply sources to the licensed trademark? The answer is: hardly ever. Effective 
quality control in no way requires trademark owners to designate their franchisees' suppliers. Both antitrust law and 
trademark law are satisfied by the simple alternative of quality specifications that allow the franchisee to buy from 
whomever he chooses, so long as he meets the quality standards. The only possible exception is the rare case where it is 
impossible to draft meaningful specifications for quality. The quality specification alternative will, of course, put a greater burden on the franchisor than if he could simply designate 
sources and supervise quality at the supply source. But mere convenience has never been a defense to charges of 
restraint of trade. Congress and the courts have decided that the benefits of competition are worth the price of "
1062,," inconvenience and extra expense. The social and economic benefits of allowing the franchisee freedom of choice are worth 
the price of greater burdens on the franchisor in achieving quality control: ""[The] central policy of both § 1 of the Sherman 
Act and § 3 of the Clayton Act [is] against contracts which take away freedom of purchasers to buy in an open market."" The franchisor who ties franchisees into designated supply sources merely to get a kick-back on sales to his franchisees is 
deserving of little sympathy: he is merely trying to deceive them as to the true extent of their royalty payments. McCarthy, supra note 15, at 1117-1118 (footnotes omitted)."
1062,49," In Siegel II, the court held that a tie-in cannot be justified as an accounting device for compensation for a trademark license."
1062,50," The new business justification stems from the decision of Judge Van Dusen in United States v. Jerrold Electronics Corp., 187 
F. Supp. 545 (E.D. Pa. 1960), aff'd per curiam, 365 U.S. 567 (1961). Jerrold was a pioneer in the business of selling systems of 
electronic equipment to relay television to rural areas where TV signals could not be effectively received with conventional 
apparatus. It sold its equipment only on the condition that the buyers agreed to accept an installation and servicing contract. The 
court noted that the company, which was the pioneer in the industry, had sold approximately 75% of the CATV systems in the 
country. The court also noted that the community television system industry in the country might have been retarded or 
destroyed by consumer reaction to a rash of early system failures, and that Jerrold lacked the resources to survive initial 
setbacks. It found that the tie-ins were necessary to prevent system failures in light of the intricacy of the new system and the 
training necessary for proper servicing, which made it impossible for Jerrold to prevent failures by supplying purchasers with 
instructions alone. Judge Van Dusen evaluated the tying agreements dealing with maintenance and repair services under § 1 of the Sherman Act 
and the agreements covering purchases of replacement parts and full systems under Section 3 of the Clayton Act. He held that 
even though the tied service agreements constituted a per se violation under Northern Pacific, under the unique facts of the case 
an injustice would be done by blindly accepting the per se rule. He thereupon fashioned a limited exception where the tie was 
necessary to preserve and enhance the goodwill of a new and small industry. Moreover, Judge Van Dusen held that the 
defendant had the burden of proof as to the exception. While Jerrold has frequently been cited as an exception to the per se rule 
and interpreted as an effort to establish a ""rule of reason"" in tying cases, which would in turn necessitate exhaustive economic 
inquiry in every tying case, it is in actuality a very discrete exception applying only to new and small industries. See generally 
Comment, The Use of Tie-Ins in New Industries, 70 Yale L.J. 804 (1961). "
1063,51," The first case involving a restrictive covenant that has come to our attention is Dyer's Case, Y.B. Mich. 2 Hen. 5, f. 5, pl. 26 
(C.P. 1414). However, the most celebrated decision on the legality of common-law restraints came almost three hundred years 
later in Mitchel v. Reynolds, 1 P. Wms. 181, 24 Eng. Rep. 347 (Q.B. 1711). There the court balanced the social utility of certain 
types of restraints against their possible deleterious effects upon the promisor and the public, formulating a test of 
""reasonableness"" under which such undertakings were to be examined. This approach has carried forward to the present day, 
albeit somewhat modified in form. For an excellent discussion of the common law antecedents of the principles governing the 
legality of restrictive covenants, see Blake, Employee Agreements Not to Compete, 73 Harv. L. Rev. 625 (1960)."
1063,52," This is an abbreviation of the Restatement's more detailed formulation which lists some additional factors not mentioned 
herein. However, the above test is the one most often utilized by the courts who have reduced the standards to just three."
1063,53," See, e.g., Capital Temporaries, Inc. v. The Olsten Corp., 506 F.2d 658 (2d Cir. 1974); Bradford v. New York Times Co., 501 
F.2d 51 (2d Cir. 1974); Water Services, Inc. v. Tesco Chemicals, Inc., 410 F.2d 163, 167 n. 4 (5th Cir. 1969). The position 
expressed by the courts in these decisions is that restrictive covenants do not rise to the status of Sherman Act violations and 
that they are generally treated under state law."
1063,54," To support this conclusion, Professor Goldschmid quotes the famous opinion of Judge Taft (later Chief Justice) in United 
States v. Addyston Pipe and Steel Co., 85 F. 271, 279 (6th Cir. 1898), aff'd, 175 U.S. 211, 44 L. Ed. 136, 20 S. Ct. 96 (1899), to 
the effect that the design of the Sherman Act was only to alter the legal consequences of improper contracts: The effect of the act of 1890 is to render such contracts unlawful in an affirmative or positive sense, and punishable as a 
misdemeanor, and to create a right of civil action for damages in favor of those injured thereby, and a civil remedy by 
injunction in favor of both private persons and the public against the execution of such contracts and the maintenance of 
such trade restraints. Moreover, the author points to Chief Justice White's summation of the common law from Mitchel v. Reynolds in Standard Oil Co. 
v. United States, 221 U.S. 1, 59, 55 L. Ed. 619, 31 S. Ct. 502 (1911): Let us consider the language of the first and second sections [of the Sherman Act], guided by the principle that where 
words are employed in a statute which had at the time a well-known meaning at common law or in the law of this country 
they are presumed to have been used in that sense . . . .. . . . . . . . . The context manifests that the statute was drawn in the light of the existing practical conception of the law of restraint 
of trade . . . .. "

1064,55," AMI is the only decision which, to our knowledge, has determined the legality of a restrictive covenant under the antitrust laws, 
although there are other cases which approach the analysis utilized in AMI tangentially. See Hecht v. Pro-Football, Inc., 144 U.S. 
App. D.C. 56, 444 F.2d 931 (1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1047, 30 L. Ed. 2d 736, 92 S. Ct. 701 (1972); United States v. 
Chicago Tribune--New York News Syndicate, Inc., 309 F. Supp. 1301 (S.D.N.Y. 1970)."
1064,56," In its market effects and manner of operation, Judge Garth determined that Holiday Inns' radius letter policy was closely 
analogous to the horizontal allocation of territories condemned in United States v. Topco Associates, 405 U.S. 596, 31 L. Ed. 2d 
515, 92 S. Ct. 1126 (1972). In Topco, 25 small supermarket chains formed a wholly-owned cooperative association (""Topco 
Associates"") to serve as a purchasing agent for its members and to distribute Topco-brand products. Applications for 
membership in the co-operative went through approval procedures of the Board of Directors and of 75% of the existing 
members. If the closest existing member, or any member within 100 miles of the applicant, voted against approval, however, 
then an 80% vote was required. The Supreme Court held the Topco system illegal per se because these practices operated as 
""a veto of sorts"" over actual and potential intra-brand competition. Although the individual Holiday Inns did not combine to create 
and own Holiday Inns, Inc., as the Topco franchisees created and owned Topco Associates, Judge Garth found that through the 
radius letter technique Holiday Inns franchisees had utilized the parent Holiday Inns, Inc. as the Topco franchisees utilized the 
""parent"" Topco Associates--to allocate territories horizontally."
1064,57," Judge Garth also held that regardless of the market effect of the above practices standing alone, their combined effect 
resulted in a horizontal allocation of territories violative of the antitrust laws because such practices cumulatively insulated any 
given Holiday Inn from unwanted competition from any other Holiday Inn or from any non-Holiday Inn owned by a Holiday Inns 
franchisee."
1064,58," The non-Holiday Inn clause provided: . . . . that licensee will not, directly or indirectly, own any interest in, operate, or be in any manner connected with or 
associated with, any inn, hotel or motel, during the period of this license, except Holiday Inns."
1064,365, F. Supp. at 1081. 
1065,59," One reason for selecting this market definition of the line of commerce was that it took into account the national referral 
system, a device which is important to Holiday Inns' success and whose protection was the alleged justification for the restrictive 
covenant. Moreover, in selecting the geographic market, Judge Garth found that AMI owned or had applied for franchises in the 
entire United States except for the Far West, and had been unable to deal with other hotel chains operating nationally. Also, he 
cited evidence that another Holiday Inns franchisee, Albert Pick, had been precluded by Holiday Inns from maintaining his own 
independent chain of non-Holiday Inns. "
1067,60," As evidence of this fact, defendant quotes the deposition testimony of David P. Segal, Dunkin Donuts' Senior Vice President: Q. When the franchisee purchases an equipment package--let's go back to pre-November 1, 1970--does he have to take 
the whole package? A. I think that the package of equipment was part of the franchise, was often varied, especially when we were dealing with a 
multi-unit operator who already had certain items of equipment and it was not necessary for him to repurchase equipment. And also, there were occasions where, for some reason, a franchisee would want or have preference for some other 
equipment that might have been acceptable to the company. And I am thinking specifically about--I know the proof box, 
which is a pretty substantial part of the package. A number of operators preferred certain other equipment which was 
approved by us, and we were certainly--we certainly cooperated with them when they wanted to buy that other equipment. Q. Are you talking about another make proof box or something besides a proof box? A. A different make, different manufacturer of the equipment. There were alternative items of equipment that could do the same job, in our opinion. They were always allowed to replace 
equipment of that kind. (Segal dep. at 180-81)."
1067,61," Defendant may not be successful in franchising a shop before it is ready to open or before the franchisee has completed his 
training and, in such circumstance, may open and operate the shop itself before a franchisee assumes possession. Moreover, 
there are two other ways in which franchisees commonly acquire their outlets other than as a new store. One occurs when a 
franchisee determines to sell his franchise; in this circumstance the purchaser will typically enter into a franchise agreement with 
defendant, enter into a purchase and sale agreement with the existing franchisee for the equipment, signs, inventory, etc., and 
either assume the seller's lease or enter into a new lease or sublease with defendant. Dunkin Donuts does not participate in the 
sale of equipment, signs and inventory at all. The other manner in which a franchisee may acquire a ""used"" store occurs when 
one franchisee cedes his store to Dunkin Donuts, which then refranchises it to a new franchisee. In this type of transaction, the 
documentation also typically consists of a franchise agreement, a purchase and sale agreement and a lease or sublease. "
1068,62," In a memorandum prepared by Vermeire to provide answers to policy questions most frequently asked by franchisees, the 
following question and answer appear: Q. Can the franchisee buy a portion or all of his equipment elsewhere to start his franchise? How about after he has 
opened? A. No--must purchase all original equipment on equipment list from us. . . . . He can, however, purchase a vitality orange 
juice dispenser and approved soft drink machines. All other additional equipment must have written permission by Dunkin 
Donuts of America, Vice-President. (Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2 to Vermeire deposition.) Vermeire testified during the deposition that the answer contained in this quotation 
was the Dunkin Donuts policy (Vermeire dep. at 36, 70); that this policy was given him by a senior vice-president and other high 
officers of Dunkin Donuts (Vermeire dep. at 63); and that this policy had been the consistent policy and practice of Dunkin 
Donuts until November 1, 1970 (Vermeire dep. at 56-59, 62-63, 68-70, 72, 55-58). Vermeire testified during the deposition as 
follows: "
1069,," Q. My question is: If he asks, you tell him that it is a part of the package, the whole package, and he says: ""Well, I want to 
be a Dunkin Donut franchisee but I want to buy the equipment from another source."" You said this occasionally has come up. What do you tell him? Can he become a Dunkin Donut franchisee and yet buy the 
equipment from another source? A. He cannot, for the reasons I mentioned, prior to June 1970. Defendant objects to plaintiffs' utilization of Mr. Vermeire's testimony to establish proof of the existence of a uniform policy on the 
part of Dunkin Donuts to coerce the franchisees into buying their equipment from Dunkin Donuts.  Rather, defendant contends 
that Mr. Vermeire's testimony reflects an effort on the part of Dunkin Donuts only to formulate a uniform policy. Defendant states 
that Mr. Vermeire was assigned certain questions for which he proposed answers to be discussed at the Franchise Review 
Session. His replies, according to defendant, were suggestions only and, in fact, were never adopted. "
1070,63," Defendant notes an exception to the extent that some franchisees have been permitted to buy supplies from any source. 
Plaintiff Daratony, for example, testified that while he generally uses only approved supplies, he has used unapproved 
shortening because of its lower price (Daratony dep. at 120). He continued to use the unapproved shortening until it was no 
longer available. According to defendant, the deposition testimony of Daratony shows that at no time during his use of the 
unapproved shortening did anyone from Dunkin Donuts ever object to its use or tell Daratony that he was not permitted to use it. 
(Daratony dep. at 121). Also, plaintiff Hudock testified that he often used non-printed (non-approved) paper goods in his shop, 
even when printed goods were available, because non-printed items cost less. (Hudock dep. at 112). According to defendant, 
Hudock continues to use four non-printed items and has not received any threats of disenfranchisement (Hudock dep. at 113-
114). In addition, Hudock has consistently used unapproved shortening for the last five years, and has received no threats or 
criticisms from Dunkin Donuts (Hudock dep. at 128-129). Finally, according to defendant, plaintiff Hegazi is now permitted to 
purchase unapproved shortening (Hegazi dep. at 95)."
1070,64," Defendant points out that while 13 suppliers made new shop opening contributions, 19 did not."
1070,65," Answer to Interrogatory 3 of the Rader class action interrogatories at 12-15. The list of Dunkin Donuts approved suppliers 
includes some industry giants like Pillsbury and General Foods as well as some lesser known companies such as Victor Coffee 
Co., Orchard Products and Sheri Cup Co."
1070,66," See Rader Answer to Interrogatory 6, at 23-30c, listing 95 manufacturers and 19 franchisees owning 41 franchises to whom 
specifications had been sent."
1070,67," For example, Rader is one of the franchisees who claims to have attempted to secure approval for new suppliers (Rader dep. 
at 98-101). Halper Brothers, upon Rader's application, was approved as a supplier of paper goods. Burwell, another named 
plaintiff franchisee, sought to have a new supplier approved. Defendant points to the fact that Michigan Fast Foods, upon 
Burwell's application, became an approved supplier for paper goods, jellies, flour and shortening in 1961. Finally, Hudock, along "
1071,," with several other plaintiffs in this action, was successful in obtaining approval for an additional paper supplier, Michigan 
Popcorn."
1071,68," Cerajewski is another one of the franchisees who has been very active in attempting to secure approval for two new suppliers-
-the Karp Company and the Conrad Kern Company. At the time of this writing, neither company has become an approved 
supply vendor. Rader is another franchisee who attempted to secure approval for a new supplier, Globe, which was met with 
refusal. Finally, Hudock forwarded jelly samples to Dunkin Donuts for approval in 1969. To Hudock's knowledge, the jelly 
manufacturer never attempted to contact Dunkin Donuts directly, and Hudock never received either approval or disapproval for 
those jellies. (Hudock dep. at 107-108)."
1071,69," For example, defendant states that during their years as Dunkin Donuts franchisees, Pallantios, Daratony, Hegazi and 
Wainrober never sought approval for a new supplier. (Pallantios Answer to Interrogatory 19; Daratony Answer to Interrogatory 
19; Hegazi dep. at 103; Wainrober dep. at 101)."
1071,70," Plaintiffs also rely upon: (a) a letter dated April 16, 1970, from Popsicle Industries to Robert Rosenberg, President of Dunkin 
Donuts, in which Dunkin Donuts is collecting $7,286.61 in rebates as a result of opening sales to the franchisees (Exhibit ""Q""); 
(b) inter-office correspondence dated November 24, 1970, from Thomas R. Schwarz, an employee of Dunkin Donuts, in which 
he discusses the defendant's policy of selecting suppliers and determining the amount of contribution (Exhibit ""V""); (c) a 
schedule of supplier contributions along with a form letter sent to all suppliers from Al Bennet, Director of Marketing for Dunkin 
Donuts. (Plaintiffs infer from this communication that if the suppliers desire to continue supplying the franchisees, they must 
accede to the demands of Dunkin Donuts in the form of a grand opening contribution); and (d) confidential interoffice 
correspondence, dated January 13, 1971, from Thomas Schwarz in which he estimates that suppliers will contribute $75,000 in 
1971. See also plaintiffs' Exhibit ""DD,"" comprised of inter-office correspondence dated November 4, 1971, from Len Geller in 
reference to Middleby Co., a supplier who would not pay their $250 per store contribution until they did $2500 in sales from each 
franchise operation in which they gave the $250 contribution. With the attached letter, dated October 28, 1971, is a dunning "
1072,," statement which was sent to Middleby in the amount of $3000 for grand opening contributions, notwithstanding defendant's 
alleged new policy of not trying to force suppliers to contribute if this would increase the cost to the franchisee."
1072,71," Defendant refutes Cerajewski's testimony and states that the time lapse involved in Karp's request for approval as a mix 
supplier was, in fact, only seven months--from February 1971 to September 1971. Dunkin Donuts avers that the request for 
approval was received in February; Karp's first samples were tested in March; further samples were received in May; these were 
tested again in August, and results available in September indicated the presence of salmonella and pseudomonas in Karp's 
product. Disapproval was promptly communicated to Karp who continued to make subsequent efforts to gain Dunkin Donuts' 
approval."
1072,72," With regard to the Conrad Kern Company, defendant asserts that a request for approval was first communicated to Dunkin 
Donuts in November 1972. It is Dunkin Donuts' assertion, based on communications in its files, that the delay in sending 
specifications was due, in great part, to Kern's actions and a mixup in the U.S. Postal Service. Furthermore, defendant contends that the record of Dunkin Donuts' experience with the Karp Company and the Conrad Kern 
Company is obviously not dispositive as to its relations with all franchisees and manufacturers who ever sought approval."
1072,73," Two other named plaintiffs have expressed similar viewpoints. Burwell recites one discussion he had with his district sales 
manager as constituting a request for specifications. Burwell, at one time, was using a product that was not approved in his store 
and, in response to a statement by his district sales manager that he should remove the product, Burwell asked, ""I can try to get 
it approved, who do I go to?"" In response, the district sales manager is claimed to have stated, ""believe me, we tried it and you 
are not going to get it approved--forget it."" (Burwell dep. at 153). Hudock, another franchisee, was successful in obtaining 
approval for an additional paper goods supplier. As Hudock described the approval process, ""finally, after many meetings and 
arguments and fighting, Dunkin finally agreed to let Michigan Popcorn handle the paper goods."" (Hudock dep. at 109)."
1072,74," Defendant decries plaintiffs' use of this report ""in a vacuum."" It contends that Dr. Bolaffi's deposition testimony qualifies and 
explains the language cited from the report. "
1073,75, Defendant also asserts a quality control justification for this alleged tie-in practice.
1073,76," Defendant cites other instances in which franchisees either raised no questions regarding sign purchases or indicated that the 
system of purchase recommended by Dunkin Donuts was attractive to them. For instance, Pallantios, until he negotiated for his 
fourth Dunkin Donuts shop, was seemingly happy to purchase the signs from or through Dunkin Donuts. Also, it was Giannuzzi's 
wish that Dunkin Donuts put together the entire package for him, including the signs. (Giannuzzi dep. at 34)."
1073,77," The Advisory Council is a group of elected franchisees and company representatives in each area of the country which meets 
regularly to discuss grievances, exchange ideas and provide a channel for communication by franchisees directly to the 
executive level of the franchisor."
1073,78," Plaintiffs cite other instances in which Dunkin Donuts brought subtle pressure to bear upon a franchisee in order to ""convince"" 
him to order his signs from or through Dunkin Donuts. For instance, although Hegazi had a friend in the sign business and 
wanted to purchase from him, he accepted Dunkin Donuts' explanation that Dunkin Donuts had a manufacturer who made signs 
especially for it. (Hegazi dep. at 29). Also, Mr. Swahn testified that he had a relative in the sign business and mentioned getting 
a price from him to Dunkin Donuts. According to Swahn, defendant's response was that it had a sign company who had the 
molds and it couldn't possibly be done cheaper than what they could do it for. (Swahn dep. at 57-58). "
1074,79," According to the plaintiffs, this letter shows that the franchisee signs a security agreement as a result of his purchasing the 
signs from Cummings for $6,3050.00, which also includes Dunkin Donuts' ""commission"" of $1,850.00."
1074,80," Plaintiffs particularly emphasize an inter-office memorandum, dated April 5, 1968, from Robert Rosenberg, President of 
Dunkin Donuts (Exhibit ""II""). This memorandum shows that the signs were transferred to the equipment package because the 
sign companies did not want to include in their financing agreement with the franchisee the $1800 rebate to Dunkin Donuts. 
Also, Rosenberg reiterates the defendant's policy of charging a fixed mark-up on the signs regardless of the number of signs a 
franchisee purchased. According to plaintiffs, this memorandum clearly shows that the defendant would only deal with those sign 
companies who would give Dunkin Donuts the $1800 kickback."
1074,81," Defendant claims that Vermeire's testimony, as cited by the plaintiffs regarding the alleged sign tie-in, is misleading. Read as a 
whole, Dunkin Donuts argues, Vermeire's deposition supports its contention that the franchisees were free to purchase signs 
after 1966 from any sign company they wished. Moreover, Vermeire testified that Dunkin Donuts no longer engaged in the 
practice of receiving commissions from sign vendors after September 1969 (Vermeire dep. at 75-78)."
1074,82," For example, the current form of agreement (Exhibit 1-13 to Rader Answer to Interrogatory 1) states:"
1074,2," . DUNKIN' DONUTS agrees: A. To select the location for the DUNKIN' DONUTS SHOP; or, in the event the FRANCHISEE makes his own selection, to 
approve the location if it meets the standards employed by DUNKIN' DONUTS in selecting other locations at the time; B. At the FRANCHISEE's request, to develop and lease the DUNKIN' DONUTS SHOP, through a subsidiary, to the 
FRANCHISEE; or, in the event the DUNKIN' DONUTS SHOP is under development on the date this Agreement is 
executed, to lease the DUNKIN' DONUTS SHOP, through a subsidiary, to the FRANCHISEE; C. To provide, in the event the FRANCHISEE elects to develop the DUNKIN' DONUTS SHOP, the plans and specifications 
and the benefit of DUNKIN' DONUTS' experience in the design and construction of DUNKIN' DONUTS SHOPS."
1074,83," On page 1 of the booklet is the following statement: It may come as a surprise to many that the Company views its real estate involvement as a poor financial venture and only 
utilizes leasing or real estate ownership as a necessary means to open additional shops and enable Dunkin' Donuts to 
grow. Our policy has been to avoid real estate involvement where possible and, in fact, because of limited funds in a 
restrictive money market, we encourage all new and existing owners who want additional shops to find and finance their 
own realty. This would ease the financial burden on the Company and would also enable the franchise owner to save the 
rent mark-up and percentage override for himself. "
1075,," (Exhibit ""J"" to Def. First Class Action Brief and Def. Post-Argument Brief, at 31)."
1075,84," Rosenberg stated that ""it has never been the policy or practice of Dunkin' Donuts to require franchisees to lease or sub-lease 
premises from Dunkin' Donuts."" (Rosenberg Affidavit, para. 14, 15)."
1075,85," Defendant also points out that with regard to a second piece of property on Forest Avenue, Dunkin Donuts, after 
unsuccessfully attempting to negotiate with the landlord, told Giannuzzi that if he desired he should negotiate on his own. 
Giannuzzi obtained an option on the land, but the landlord refused to lease the property to Giannuzzi unless Dunkin Donuts was 
also on the lease. Before Giannuzzi could arrange the deal, his option expired. Giannuzzi is allegedly working on a location in 
another area at present. He plans to put his second shop in a building that is presently being used as a bowling alley in a 
shopping center. According to Giannuzzi, Dunkin Donuts' only desire with regard to that location is that it be given an option to 
take over the Dunkin Donuts shop in the event that Giannuzzi ever determines to abandon the business he establishes there. 
Although he is making all of his own arrangements for the shop, Giannuzzi testified at his deposition that he has received neither 
threats nor harassment from Dunkin Donuts (Giannuzzi dep. at 63-72)."
1075,86," Similarly, according to defendant, Daratony was interested in being a lessee rather than an owner because being an owner 
would be too costly for him (Daratony dep. at 21). "
1077,86," a Professor Kaplan, on the other hand, believes that the basis for the typicality requirement is the notion that the representative 
ought to be squarely aligned in interest with the represented group. Kaplan, Continuing Work of the Civil Committee: 1966 
Amendments of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (I), 81 Harv. L. Rev. 356 (1967). "
1078,87," In addition, we believe that the adequacy inquiry requires a finding that the representative party and his attorney can be 
expected to prosecute the action vigorously. As Judge Gurfein noted in Wolfson v. Solomon, 54 F.R.D. 584 (S.D.N.Y. 1972), in 
many cases such as this the possibility of recovering attorney's fees will provide the sole stimulus for the enforcement of the 
class rights. See also Escott v. Barchris Construction Corp., 340 F.2d 731, 733 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 816 (1965). We 
believe that in this case the possibility of recovering attorney's fees is sufficient stimulus for the enforcement of class rights."
1078,87," a In Free World, Judge Weinfeld found the interests of present and former franchisees to be adverse because of the concern of 
present dealers that Alfa Romeo remain in business to assure their source of supply as opposed to the sole interest of the 
plaintiff in that case, a former franchisee, in recovering damages. Judge Weinfeld found the threat to the defendant's survival in 
the face of the class action suit to be real. Whether or not there is any threat to the survival of Dunkin Donuts here is not known; 
but in this case the suit is led by present franchisees who are active in the Dunkin Donuts franchisee association. "
1079,88," Cf. Wetzel v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 508 F.2d 239(3d Cir.,1975) (where a former employee, assumedly not entitled to 
reinstatement, was held to be an adequate representative of a class of past and present employees alleging discriminatory 
employment practices); Mersay v. First Republic Corp., 43 F.R.D. 465 (S.D.N.Y. 1968) (where a plaintiff was permitted to serve 
as the class representative in a securities act suit even though it is possible that he was personally barred from recovery as an 
insider)."
1079,89," Possible conflicts may arise if there is selective enforcement of restrictive covenants or adverseness between franchisees 
who have highly successful stores and marginal operators to whom the presence of a new coffee and doughnut shop in 
proximity to their franchised outlet may be damaging. These are but possibilities as of now. However, we will be alert to them as 
the case develops, having in mind the great flexibility to modify and mold afforded by Rule 23."
1079,89," a So that we might adequately assess the potential representative status of the named plaintiffs, we have reviewed their status 
as franchisees. It appears that all are present franchisees with the following exceptions. Rader is a former franchisee with 
respect to the Elizabeth, N.J. store, one of his several Dunkin Donuts shops. Similarly, Pallantios, who still has several operating 
Dunkin Donuts franchises, is a former franchisee with respect to one shop in Hamilton, N.J. The Olivieris are former franchisees 
with respect to two of their three shops, in Penn Hills and Versailles, Pa. Finally, Ungar and Miller, while ""present"" franchisees 
when their suit was instituted on January 12, 1972, became former franchisees after termination of their franchise agreement in 
September 1974. "
1080,90," The damage issues can be tried through the vehicle of separate damage proceedings, LoCicero v. Humble Oil & Refining 
Co., 52 F.R.D. 28, 30-31 (E.D. La. 1971). Additionally, the separation procedure may be further conducted by using a master to 
calculate damages of individual class members.  Brennan v. Midwestern United Life Ins. Co., 286 F. Supp. 702, 729-30 (N.D. 
Ind. 1968); Connecticut Importing Co. v. Frankfort Distilleries, Inc., 42 F. Supp. 225, 226-27 (D. Conn. 1940). "
1081,91," In Hawkins v. Holiday Inns, Inc., C.A. No. C-72-217 (W.D. Tenn., Feb. 3, 1975), Judge McRae, in declaring a class of Holiday 
Inns franchisees in a suit alleging violations of the Sherman Act and breaches of fiduciary duty, found it inappropriate even to 
examine the statute of limitations issue in connection with class action determination on the grounds that it was an affirmative 
defense on which the defendant had the burden of proof."
1081,92," As will be seen, we do not certify the ""used store"" claims as defined more precisely below."
1081,92," a Even if the decision in Capital Temporaries, Inc. v. The Olsten Corp., 365 F. Supp. 888 (D. Conn. 1973), aff'd, 506 F.2d 658 
1974 Trade Cas. P 75,303 (2d Cir. 1974), see note 24 supra, is correct in its assumption that a trademark does not enable the 
court to presume the requisite economic power in the tying product, the issue of the extent of economic power inhering in the 
Dunkin Donuts trademark, logo and franchise system would still constitute a common question for trial. "
1082,93," They rely in this regard upon a passage in Beefy Trail, Inc. v. Beefy King International, Inc., 348 F. Supp. 799 (M.D. Fla. 
1972), wherein Judge Young indicated that there might be liability: . . . . under the circumstances where the franchisor by an intentional course of conduct seeks to circumvent the antitrust 
laws concerning tying arrangements by requiring a franchisee to purchase a restaurant and its equipment previously 
established with the conscious purpose of avoiding the rationale of Chicken Delight."
1082,94," See, e.g., Halverson v. Convenient Food Mart, Inc., 69 F.R.D. 331 (N.D. Ill., 1974); Smith v. Denny's Restaurants, Inc., 62 
F.R.D. 459 (N.D. Cal. 1974); Abercrombie v. Lum's Inc., 345 F. Supp. 387 (S.D. Fla. 1972). These cases, although supportive of 
the individual coercion doctrine, do seem to assume the viability of a leasing arrangement as constituting a cognizable tied 
product under the antitrust laws. "
1083,95," We do not separately certify the plaintiffs' claims with respect to the construction costs markup and the lease override. Dunkin 
Donuts' alleged overreaching with respect to the construction costs markup may well provide the plaintiffs with an additional item 
of damage if they succeed on liability. So perhaps may the lease override, although defendant will doubtless argue that that sum 
is really an additional franchise fee and, therefore, a set off against any tying damages. We need not resolve those issues here."
1083,96," The manner of alleged misuse is described in detail above. We believe the claim is properly characterized as one for breach 
of contract rather than breach of fiduciary duty. "
1084,97, There was relatively little discovery on this issue. 
1085,98," The relief sought with respect to the restrictive covenants arises under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201 
(1959). One of the purposes behind declaratory judgments is to avoid multiplicity and circuity of actions.  Smith v. Transit Cas. 
Co., 281 F. Supp. 661 (E.D. Tex. 1968), aff'd, 410 F.2d 210 (5th Cir. 1969); Savini v. Sheriff of Nassau County, 209 F. Supp. 946 
(E.D.N.Y. 1962); Stout v. Grain Dealers Mut. Ins. Co., 201 F. Supp. 647 (M.D.N.C. 1962), aff'd, 307 F.2d 521 (4th Cir. 1962). 
The granting of declaratory relief is proper where the judgment will serve a useful purpose in clarifying and settling the legal 
relations at issue, or when it will terminate and afford relief from uncertainty, insecurity and controversy giving rise to the 
proceedings.  Maryland Cas. Co. v. Rosen, 445 F.2d 1012 (2d Cir. 1971). Furthermore, declaratory judgments contemplate a 
pragmatic approach to determination of legal relations in controversy between interested parties.  St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. 
v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 357 F.2d 315 (10th Cir. 1966); Brunswick Corp. v. Outboard Marine Corp., 297 F. Supp. 373 (E.D. 
Wis. 1969). We are not certain as to whether the defendant wishes to interpose objection to the propriety of declaratory relief. 
We note at this juncture only that we do not resolve that matter, which has not been sufficiently briefed, herein."
1085,99," Plaintiffs also argue that the restrictive covenants are per se violations of the Sherman Act under the analysis of United States 
v. Topco Associates, 405 U.S. 596, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515, 92 S. Ct. 1126 (1972), due to the existence of Dunkin Donuts' owned 
""company stores."" Thus, they allege that horizontal territoriality is rampant. Topco, however, is not applicable here since there is 
no evidence in the record that the ""company stores"" are anything more than a temporary device employed by Dunkin Donuts 
until the location is sold to a new franchisee. Hence, the type of restrictions imposed by Dunkin Donuts in the restrictive 
covenants are vertical in nature and cannot constitute a per se violation of the antitrust laws. "
1086,100," While there is some variation in the terms of the various form agreements used by defendant, the in-term covenants do not 
vary sufficiently to affect our findings on the certifiability of the antitrust claim. "
1087,101," Actually, the subject considerations are stated to be relevant to predominance as well as superiority, but in the context of this 
case we believe them to be more germane to superiority. Hence, we discuss them only here."
1087,102," Professor Moore comments that the second sentence of (b)(3) does not purport to set up a series of factors on which 
findings must themselves be made: Analysis of these various items should not lead to an exaggerated impression of their materiality. None of the suggested 
factors should be determinative of the grant or denial of class status; they are simply pertinent details to be checked, the 
presence or absence of which may reflect on the overall wisdom of allowing a class suit. . . . ."
1087,3," B Moore, supra para. 23.45[4.-0], at 23-851. "
1088,120," a Some cases have held that the larger the individual class member's damages, the less need there is for class treatment, 
particularly in antitrust actions where the plaintiff can obtain an award of attorneys' fees. See, e.g., Caceres v. International Air 
Transport Association, 46 F.R.D. 89 (S.D.N.Y. 1969), appeal dismissed, 422 F.2d 141 (2d Cir. 1970). While we cannot gainsay 
that the individual plaintiff's damage claims here may be substantial, so too is the scope of the litigation. When all of the factors 
here are placed on the balancing scale, it strongly tips towards a superiority finding."
1088,103," In addition to the present suits and E.B.E., Inc. v. Dunkin' Donuts of America, Inc., 387 F. Supp 737 (E.D. Mich., 1974), we 
note the existence of four other franchise antitrust actions which have been filed against Dunkin Donuts: Greene v. Dunkin 
Donuts, Inc., C.A. No. 3-5820-D (N.D. Texas, filed April 26, 1972); North Carolina ex rel. Robert Morgan v. Dunkin Donuts, Inc., 
No. 73-CVS-2680 (General Court of Justice of Wake County, Superior Court Division, filed Mar. 19, 1973) [also known as 
Zezulka]; Workman v. Dunkin Donuts, Inc., No. 74-173 (E.D. Pa., filed Jan. 23, 1974); Pasquarello v. Dunkin Donuts, Inc., No. 
72-1424 (E.D. Pa., filed July 19, 1972). Greene was a suit filed on behalf of all present and past franchisees in Texas charging, 
inter alia, monopolization and attempt to monopolize, tying and exclusive dealing, and pendent fraud claims. Zezulka was an 
action initiated by the Attorney General of North Carolina seeking injunctive relief under North Carolina's ""Little Sherman Act,"" 
N.C. Gen. Stats. 75, for unfair methods of competition and unfair deceptive acts and practices in the conduct of trade. Nine 
franchisees (one of whom was Zezulka) intervened as a purported class of franchisees. In the action by the franchisees in 
Zezulka, as well as in Greene, the courts relied on the individual coercion doctrine to deny class treatment. Pasquarello was 
brought in this court by Messrs. German and Manta, counsel for plaintiff Ungar herein. That case has been dismissed. Workman 
was brought in this court on behalf of a New Jersey franchisee by counsel not connected in any way with the present litigation. 
The parties have agreed to leave Workman in abeyance, pending the outcome of this motion. "
1089,104," There is a suggestion in portions of defendant's briefs and in some of the recent franchise class action motion opinions, e.g., 
Lah v. Shell Oil Co., 50 F.R.D. 198 (S.D. Ohio 1970), p. 103 supra, that class action certification is generally inappropriate in 
antitrust cases. Defendant suggests in one of its briefs that, at the very least, class certification is inappropriate in any but 
horizontal restraint antitrust cases. We find no evidence to support that conclusion. The history of class action litigation is heavily 
laden with antitrust cases. Siegel, the benchmark in the franchise field, was a class action case. Although the recent weight of 
authority in franchise cases is to deny class certification, that is so because of the acceptance of the individual coercion doctrine. 
Professor Moore points out the appropriateness (and limitations) of class treatment in antitrust cases, 3B Moore, supra para. 
23.45 [2], at 23-759-762. The discussion comes under the heading of predominance, and Professor Moore notes that the 
question of predominance is ""more formidable in the numerous (b)(3) suits based on fraudulent dealings in securities [than in 
antitrust cases]."" Id. at 23-762. The recent flurry of class certifications in antitrust cases, cited throughout this opinion, confirms 
this view. The significant point is that class certification turns not upon whether we are faced with an antitrust case, a securities 
fraud case, or some other particular area of substantive law, but upon compliance with Rule 23(b)(3)."
1089,105," However, we do not certify the equipment and sign tie-in claims in those instances where franchisees purchased used and 
equipped stores from either former franchisees or from Dunkin Donuts. Neither do we certify equipment and sign tie claims with 
respect to stores already equipped when purchased from Dunkin Donuts."
1089,106," However, we do not certify the equipment and sign tie-in claims in those instances where franchisees purchased used and 
equipped stores from either former franchisees or from Dunkin' Donuts. Neither do we certify equipment and sign tie claims with 
respect to stores already equipped when purchased from Dunkin Donuts. "
1095,1," These are two separate and independent actions which have not been formally consolidated for trial but are being treated 
together for purposes of discovery and pretrial motions."
1095,2, Claims involving real estate monopoly and the tying of TBA products have been abandoned.
1095,3," It is hornbook law that individual action does not violate Sherman Act § 1. The statute clearly requires concerted action in the 
form of a contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade. As an example, this concerted action could take the form of a 
vertical tie-in contract between a buyer and seller or a horizontal combination or conspiracy among competitors. Thus, as 
between a lessor and lessee a contract would exist. But where this relationship does not exist, concerted action must be shown 
another way -- such as through an agreement among suppliers or lessors."
1095,4," As for Parisi, the lessee, a contract exists with Exxon, the lessor, while as with Getty and Shell no such relationship exists."
1095,5," This is hardly accidental. Messrs. Brown and Berger are experienced and learned attorneys in the field of antitrust litigation. 
Rather than inadvertence, the use of ""interdependent conscious parallelism"" is a deliberately employed strategy. "
1097,6," Summary judgment will be granted solely on a question of law. No facts are in dispute. The caveats of Poller, supra at 473; viz., 
difficulty in proof of conspiracy, motive or intent are inapplicable. Cf., White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 9 L. Ed. 2d 
738, 83 S. Ct. 696 (1963); Goldinger v. Boron Oil Co., 375 F. Supp. 400, 412 (W.D. Pa. 1974); Cal. Distributing Co. v. Bay 
Distributors, Inc., 337 F. Supp. 1154, 1161 (M.D. Fla. 1971); Record Club of America, Inc., v. Columbia Broadcasting System, 
Inc., 310 F. Supp. 1241, 1245-46 (E.D. Pa. 1970). Not only is it proper to use summary judgment to resolve questions of law, 
National Bank of Commerce of San Antonio v. United States, 369 F. Supp. 990 (W.D. Tex. 1973), aff'd, 491 F.2d 1271 (5th Cir. 
1974), but courts should not flinch from their duty to decide a legal issue on summary judgment simply because as here, the 
legal issue may be difficult or uncertain.  Housing Authority of Omaha, Neb. v. United States Housing Authority, 54 F.R.D. 402, 
404 (D. Neb. 1972), rev'd on other grounds, 468 F.2d 1 (8th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 927, 35 L. Ed. 2d 588, 93 S. Ct. 
1360 (1973); Perfect Photo Inc. v. Sentiff, 205 F. Supp. 574, 575 (E.D. Pa. 1962)."
1097,7," It is arguable that the standing issues are threshold questions and should be answered first. However, I find that these theories 
propounded by Getty and Shell would not justify summary judgment. I do not consider the deposition testimony of plaintiffs 
concerning a conclusion of law to be dispositive. Moreover, plaintiffs would not be expected to understand the legal ramifications 
or even be aware of the activities of the defendants which may have injured them. Their deposition testimony, therefore, to the 
effect that they were ""not harmed in any way"" or they had ""no complaint"" against Getty or Shell is inconclusive."
1097,8," Hereafter when concerted action in the form of conspiracy or combination is referred to, only the word conspiracy will be used."
1097,9," See 5 Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1202."
1097,10, Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).
1097,11," Plaintiffs have also cited Moore v. Matthews & Co., supra, a case involving both tying and parallelism. Moore is 
distinguishable. In that case defendants engaged in a tie-in as a response to an invitation to conspire. Thus the invitation to 
conspire and the response to so engage in a tie-in supported a Sherman Act § 1 violation without regard to interdependent 
conscious parallelism. "
1098,12," In the opinion, Judge Zirpoli alludes to this fact although he does so in the converse: While there is circumstantial evidence from which one might infer that National had such advance notice, [of the USG price 
exception policy], failure to establish such advance notice is not fatal to plaintiffs' claim that defendants were actively 
participating in an agreement or conspiracy to fix or stabilize prices. [citation omitted].  326 F. Supp. at 316."
1098,13,"  ""Such interdependent conscious parallel action may well constitute a tacit understanding . . .. "
1098,326, F. Supp at 316. (emphasis added). 
1099,14," Of course, monopolization is a separate violation under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. 15 U.S.C. § 2. However, the fact that 
prices were later lowered by the defendants is another factor of circumstantial evidence pointing toward a conspiracy. Unlike a 
price increase, a price decrease could not be explained away by the increased cost of advertising expenses."
1099,15," Turner, The Definition of Agreement Under the Sherman Act; Conscious Parallelism and Refusals to Deal, 75 Harv. L. Rev. 
655 663-73 (1962)."
1099,16," Because antitrust litigation is complex, it requires an appreciation of economics as well as a thoughtful application of the facts 
to the law. In this vein, it is dangerous to resort to labels and phrases as a substitute for analysis. It is not ""conscious parallelism"" 
and the addition of the word ""interdependent"" to that phrase which is meaningful. Rather, a factual analysis of cases is 
mandated. A useful opinion which has attempted to deal with facts and issues is Overseas Motors Co. v. Import Motors, Ltd., 
Inc., supra. "
1100,17," The concerted action claim, in any case, encompasses an individual claim. Cf., Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts 
Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 142, 20 L. Ed. 2d 982, 88 S. Ct. 1981 (1968). "
1102,18," If the plaintiff can show that the tying product has sufficient economic power to restrain free competition in the tied product and 
affects a not insubstantial amount of commerce, then the tie-in will be presumed illegal without an elaborate inquiry into the 
precise harm caused.  Fortner Enterprises, Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., infra at 498-99; Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United 
States, 356 U.S. 1, 5-6, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545, 78 S. Ct. 514 (1958); International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. 392, 396, 92 L. 
Ed. 20, 68 S. Ct. 12 (1947). On the other hand, if the plaintiff cannot meet the requirements for the per se rule, the case can still 
be decided under the rule of reason. Using the latter course, inquiry is made under the general standards of the Sherman Act 
with a thorough examination into the purposes and effects of the practices involved.  Fortner, supra at 500. To be successful 
under the rule of reason the plaintiff must prove that the complained of practices are an unreasonable restraint on commerce 
and consequently have an anticompetitive effect. See, e.g., United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U.S. 365, 368, 18 L. 
Ed. 2d 1249, 87 S. Ct. 1856 (1967); Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, supra at 5-6; Worthen Bank & Trust Co. v. National 
Bank Americard, Inc., 485 F.2d 119, 125-26 (8th Cir. 1973)."
1102,19," Exxon has alluded to passages in the depositions where Parisi stated that he did not attempt to buy gasoline elsewhere. From 
this Exxon assumes that neither was Parisi compelled nor Exxon gasoline unwanted. Such an inference of non-compulsion flies 
in the face of Parisi's statement that he was afraid of repercussions. I wouldn't be around. I wouldn't be there long if I did that [attempt to purchase non Exxon gasoline for his station]. Parisi deposition p. 144. If Parisi feared losing his station by purchasing gasoline other than Exxon, then coercion is manifest. Cf. United States v. Arnold, 
Schwinn & Co., 388 U.S. 365, 372, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1249, 87 S. Ct. 1856 . (1967). "

Court has repeatedly treated the two terms as merely verbal variants of the same concept. The matter is not quite as clear as 
GTE urges, but the Supreme Court does use the term ""dissolution"" to refer, inter alia, to the remedy of divestiture. In Schine, the 
Court referred to the relief granted in the prior case of Crescent Amusement Co. -- a decree that the corporate exhibitors divest 
themselves of any stock or any other interest in any other corporate defendant or affiliated corporation -- as ""dissolution of the 
combination of the affiliated corporations."" 334 U.S. at 127. In Crescent Amusement Co. itself, the Court referred to the same 
relief as ""divestiture."" 323 U.S. at 188, 189. Similarly, in United States v. Paramount Pictures, 334 U.S. 131, 92 L. Ed. 1260, 68 
S. Ct. 915 (1948), the Court referred to the relief granted by the district court as ""dissolution"" at one point, 334 U.S. at 151, and

includes but is not restricted to the remedy of divestiture. When an unlawful combination results not from stock or asset 
ownership but rather from adherence to an agreement or contract then it may be ""dissolved"" by cancellation or by an injunction

1259,29," For a detailed discussion of the legislative history of § 12, see United States v. National City Lines, 334 U.S. 573, 581-88, 92 
L. Ed. 1584, 68 S. Ct. 1169 (1948). "
1261,30," The opinions in neither of these cases give any indication that the respective plaintiffs there built the kind of substantial 
evidentiary record on the questions of venue, jurisdiction and service of process that NUE and Zenith have compiled in the 
instant matters. Accordingly, the O.S.C. case and the Bankamerica case are distinguishable on this ground as well."
1261,31," It should be noted, however, that many of the cases cited, for example, the Cannon decision itself, do not apply in the instant 
actions. "
1263,32," The strong public policy favoring disclosure to grand juries undoubtedly was a factor in both of these cases. See United States 
v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 94 S. Ct. 3090, 41 L. Ed. 2d 1039 (1974). The impact of that policy on both decisions does not, however, 
invalidate the court's analyses of the applicability of § 12."
1263,33," The Court also noted that Cannon involved a manufacturer and seller, and Scophony involved a holding company. I do not 
find that this distinction is crucial in an antitrust proceeding under § 12. "
1264,34," I decline to follow the Schwartzbaum decision insofar as it holds that a parent must supervise the day-to-day operations of a 
subsidiary before venue is proper for the parent. Such a rule would revive the Cannon doctrine and, since Scophony, that 
doctrine does not apply to § 12 antitrust proceedings. "
1266,35," The court held that defendant alien corporations were amenable to suit under the Alien Venue Statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1391(d). 
Section 12 of the Clayton Act, of course, does not apply in patent infringement actions."
1266,36," This corporation should not be confused with Hitachi Limited, a corporate defendant in both the NUE and Zenith actions. "
1268,37," I am well aware of my responsibility to make individual determinations as to venue for each of the moving defendant 
corporations. I have in fact made such determinations. With one exception, all of the moving defendants fall so squarely within 
the scope of § 12's ""transacting business"" requirement that it is clearly appropriate to make a single general finding of proper 
venue for them. The lone exception, where the existence of proper venue is at least arguable, is Matsushita Electronics 
Corporation (MEC), a subsidiary of MEI. MEC, the Zenith complaint alleges, ""is engaged in the development, manufacture and 
sale of a variety of electronic components used in the manufacture of television receivers and other consumer and industrial 
electronic products, including television picture tubes, solid state and micro-electronic circuitry devices."" (para. 7) It thus does not 
fit neatly into the manufacturing/trading/sales pattern that embraces all of the other moving defendants and their subsidiary or 
affiliated corporations. Nevertheless, on the basis of its numerous close connections with, and important contribution to, the 
manufacturing, trading and sales system of the other Matsushita defendants, I find that venue is proper as to MEC as well."
1268,38," In both actions, plaintiffs have alleged causes of action under the Antidumping Act of 1916, 15 U.S.C. § 72. Defendants have 
argued that even if venue is proper under § 12 of the other counts of the two complaints, it is not proper for the counts arising 
under 15 U.S.C. § 72. I see no need, however, to rule on the validity of this argument. It would be senseless for this court to 
bifurcate these two exceedingly complex antitrust cases by dismissing or transferring the antidumping counts while retaining the "
1269,," antitrust counts since the facts underlying both sets of issues are essentially the same. If ever cases cried out for the exercise of 
pendent venue, these two antitrust actions do. Accordingly, in the interest of judicial economy, this court will retain jurisdiction 
over the antidumping counts under the doctrine of pendent venue. See Dolly Toy Co. v. Bankcroft-Rellim Corp., 97 F. Supp. 531, 
536 (S.D. N.Y. 1951); Ferguson v. Ford Motor Co., 77 F. Supp. 425, 436 (S.D. N.Y. 1948). "
1270,39," These issues include the constitutionality of the Alien Venue Statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1391(d), the waiver of jurisdictional defenses 
by the moving defendants in the Zenith action, the injury theory of jurisdiction as approved in Honeywell, Inc. v. Metz 
Apparatewerke, 509 F.2d 1137 (7th Cir., 1975) (Slip Opinion), and the propriety of service of process pursuant to the 
Pennsylvania long-arm statute, 42 P.S. § 8301 et seq., and the New Jersey long-arm statute, formerly R.R. 4:4-4(d), now R.R. 
4:4-4(c)(1). "

1278,4," The plaintiff would ascribe to any anti-competitive purpose the characterization of ""evil motive."""
1278,5," The plaintiff implies that an intent to reduce competition is a ""forbidden restraint "".  This quite clearly was not the Supreme 
Court's view.  Nearly all franchise, exclusive dealing and real estate agreements reduce and intend to reduce competition.  
Certainly, it cannot be maintained that these transactions are violative of antitrust without more having been shown or 
established. "
1282,1," Jurisdiction has been in dispute since defendant's answer was filed.  Much of the voluminous discovery proceedings has been 
concerned with the issue of subject matter jurisdiction raised by defendant's answer and prior motion for summary judgment."
1282,2," Defendant's prior motion for summary judgment was denied by Opinion and Order of March 14, 1972. "
1284,3," See Civil Action No. 69-271, Western District of Pennsylvania, filed August 29, 1969.  It also appears that a receiver was 
appointed by the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County at No. 3432, July Term, 1969, in a state dissolution proceedings."
1284,4, The annual gross sales of both Hempfield stores were approximately as follows: Year Gross Sales

1285,5," For a complete list of the categories of merchandise sold by both the Hempfield stores and the Kresge department stores, see 
Defendant's Interrogatories to Plaintiff (First Set), question 7."
1285,6," Plaintiff contends that, as interpreted by defendant, being ""competitive"" in price meant meeting the lowest price of all its 
competitors on each and every item which Hempfield sold.  As explained by counsel for plaintiff at oral argument: Assume 
Hempfield has three competitors -- A, B, and C in the trading area in which it operates, all of whom sell item X and item Y.  
Competitor A sells item X for $0.49 and item Y for $0.51; competitor B sells both items for $0.50; and competitor C sells item X 
for $0.51 and item Y for $0.49.  Plaintiff states that Hempfield was required to sell both items for $0.49, the lowest price charged 
by any competitor. Hempfield alleges that this requirement was used to increase the volume of sales at defendant's stores by 
making Hempfield a ""loss leader."" See United States v. Food and Grocery Bureau of Southern California, 43 F. Supp. 974 (S.D. 
Calif. 1942), aff'd, 139 F.2d 973, 974 (9th Cir. 1943)."

for summary judgment."

1286,10," Id., question 14. "
1288,11," Direct restraints are restraints imposed upon goods or services in the flow of interstate commerce and under the in commerce 
theory, substantial effect is presumed as a matter of law. Indirect restraints are those imposed on business or goods which 
merely compete with goods that flow in interstate commerce. See 1 Von Kalinowski, Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulations, P 
5.01(2) and cases cited therein (hereinafter referred to as Von Kalinowski). "
1289,12," In Land v. Dollar, supra, the complaint alleged that members of the U.S. Maritime Commission were unlawfully holding shares 
of Dollar stock under a claim that the stock belonged to the United States.  The district court dismissed the action on the ground 
that the United States was immune from suit.  In affirming a reversal of that dismissal, the Supreme Court said: ""[Although] as a general rule the District Court would have authority to consider questions of jurisdiction on the basis of 
affidavits as well as pleadings, this is the type of case where the question of jurisdiction is dependent on decision of the 
merits."" 330 U.S., at 735. The court reasoned that since if the plaintiffs were to prevail on either of their theories on the merits, i.e., that the Commission 
was without authority to acquire the shares or that the contract was simply a pledge of the shares rather than an outright transfer "
1290,," then they would also prevail on the jurisdictional issue. See Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp Paving Co., Inc., 419 U.S. 186, n. 10, 95 S. 
Ct. 392, 42 L. Ed. 2d 378 (1974) (Douglas, J., dissenting)."
1290,13," The McBeath court distinguished Page v. Work, supra, where the use of the summary judgment procedure was upheld 
because the court there had abundant evidence before it on which to base its decision.  Thus, it appears the McBeath decision 
was premised on the fact that the district court lacked a sufficiently complete record on which to base its determination of 
jurisdiction. "
1291,*," The words ""effect"" and ""affect"" are frequently used interchangeably. "
1292,14," In Las Vegas Merchant Plumbers, supra, government counsel argued that it was plainly not for the jury to decide whether a 
per se violation has the necessary effect upon commerce; that price fixing at any level necessarily affects interstate commerce 
as a matter of law and that the law conclusively presumes such an effect.  The Ninth Circuit answered this argument: ""Assuming 
an 'in commerce' situation, we can agree.  But when the 'affect' on commerce theory is presented, it is clearly a question of fact 
whether wholly intrastate activities affect interstate commerce in a manner proscribed by the Sherman Act. After this question is 
decided, then the per se doctrine may well apply."" 210 F.2d at 748. See also U.S. v. Richter Concrete Corp., supra. "
1293,15," Plaintiff's allegation that Hempfield made $400,000 worth of annual purchases in interstate commerce by direct shipments 
from out of state suppliers is challenged by defendant on several grounds: first, Anthony C. Polito, the sole shareholder of 
Hempfield, in his deposition, admitted that he had no data available to support that figure (See excerpts from Polito deposition, 
attached as tab 3b to Kresge's first motion for summary judgment).  While Polito in a Supplemental Affidavit, purports to 
document that figure, defendant claims that an investigation of Hempfield's creditors with out of state addresses discloses that 
an overwhelming majority shipped merchandise to plaintiff from distribution centers which they maintained in Pennsylvania.  
(See Richmond Affidavit, tab 6, to defendant's earlier motion for summary judgment)."
1293,16," The allegations in the complaint are to be taken as true on motion for summary judgment except as they may be contradicted 
by stipulated fact, affidavit or other material properly submitted to the court.  Cf. Hiern v. St. Paul-Mercury Indemnity Co., 262 
F.2d 526, 529 (5th Cir. 1959). "
1294,17," See opinion of March 14, 1972."
1294,18," The following are instances where goods brought from without the state are considered to remain within the flow of interstate 
commerce: (1) where the shipment is made in anticipation of needs of specific customers rather than on prior orders or contracts 
and there is, therefore, a practical continuity in transit necessary to keep a movement of goods ""in commerce."" See United 
States v. Richter Concrete Corporation, supra; (2) where the goods are purchased by the retailer from the supplier to meet the 
needs of specified customers pursuant to some understanding with the customer, although not for immediate delivery; and (3) 
where the goods are purchased by the retailer based upon the anticipated needs of specified customers. See Walker Oil Co. v. 
Hudson Oil Co. of Missouri, 414 F.2d 588 (5th Cir. 1969); Walling v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 317 U.S. 564, 87 L. Ed. 460, 63 
S. Ct. 332 (1945). See also Country Maid v. Haseotes, 324 F. Supp. 875 (E.D. Pa. 1971). "
1295,19," In support of its argument that Hempfield's share of the local retail market was miniscule, defendant submitted an Affidavit of 
James F. Stangl, a Research Analyst and Client Service Representative employed by Management Science Associates, Inc. 
(Tab 5 to Kresge Motion for Summary Judgment).  Stangl conducted an on-site survey of retail outlets within a 5-mile radius of 
the two stores to make a competitive profile of the markets in which the two K-Mart Food Stores operated by Hempfield were 
involved.  The results of the survey indicate that Food Store 4032 had 17 competitors in the supermarket business, that there 
were 26 ""Mom and Pop"" convenience grocery stores, 2 delicatessens, 3 drug stores and 4 mass merchandise stores within a 
five mile radius. (See Exhibit A to Stangl Affidavit). For Food Store 4064, there were 29 supermarket competitors, 7 ""Mom and 
Pop"" convenience grocery stores, 8 delicatessens, 5 drug stores and 14 mass merchandise stores (Exhibit B to Stangl Affidavit). 
The Stangl Affidavit also contains various published data on retail food stores.  The Stangl findings were interpreted by Alfred A. 
Kuehn, President of Management Science Associates (see Tab 4 to Defendant's Motion).  Defendant, however, has objected to 
the Kuehn affidavit claiming it is inadmissible hearsay and must be ignored.  Finding that the Kuehn affidavit is in the nature of 
expert testimony, we have not relied upon it.  However, we take judicial notice of the highly competitive market in which the 
Hempfield Stores were located, of which they had in the vicinity of 1% of the market. "
1296,20," Substantial restraints may be viewed either quantitatively or qualitatively.  The quantitative approach looks to the proportion of 
the total volume of the flow of commerce in a line of goods or services which is affected by the restraints.  Qualitative 
insubstantiality is the standard used to determine whether the restraint is essentially local in nature without such effect as would 
justify the assumption of federal jurisdiction.  See generally, 1 Von Kalinowski, P 5.01(4), at 5-105. "
1298,21," ""Inelastic"" simply means that the demand for groceries is constant.  Therefore, defendant argues that Hempfield's going out of 
business could not have affected interstate commerce. See Appendix C to defendant's brief. "
1299,22," We have carefully examined each of the other restraints alleged and conclude that none occurred in or substantially affected 
interstate commerce. "
1303,23," See Oral Argument on Motions for Summary Judgment, September 25, 1974, Tr. 47. "
1305,24," We express no opinion as to whether Hempfield's participation in the conduct complained of precludes recovery by its trustee 
in bankruptcy as a matter of law. "
