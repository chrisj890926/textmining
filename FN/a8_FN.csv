respecting which [the Government judgment] would be an estoppel as between the parties thereto."" 15 U.S.C. § 16(a) (1964). The major part of the defendant's argument in Minnesota Mining was based on the assumption that the two provisions in section 
5 are co-extensive - that is, if one encompasses FTC proceedings them the other must also.  From this assumption, the 
defendant argued that findings in FTC proceedings could not be used as prima facie evidence in private treble damage actions 
and thus could not have tolling effect.  The Supreme Court found, however, that the two provisions are not co-extensive and 
stated that if FTC findings could not be used as prima facie evidence, this does not mean that an FTC proceeding could not 
have tolling effect."

80,5," The heart of the FTC complaint states: Paragraph Four: It is now, and has been for some time, the practice and policy of respondent to adopt and employ in the 
various states of the United States and the District of Columbia, a system of establishing resale prices for its products by 
various means and methods, including the requirement that its dealers maintain or adhere to the prices established and 
promulgated by respondent. Paragraph Five: By various means and methods, respondent has entered into and effectuate the aforesaid practice and 
policy by which it can and does control, establish, manipulate, fix, and maintain the resale prices at which its products are 
sold by its dealers. In order to carry out the said plan or policy, respondent adopted and employed and still employs the 
following means among others, by which it has undertaken to prevent and has prevented dealers from selling said products 
at prices other than the said resale prices established by respondent: (a) It issues resale price lists and advertising material to the trade in which the various resale prices for said products are 
set forth and explained; (b) It makes it generally known to the trade, by direct or indirect means, that it expects and requires all dealers handling 
Lenox fine china products to maintain and enforce said resale prices or such dealerships will be terminated; (c) It enters into formal and informal agreements, understandings, and arrangments with its dealers as a condition 
precedent to the opening of new accounts that such dealers will maintain resale prices; (d) It solicits, invites and obtains from dealers handling Lenox fine china products cooperation and assistance in 
ascertaining information pertaining to any dealers or others who resell such products and fail to maintain resale prices 
established by respondent; (e) It employs a system of policing the maintenance of resale prices by dealers which includes, among other things, 
""rigged"" orders and examinations of these orders by an electrical process; (f) It subscribes to and actively employs a ""clipping"" service to ascertain which dealers are advertising said products at 
resale prices below those established by respondent; (g) It directs Lenox salesmen and other employees to secure information identifying any dealer who fails to observe the 
established resale prices; (h) It threatens to terminate and does terminate the franchises of Lenox dealers who fail to observe and maintain the 
established retail prices; (i) It threatens to terminate and does terminate the franchises of Lenox dealers who advertise Lenox fine china products at 
other than the established resale prices without Lenox's the extablished resale prices without Lenox's permission; (j) It has in effect a program by which it makes known to dealers handling Lenox products that failure to maintain the 
established resale prices will result in termination of their franchise. "
81,," The above are among the various means and methods which have been used and are now being used by respondent in 
the enforcement of its system of maintaining established prices; all with the result that said prices have been and are 
generally observed and maintained by dealers handling Lenox products. There can be no doubt that this complaint is aimed at a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act - resale price 
maintainance.  See United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., 362 U.S. 29, 4 L. Ed. 2d 505, 80 S. Ct. 503 (1960)."
81,6," The FTC complaint is quoted in pertinent part in footnote 5, supra.  It alleges a scheme of resale price maintenance enforced 
through various means and depending upon dealer agreement to Lenox's set prices.  Therefore, the allegations fit within what 
the Supreme Court of the United States declared to be a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act in United States v. 
Parke, Davis & Co., 362 U.S. 29, 4 L. Ed. 2d 505, 80 S. Ct. 503 (1960). It might have been possible for the FTC to have alleged "
82,," facts which would have fallen short of those present in Parke Davis but still fit within the prohibitions of Section 5 of the FTCA.  In 
such a case, they would have been relying upon the preventive nature of Section 5 of the FTCA. "
90,1," Over-the-air subscription television differs from conventional broadcasting in the nature of the signal that is transmitted; a 
subscription station broadcasts a ""scrambled"" signal that can be converted to intelligible form by special equipment which also 
assesses charges for the subscription programs viewed.  CATV systems with direct cable links to subscribers' television sets are 
also technically capable of using similar devices to offer subscription services. The Federal Communications Commission 
investigated the possibility of authorizing subscription services on CATV networks, and concluded that the most efficient means 
of establishing pay television at present was through broadcasting stations. See Fourth Report and Order on Subscription

110,3," The following provision was imposed by the Board as a condition of approval of the agreement (J.A. 499): Except in connection with aircraft which it may sell, own or operate, or on a casual, infrequent or emergency basis, Pan 
American will not engage in the aviation service business at Teterboro airport; provided however, that Pan American may 
provide such services for a period up to 90 days if necessitated by failure of persons normally engaged in such activities to 
provide such services. "
111,4," It is true that a determination of the public interest by the Port Authority is not conclusive of the public interest inquiry that the 
Board is required to make under section 408(b) of the Federal Aviation Act; obviously, the Port Authority is not charged with the "
112,," duty of implementing the federal antitrust laws, and the Board must make an independent investigation of antitrust 
considerations once its jurisdiction attaches under section 408.  That is not to say, however, that the Board should completely 
disregard the Port Authority's findings.  The fact that the public agency controlling Teterboro has determined that the agreement 
with Pan American will best serve the public, and the reasons it gave for this determination, are helpful indicators of the strength 
of the public interest in approval of the agreement, and the Board must balance this interest against the possible anticompetitive 
effects of the agreement."

301 F. Supp. 273 (S.D.N.Y. 1969). "
170,3," Since the total amount of MH-30 that can be sold for use by tobacco growers is limited by the size of the tobacco crop, the 
market is a relatively inelastic one, so that price reductions would not normally achieve a substantial permanent increase in the 
price-cutter's market share.  In a free competitive market any such price reduction would be met immediately and each 
distributor and jobber would fail to gain any substantial increase in his share of the market as a result of cutting price. "
171,4," In early 1960 Woolfolk Chemical Company, Ft. Valley, Ga., an MH-30 distributor, was notified by Ramsey that since it had 
engaged in cutting prices, it was being cut off.  Thereafter Woolfolk was restricted to purchases of up to 500 gallons of MH-30 
until Uniroyal would regain confidence in it (PX 734). At the end of the 1961 tobacco growing season Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation, a Uniroyal distributor entitled to sell MH-
30 in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, was discontinued by Uniroyal because it had sold MH-30 to dealers below 
Uniroyal's suggested resale price and had made sales outside of its assigned territory. When Olin thereafter attempted to 
purchase MH-30 from Maxwell, another MH-30 distributor, Uniroyal salesmen persuaded Maxwell not to sell to Olin. In December 1962 Graham Chemical Company, an MH-30 distributor authorized to sell MH-30 in parts of North Carolina and 
Virginia, but not in other areas of Virginia where it sold other agricultural chemicals, was cut off by Uniroyal as an MH-30 
distributor for the reason that it had made sales of MH-30 below Uniroyal's suggested resale prices, including sales to dealers 
who were not on the approved list, such as Smith Seed of Danville, Virginia.  Uniroyal also accused it of selling MH-30 to sub-
distributors, i.e., companies not directly authorized by Uniroyal to distribute MH-30.  We reject defendant's contention that 
Graham was cut off primarily because of credit problems.  The record reveals an entry made by Uniroyal's credit department on

to have deleted in November 1962, just before Graham was discontinued. Furthermore, after it was discontinued in December 
1962 Graham wrote a letter to Uniroyal in January 1963 offering to pay in advance for shipments.  This sequence of events 
renders Ramsey's testimony suspect, at least on this issue. In the middle of the 1963 tobacco growing season Louisville Chemical Company, which had been a distributor of MH-30 since 
1958, was discontinued by Uniroyal as a distributor because it had made sales of MH-30 to dealers who sold below Uniroyal's

249,22," No significance for present purposes can be ascribed to S.Rep. No. 390, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 4 (1965), cited in the majority 
opinion. The context is entirely unrelated.  The Committee Report explained the need to amend § 271 of the Act to make clear that it did 
not confer on State or local agencies any authority to regulate or restrict activities of the Atomic Energy Commission.  The 
amendment was prompted by a Court of Appeals opinion that under the pre-1965 version of § 271 -- providing that the Act did 
not affect the authority of a local agency as to transmission of electric power produced with licensed nuclear facilities -- the 
zoning ordinances of Woodside, California, prohibited the construction of an overhead line projected by the AEC in order to 
receive power for the servicing of a $114 million linear accelerator facility being built on Stanford University property pursuant to 
Congressional authorization. In a background section for this entirely unrelated provision the Committee Report contained a passage latched on to in the 
majority opinion as follows (p. 4): Because of these unique provisions in the act pertaining to AEC's licensing and regulation of persons operating reactors 
which could be used to produce electricity, there was some feeling of uneasiness among the drafters of the legislation over 
the effect of the new law upon other agencies -- Federal, State, and local -- having jurisdiction over the generation, sale, 
and transmission of electric power.  It was recognized by the drafters that the authority of these other agencies with respect 
to the generation, sale, and transmission of electric power produced through the use of nuclear facilities was not affected by 
this new law; and that AEC's regulatory control was limited to considerations involving the common defense and security 
and the protection of the health and safety of the public with respect to the special hazards associated with the operation of 
nuclear facilities.  Nevertheless, section 271 was added to make it explicit that licensees of the AEC who produced power 
through the use of nuclear facilities would otherwise remain subject to the authority of all appropriate Federal, State, and 
local authorities with respect to the generation, sale, or transmission of electric power. In context this indicates only that the AEC did not have direct regulatory control over the transmission of electric power.  The 
words plainly do not embody a legislative determination that the AEC was forbidden to consider antitrust matters as a condition 
of licensing. If those words were meant to have that meaning they would also apply to § 103 licensing. The AEC acquiesces that under § 103 it should consider antitrust matters.  Can it be supposed for one moment that this 
backdrop discussion, in passing, was meant to set aside this understanding?  The discussion is irrelevant for present purposes. "
250,1," I dissent, too, from the holding that the Commission properly denied intervention to the Massachusetts municipals on the 
ground that the motion to dismiss Vermont Yankee's application as improperly filed was not made in the initial petition.  The 
antitrust allegations in the petition provided adequate notice to the Commission that the jurisdictional distinction between 
research and development and commercial licenses was basic to the municipals' claim.  The Commission did not sustain the 
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board's denial of intervention solely on this point of pleading, but cited the rationale of the Duke 
Power decision holding that jurisdiction under § 104(b) was proper.  To allow intervention to raise the jurisdictional issue would 
not have greatly expanded the proceedings, especially in light of its likely disposition.  Cf. Northwest Airlines v. Civil Aeronautics 
Board, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 158, 164-165, 194 F.2d 339, 344-345 (1952)."

grounds in Municipal Electric Ass'n of Mass. v. Securities and Exchange Comm., 134 U.S.App.D.C. 145, 413 F.2d 1052 "

a provisional construction permit for a reactor, based on ""reasonable assurance"" that there would be sufficient firm evidence that 
the reactor would meet operating safety standards by the time it was ready for service.  All nuclear facilities are, of course, 
cleared for safety before they receive operating licenses. It seems at least bizarre that reasonable assurance is enough to 
predict safe operation, but not enough for a forecast of commercial profitability."
251,4," ""Thus, the consequences of a statutory finding of practical value with respect to present types of single purpose light water,

of this category that are now being sold, and it is well understood that AEC does not presently intend to recommend such aid 
and that the cognizant committee of Congress would not be likely to report favorably on its authorization."" 31 Fed.Reg. at 223."

260,7," The court set forth six reasons why the Federal Trade Commission order before it could not be admitted pursuant to section 
5(a).  First, the Commission's order lacked finality: ""The result of the proceedings before the Commission is an order which has 
no effect in itself, unless made operative by the Circuit Court of Appeals, which has power of review."" John Bene, supra at 730. 
Secondly, a Commission proceeding was not a ""proceeding in equity"" as the statute then required.  Thirdly, a Commission 
proceeding was not brought by or on behalf of the United States.  Fourthly, the Commission order in that case was apparently 
that the defendant had violated the Federal Trade Commission Act, which has never been considered an ""antitrust law"" as that 
term is used in section 5(a).  Thus, the order was not ""under the antitrust laws"".  Fifthly, for the same reason, there was thus no 
finding ""to the effect"" that the defendant had violated an ""antitrust law"".  Finally, the order itself was only against John Bene & 
Sons, Inc., but the plaintiff wanted to offer it against several additional defendants in the subsequent suit. It should be noted at this point that while these six prerequisites to admissibility still exist with minor changes of wording, only the 
first three are relevant to our case.  Here, the Commission order was ""to the effect"" that Forster had violated section 2(a) of the 
Clayton Act (rather than the Federal Trade Commission Act as in John Bene) which is clearly an ""antitrust law"".  15 U.S.C. §§

261,11," In argument before the Supreme Court, the positions of the parties and amici varied.  The petitioner (defendant in the district 
court), while conceding in its brief that section 5(a) was not ""directly involved"", nevertheless endeavored to tie the two sections 
together as the product of one dominant Congressional intent -- to deal with proceedings in court.  The respondent on certiorari 
(plaintiff in the district court) never conceded that the two clauses were interdependent or in pari materia.  Almost one fourth of 
its brief on the issue of tolling was devoted to arguing that the two were not coextensive.  It then proceeded, arguendo, to 
contend that section 5(a) applied to Commission orders.  The United States, as amicus, devoted a major part of its brief in 
support of the Third Circuit decision to asserting the irrelevancy of section 5(a) in deciding the applicability of section 5(b).  It also 
conceded for the purposes of the case that section 5(a) did not apply to Commission orders.  Private amici, contending with 
each other in the Eighth Circuit, predictably took opposite tacks; one devoted 64 pages to trying to demonstrate equivalence 
between sections 5(a) and (b), while the other asserted a lack of interdependence."

263,24," See nn. 7-8, infra."
263,25," 15 U.S.C. § 21(g)(3) -- the present codification of the Finality Act -- so provides.  In a footnote, however, Forster contends that 
in light of FTC v. Jantzen, 386 U.S. 228, 18 L. Ed. 2d 11, 87 S. Ct. 998 (1967), the Finality Act of 1959 would not apply to the 
Commission order of July 23, 1965 which was admitted below, simply because the Commission proceeding was instituted prior 
to the enactment of the Finality Act. We cannot agree. Jantzen involved a Commission order entered prior to the enactment of the Finality Act, not afterwards as in our case.  The 
entire thrust of the Court's opinion is directed at pre-1959 orders.  The Court seemed to rely essentially on two reasons for its "
264,," holding that the Act did not apply to pre-1959 orders.  First, because of the heavy penalties which can be visited on the violator 
of a final Commission order, Congress felt it unfair to use the Finality Act retroactively so as to finalize pre-existing Commission 
orders.  386 U.S. at 233-34. Yet no such unfairness results by applying the Finality Act prospectively to finalize orders entered 
after July 1959.  See Sperry Rand Corp. v. FTC, 110 U.S. App. D.C. 1, 288 F.2d 403 (1961), cited with approval in Jantzen, for 
an excellent discussion of this point. Secondly -- and apparently more importantly -- the Court recognized that a failure to apply the old enforcement procedures to 
pre-1959 orders would mean that such orders could not be enforced at all.  386 U.S. at 234. As a result, some 400 violators 
would have been absolved from Commission orders and the Commission would have to begin anew against all 400.  Yet no 
such unsatisfactory result occurs by applying the Finality Act to orders entered after its passage.  On the contrary, to apply the 
old procedures to all Commission proceedings begun before July 1959, would significantly postpone the operation of the Act.  
For example, in our case, the Commission would be required to use the ""laborious, time consuming, and very expensive"" 3-step 
enforcement procedure rejected by Congress in 1959, S. Rep. No. 83, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1959), to enforce an order 
entered a full six years after the new procedures were enacted.  Such a result is wholly inconsistent with the legislative purpose 
of expediting the enforcement of Commission orders.  The only sensible construction of the Act would be to apply it as soon as 
the fairness consideration mentioned above would allow.  S. Rep. No. 83, supra.  Accordingly, we conclude that both the holding 
in Jantzen and its rationale were necessarily confined to pre-1959 orders, and that the legislative purpose demands that the 
Finality Act be applied to post-1959 orders such as the one admitted below.  We believe that the Sperry Rand decision 
mentioned above fully supports our conclusion.  We find no cases suggesting the contrary."
264,26," The Congressional Record indicates at 9068 that the proponent of the original bill was allotted eight hours for general debate.  
It is our understanding from the Congressional Record that the opponents also consumed eight hours."
264,27," We note two instances where material quoted to us has a different meaning when viewed in fuller context.  First, emphasis 
has been placed by Forster in its brief on an exchange between Senators Sutherland and Crawford concerning an amendment 
to the Federal Trade Commission Act: ""Mr. Sutherland. . . . So far as the findings of the commission are concerned, I do not think they ought to be evidence 
anywhere. ""Mr. Crawford: I do not either. ""Mr. Sutherland.  I doubt very much whether we could make them evidence."" 51 Cong. Rec. 12789-90 (1914). Yet this brief exchange is less persuasive when placed in context.  The amendment, proposed by Senator Cummins of Iowa and 
accepted by Senator Newlands for the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee, provided: ""That no order or finding of the court or commission in the enforcement of this section shall be admissible as evidence in 
any suit, civil or criminal, brought under the antitrust laws."" 51 Cong. Rec. 12726 (1914). "
265,," The reason for the amendment was not that an order of the Commission was not of the dignity of that of a court but that ""The order of the court or the commission . . . would be simply that the defendant had been guilty of unfair competition. . . . 
It is the purpose of this amendment to prevent the judgment in one case becoming res adjudicata in the other case"". 51 
Cong. Rec. 12787 (1914) (remarks of Sen. Cummins). This amendment passed the Senate by a vote of 40 to 13. 51 Cong. Rec. 12804 (1914).  Although it did not find its way into the 
final bill in that form, the Senate had equated orders of the Commission with those of a court.  Moreover, the underlying 
assumption must have been that orders of the Commission, unless specifically banned, could be evidence in subsequent civil or 
criminal proceedings. Secondly, our attention has been directed to the following remark by Senator Walsh, the spokesman for the Judiciary 
Committee, which appears at 51 Cong. Rec. 13856-13857: ""I want to say just a word with reference to the authorities to which the attention of the Senate has been invited. . . . Nobody 
questions them. They all lay down the rule that in an action brought against an individual who has never theretofore had his 
day in court you can not make a certificate or a recital or an order of an administrative board or anything of that kind 
conclusive evidence against him."" However, in his very next sentence Senator Walsh states that ""You may make it prima facie evidence."" Thus, even in 1914, it 
was recognized that a Commission order could be given prima facie effect. Of course the statute as eventually enacted contained the prima facie evidentiary effect which Senator Walsh had said could 
properly be given to administrative orders.  One can only conjecture why Senator Walsh did not later point out that the bill as 
changed could include administrative orders as well as court orders."
265,28," A few isolated references to juries have been brought to our attention -- e.g., 51 Cong. Rec. 13900, 13901 (1914) -- but since 
it has long been accepted that a judgment in a non-jury trial is admissible under section 5(a) -- e.g., Hanover Shoe v. United 
Shoe Machinery, 392 U.S. 481, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231, 88 S. Ct. 2224 (1968) -- those few references cannot be said to limit the 
reach of section 5(a). "

statute of 1840 can include Tommy guns, tear gas, or atomic bombs.  'Vehicle,' in a statute of 1840, can properly be read, 
when sense so suggests, to include an automobile, or a hydroplane that lacks wheels.  But for all that, the sound quest 
does not run primarily in terms of historical intent.  It runs in terms of what the words can be made to bear, in making sense 
in the new light of what was originally unforeseen."" See also Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert Corp., 341 U.S. 384, 395-396,

seems clear that procedural due process is accorded defendants before the Federal Trade Commission. We note also that the

268,38," Our holding is in accord with those cases holding that the determination of an issue by the Federal Trade Commission is res 
judicata of that matter insofar as other branches of the United States government is concerned.  E.g., United States v. Willard 
Tablet Co., 141 F.2d 141, 142-143 (7th Cir. 1944); 152 A.L.R. 1194; United States v. Piuma, 40 F. Supp. 119, 122 (S.D. Cal. 
1941), aff'd, Piuma v. United States, 126 F.2d 601 (9th Cir. 1942), cert. denied, 317 U.S. 637, 87 L. Ed. 513, 63 S. Ct. 28 
(1942); United States v. Five Cases of Capon Springs Water, 62 F. Supp. 736, 738-739 (S.D.N.Y. 1945), rev'd on other grounds, 
156 F.2d 493, 495 (2d Cir. 1946); United States v. Hindman, 179 F. Supp. 926, 927 (D.N.J. 1960). Necessarily implicit in these decisions is the proposition that a final Commission order is qualitatively comparable to a court 
judgment. "
269,39," Forster, ill-advisedly in our view, urges that this issue was not open to Farmington, since Farmington's notice of appeal was 
more than 30 days from the date of final judgment. Final judgment was entered on March 11, 1969; Forster noticed its appeal on March 17.  On March 18, Farmington filed a timely 
motion under Rule 59(e), Fed. R. Civ. P., to amend the judgment insofar as it refused to award reasonable attorney fees, which 
motion was denied on March 26.  On April 25 -- 45 days after final judgment, but only 30 days after denial of the Rule 59(e) 
motion -- Farmington noticed its appeal. HN8[
] Rule 4(a), Fed. R. App. P., expressly provides that the 30-day time for appeal shall commence anew following the entry of an order concerning any timely motion under, inter alia, Rule 59(e).  Indeed, there was no artful way for Farmington to 
file a general appeal before March 26, for any such general appeal might have placed the district court in the awkward position 
of having lost jurisdiction while still being asked by the same party to make a specific alteration of the judgment.  March 26 was 
the logical time to start the 30-day period and Rule 4(a) so provides.  We do not understand Rule 4(a) to attach any significance 
to the fact that the appeal of April 25 raised more objections to the judgment than had the Rule 59(e) motion."
269,40," Specifically, Farmington requested admission pursuant to section 5(a) of the following documents:"
269,1," .  Examiner's Initial Decision, dated February 2, 1962, as it relates to skewers;"
269,2," .  Opinion of the Commission, dated January 3, 1963, as it relates to skewers;"
269,3," .  Final Order, dated March 18, 1963, as it relates to skewers;"
269,4," .  Opinion on Remand, dated July 23, 1965, as it relates to skewers, and"
269,5," .  Final Order, dated July 23, 1965, as it relates to skewers. In addition Farmington compiled the findings made therein and presented its compilation as Plaintiff's Exhibit IB(iv), which 
included the following categories: formal identification of defendant (items 1 and 2); the shares of the six skewer manufacturers 
in the U.S. market (item 3); the early history of Farmington (items 4-6); the development of animosity between Farmington and 
Forster, cancellation of orders from Farmington by Forster, Farmington's efforts to seek other customers, various threats and 
general price cuts by Forster (items 7-17); discriminatory price cuts given to four customers by Forster (items 18-25); causal 
relation between the discriminatory price cuts and Farmington's failure and lessening of competition in the skewer industry 
generally, tending to create a monopoly in the skewer industry, absence of justifiable reason (items 26-33); conclusions that 
Forster was ""not merely meeting competition, but . . . beating it"", that ""this is not a close case"" concerning good faith meeting of 
competition, that Forster was motivated by predatory intent (items 34-38). "
270,41," Additional authorities suggest that the ""necessarily decided"" limitation is rather firmly embedded in the law of collateral 
estoppel. In Yates v. United States, 354 U.S. 298, 336, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1356, 77 S. Ct. 1064 (1957), the Supreme Court asserted: "" . . HN10[
] . the doctrine of collateral estoppel . . . makes conclusive in subsequent proceedings only determinations of 
fact, and mixed fact and law, that were essential to the decision. . . .  Commissioner v. Sunnen, 333 U.S. 591, 601-602, 92 
L. Ed. 898, 68 S. Ct. 715; Tait v. Western Maryland R. Co., 289 U.S. 620, 77 L. Ed. 1405, 53 S. Ct. 706; The Evergreens v. 
Nunan, 141 F.2d 927, 928.""  Years earlier, Judge Learned Hand had occasion to confront this problem: ""HN11[
] A judgment . . . may be an estoppel . . . the estoppel extends only to facts decided and necessary to the 
decision.  All this is very old law."" Irving National Bank v. Law, 10 F.2d 721, 724 (2d Cir. 1926). See also Restatement, Judgments § 68(1) and comment o; 1B Moore's Federal Practice, 2d Ed., para. 0.441[2], p. 3777."
270,42," At 338, the Court stated: ""HN12[
] The normal rule is that a prior judgment need be given no conclusive effect at all unless it establishes one of the 
ultimate facts in issue in the subsequent proceeding.  So far as merely evidentiary or 'mediate' facts are concerned, the 
doctrine of collateral estoppel is inoperative.  The Evergreens v. Nunan, 141 F.2d 927; Restatement, Judgments § 68, 
comment p.""  But see Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v. Goldwyn, 328 F.2d 190, 225-226 (9th Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 880, 13 L. 
Ed. 2d 87, 85 S. Ct. 143 (1964). This case is cited appropriately by Farmington for the proposition that all matters decided in a 
prior proceeding which are ""relevant"" to a subsequent one are admissible under section 5(a).  We find the case enigmatic, for its 
referenced authority in Emich, but its formulation of principle overlooked the ""necessarily decided"" limitation expressed in Emich.  
It may well be that the findings held to be admissible qualified under Emich.  But we cannot take the brief and possibly 
unconsidered reference to a standard of mere relevancy in Twentieth Century Fox as definitive.  See our opinion in International 
Shoe Machinery Corp. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 315 F.2d 449, 453-454, 459 (1st Cir. 1963), for a discussion of our view 
of how ""relevancy"" bears on the operation of section 5(a). "
272,43," HN14[
] Section 2(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13 (a), provides in relevant part: ""It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, . . . to discriminate in price between different purchasers of 
commodities . . . where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a 
monopoly in any line of commerce . . . ."""
272,44," Of course nothing we say herein concerning collateral estoppel is intended to detract from the general rule, which has our 
unqualified support, that the Commission should set forth its findings of fact, reasoning and conclusions of law as fully and 
carefully as possible."
272,45," We understand Forster to misunderstand Farmington's argument on this point.  Forster argues that Farmington cannot get lost 
profits from 1956 to November 1968 in addition to its ""going concern"" value as of February 1958.  We of course agree.  See 
discussion in text, infra.  Yet we understand Farmington, at least initially, to be seeking its ""going concern"" value as of November "
273,1968," (Trial Record, Vol. 5, pp. 169, 190; Brief, p. 43), rather than as of February 1958 as Forster's argument suggests. (Reply 
Brief, pp. 18-19)"
273,46," Farmington seems to draw the greatest comfort from Twentieth Century-Fox Corp. v. Brookside Theatre Corp., 194 F.2d 846 
(8th Cir. 1952), cert. denied, 343 U.S. 942, 96 L. Ed. 1348, 72 S. Ct. 1035 (1952). That case did take account of lost profits for a 
period after the time that the plaintiff had been driven out of business.  However, critical distinctions exist.  First, unlike our case, 
the business in that case was continued in essentially the same form by one of the defendants, thereby producing actual profits 
over the period in question which could be estimated with some degree of certainty.  Secondly, that court did not make an award 
for future lost profits in addition to an award for ""going concern"" value, which is what Farmington seeks here.  Finally, to the 
extent that the court may have awarded what could be called the ""going concern"" value of the plaintiff there, it was figured as of 
the day that the plaintiff had been forced out of business. Farmington relies also on Atlas Building Products Co. v. Diamond Block & Gravel Co., 269 F.2d 950 (10th Cir. 1959), cert. 
denied, 363 U.S. 843, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1727, 80 S. Ct. 1608 (1960), which decision upheld an award of lost profits and diminished 
asset value.  Yet the method used by the district court in our case awards both aspects of damages.  The basic dispute between 
the district court and Farmington seems to us to concern the date for which ""going concern"" value should be determined.  The 
Atlas Building case gives no indication of the date for which ""diminished asset"" value was determined in that case.  Since that 
business continued up to the time of trial, there is little speculation involved in estimating ""diminished asset"" value as of the time 
of trial, assuming arguendo that the court did so.  Yet in our case, when the business ends on a given date, it seems far too 
speculative to give ""going concern"" value for a date ten years after it had ceased to be a going concern."
273,47," E. Timberlake, ""The Legal Injury Requirements and Proof of Damages in Treble Damage Actions Under the Antitrust Laws"", 
30 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 231, 280 (1961). We note that the district court stated its reason in terms of ""duplication"".  On analysis, 
we see no duplication in estimating ten years' profits, followed by an estimate of the going concern value at the end of those ten 
years -- which involves putative profits for subsequent years.  But, for reasons stated, we agree with the district court's ruling. "
274,48," The district court noted at least four reasons why the two businesses were not sufficiently comparable. First, while 
Farmington's production was limited almost entirely to wooden skewers, Forster manufactured some 24 woodenware products in 
addition to skewers, which comprised a relatively small proportion of its total business.  Second, Farmington had no sales or 
distribution organization which was remotely comparable to the extensive sales and distribution organization which Forster 
maintained throughout the United States.  Third, Farmington was minimally capitalized, while Forster was adequately 
capitalized.  Finally, Forster would be an inappropriate yardstick of comparison after 1956 simply because Forster's sales and 
profits after that time reflected the illegal monopolization and discriminatory sales which Farmington had to show in order to be 
entitled to any damages.  Clearly Farmington was no more entitled to the monopoly profit than Forster was. The only countervailing evidence offered by Farmington was Professor Chances' own testimony that Farmington and Forster 
were selling a similarly-made product to the same general group of customers. "
275,49," We recognize that a witness somewhat similar to Richard Norton was allowed to testify in both Story Parchment, supra at 567, 
and in William H. Rankin v. Associated Bill Posters of United States and Canada, 42 F.2d 152, 155 (2d Cir. 1930). However, we 
find nothing in either case to suggest that such a witness must be allowed to testify."
275,50," Arriving at value through capitalization of projected earnings involves evaluating ""the present worth of each part of the stream 
of future receipts"" and adding ""these separate present discounted values."" Samuelson, Economics: An Introductory Analysis, 6th 
ed., p. 587.  Capitalized market value is not arrived at simply by multiplying average earnings and an appropriate number of 
years, the method apparently used by Norton. "
276,51," This figure is claimed by Forster to be impeached by the testimony of its expert that the $13,103 figure was inflated by at least 
$10,000, apparently by reason of an understated beginning inventory.  Yet this writedown was not conclusively established, and 
the jury apparently accepted the $14,500 figure for the purpose of arriving at its award of $29,100 for lost profits between May 
1956 and February 1958, which award was not appealed.  Even if there had been such an alleged writedown, the effect would 
would have been to make 1955 more profitable and the first 8 months of 1956 less so -- not, on balance, a critically different 
posture for Farmington.  While Forster could have better argued a downward dip, Farmington could have pointed to a more 
impressive showing prior to the intense period of pressure from Forster."
276,52," It seems to have been assumed by all parties that Forster was the most similar to Farmington although not comparable 
enough to be used as a yardstick.  See n. 48, supra."
276,53," The value of orders cancelled ($28,950) amounted to 20% of the projected yearly purchases by Forster, and 12% (or one and 
a half months) of Farmington's total sales.  While the case contents and unit price to arrive at these figures were in evidence, we 
do not suppose that the jury made this precise a calculation.  But it would have been justified in concluding that the cancellation 
posed a substantial problem. "
277,54," HN17[
] Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15 (1964), provides: ""Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue 
therefor . . . and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable 
attorney's fee."""
277,55," It should be noted that Farmington had three different law firms working on this case at various times.  The fee arrangement in 
question provides that the chief counsel will get two thirds of the fee and that the two local counsel will share one third."
277,56," A second aspect of Farmington's appeal of the court's ruling under section 4 of the Clayton Act concerned the court's refusal 
to award Farmington some $6,920.77 as its ""cost of suit"".  Having carefully read the district court's treatment of this issue at 930 
of the above-noted opinion and the cases cited therein, we are satisfied that Farmington's claim was properly denied."
277,57," At the outset, Forster contends that Farmington is without ""standing"" on this issue and is not ""the real party in interest"" since, 
under Farmington's fee arrangement, any recovery would go to Farmington's attorneys.  This argument is without merit.  As we 
note below, the statutory provision authorizing the recovery of counsel fees was intended to benefit antitrust plaintiffs by enabling 
them to retain the bulk of their trebled damages.  It is clearly the plaintiff's statutory right; it was not intended to confer a statutory "
278,," right on plaintiff's counsel and no one to our knowledge has ever seriously suggested that attorneys have standing under 
section 4.  Since the provision conferred a right on plaintiffs, they must have standing to assert it.  The fact that Farmington may 
be contractually obligated with regard to the recovery does not affect its statutory right or its standing to assert it. Invoking the ""real party in interest"" rule adds nothing to Forster's argument, since the real party in interest need not be the party 
beneficially interested in a particular case, but only the party who under the substantive law has the right sought to be enforced. 
3A Moore's Federal Practice, para. 17.07."
278,58," The court, not desiring to interfere with that part of the fee agreement calling for one third of the treble damages, was willing to 
tolerate a margin of difference between its section 4 decision and the amount actually to be paid counsel.  It noted that one third 
of treble damages was ""already nearly 30% more than it has concluded is reasonable."" 297 F. Supp. at 929. It then looked at the 
total amount which the fee agreement would produce, and noted that this would be twice what it found reasonable, 175% of 
single damages, 58% of trebled damages, and would result in hourly rates of compensation for senior and junior partners and 
associates beyond those realized from the section 4 fee allowances in the cases listed in Appendices of its opinion.  As a final 
reason, the court noted that counsel for plaintiff had sought only $109,100 as the amount of the ""attorney's fee"" award under 
section 4."
278,59," HN18[
] Canons of Professional Ethics, Canon 13: ""A contract for a contingent fee, where sanctioned by law, should be reasonable under all the circumstances of the case, 
including the risk and uncertainty of the compensation, but should always be subject to the supervision of a court, as to its 
reasonableness."" See also Canon 12. E.g., Fitzgerald v. Freeman, 409 F.2d 427 (7th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 875, 90 S. Ct. 151, 24 L. Ed. 2d 134, 38

2d 4, 6 (1966); see F. MacKinnon, Contingent Fees for Legal Services, p. 66 (1964)."
278,60," We can think of at least three reasons why a court might be more inclined to inquire into successful plaintiff's actual counsel 
fees in an antitrust case.  Clients may feel some distrust or disrespect for the legal profession when they are called on to honor 
fee arrangements which yield fees out of proportion to what the court declared to be a reasonable fee for purposes of section 4. "
279,," Moreover, since the court is already immersed in the counsel fee inquiry under section 4, it is not a great step further to 
measure the actual counsel fee against the Canons of Ethics.  Finally, to the extent that section 4 was intended to prevent a 
substantial diminution of the plaintiff's treble damage recovery, that purpose is frustrated when the attorney is allowed, without 
justification, to siphon off a substantial part of that award in addition to other compensation. On the other hand, in addition to all of the considerations which invariably tend to restrain a sua sponte intervention by the court, 
it seems unfortunate to single out the antitrust bar for such scrutiny.  We have no reason to believe that any abuses exist in this 
area which would justify its being treated differently from any other field of litigation.  Moreover, we are aware that an actual 
counsel fee inquiry in every antitrust case might tend to impair the ability of private litigants to acquire effective counsel to assist 
them in their efforts as private attorneys general.  A balancing of these considerations can be struck only by the district courts 
acting in their sound discretion."
279,61," While this may have been the neat division contemplated by section 4, we do not suggest that section 4 corseted either 
courts or attorneys and clients too tightly.  Section 4 obliged a court to fix an amount which was reasonable in light of the terrain 
it had crossed with counsel, which amount was to be added to the damages the defendant should pay both as a penalty and as 
a method of enabling the plaintiff to emerge with something approaching three times his proven loss.  On the other hand, clients 
and lawyers were left to make their own arrangements.  We recognize that in some difficult cases a fee arrangement entirely 
consistent with the Canons of Ethics could result in a substantial diminution of the plaintiff's treble damage recovery without 
offending section 4.  Accordingly, the actual fee arrangement between lawyer and client should have no bearing on what the 
court awards under section 4.  Milwaukee Towne Corp. v. Loew's, Inc., 190 F.2d 561, 570 (7th Cir. 1951), cert. denied, 342 U.S.

petition to the United States Oil Import Appeals Board on March 26, 1962.  In July, 1962, Interamerican's present counsel was 
retained by Mr. Maxudian, and defendants were notified in November of that year that plaintiff had ""incontrovertible proof"" that it 
was untrue that Venezuela compelled the boycott. Plaintiff does not allege receipt of any other facts between March, 1962, and

conspiracy began in the United States did not make acts, legal in Costa Rica, illegal here.  213 U.S. at 357-359. He stated that 
even if defendants induced the Costa Rican government to injure plaintiff, there could be no inquiry into the motives of that 
sovereign state.  213 U.S. at 358. Sisal Sales, however, must restrict Banana to those cases where the conspiracy has no effect 
within the United States.  Since the effect of the acts in the instant case was directly felt in the United States, federal jurisdiction 
is present, and, although the rationale of Banana is relevant to the principles here involved, that decision provides neither 
sufficient nor essential support for the result here."

compliance with a state regulatory program does not subject individuals to antitrust liability. The Sherman Act refers only to 
persons, not to states or nations, and both the Act and the Constitution would be badly misinterpreted to permit liability for acts 
of a sovereign. See also Brewster, Antitrust and American Business Abroad (1958), 94, and Fugate, Antitrust Jurisdiction and Foreign 
Sovereignty, 49 Va. L. Rev. 925 (1962), at 932, where it is said: ""The real question is whose acts are the subject of inquiry. If the acts are those of a foreign government within its own 
jurisdiction, then the antitrust exception applies.  The situation is the same if the foreign government through its laws, "
291,," regulations, or orders, requires private parties to perform the anticompetitive acts.  If, on the other hand, the acts 
complained of are in reality those of private parties who seek to hide behind the cloak of foreign law, the courts will attach 
antitrust liability."" Also Fugate, Foreign Commerce and the Antitrust Laws (1958) §§ 2.16, 2.17."
291,19," In 1955, the Attorney General's Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws reported that: "" . . . HN3[

that country."" Report of the Attorney General's Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws (1955), p. 83, quoted in Fugate,

to Mr. Maxudian, Leiva could not decide whether the advance was a loan or payment for stock. Leiva says he never was issued

295,31," The testimony of Interamerican's officers goes so far to exonerate Amoco that one wonders why such a good friend was made

crude oil from foreign sources to enable plaintiff to meet its charter and processing contract objectives."" Mr. Maxudian said that 
Amoco made ""every effort to obtain crude oil for us at a price that we could economically process and continue our business."""
295,32," Participation in an illegal boycott is, of course, not excused by the fact that a defendant was coerced into joining by threats or 
pressure from others.  United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 U.S. 131, 161, 92 L. Ed. 1260, 68 S. Ct. 915 (1948) Otto 
Milk Company v. United Dairy Farmers Cooperative Association, 388 F.2d 789 (3d. Cir. 1967) at 797.  The Supreme Court noted 
the line of cases dealing with economic coercion as a defense in Cities Service, but declined to pass on that theory because of 
the state of the record.  See footnote 16, 391 U.S. at 280, in which are cited Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 
207, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741, 79 S. Ct. 705 (1959), and United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., 362 U.S. 29, 4 L. Ed. 2d 505, 80 S. Ct. 503

defendants, in their corporate capacity, came to New York for three days during which an alleged conspiracy against the plaintiff 
was entered into, does not bring them within the venue basis of § 4."

309,8," In Fourco Glass Co. v. Transmirra Corp., 353 U.S. 222, 1 L. Ed. 2d 786, 77 S. Ct. 787 (1957), the Supreme Court concluded 
that § 1391 was inapplicable to patent infringement claims which was governed exclusively by § 1400. However, the Court 
appears to have limited Fourco to its facts, Pure Oil Co. v. Suarez, 384 U.S. 202, 16 L. Ed. 2d 474, 86 S. Ct. 1394 (1965), but 
see Leith v. Oil Transport Co., 321 F.2d 591 (3rd Cir. 1963). In Hoffman Motors Corp. v. Alfa Romeo, S. p. A., 244 F. Supp. 70 
(S.D.N.Y. 1965), the Court held § 1391 supplemented the antitrust venue provisions, citing Auburn Capitol Theatre Corp., v. 
Schine Chain Theatres, 83 F. Supp. 872 (S.D.N.Y. 1949); Anderson-Friberg, Inc. v. Justin R. Clary & Son, 98 F. Supp. 75 
(S.D.N.Y. 1951)."
309,9," None of the defendants are New York residents. Further, it is entirely unclear whether the ""claim arose"" in the Southern District.  
A cause of action under the antitrust laws can be considered as arising not from the mere combination or conspiracy, but from 
the injuries proximately resulting from the conspiracy. Electric Theater Co. v. Twentieth Century-Fox Corp., 113 F. Supp. 937 
(W.D. Mo. 1953). Plaintiff fails to specify where he acted as distributor of Berco parts, the place of injury to his business; indeed, 
from defendant's affidavit it appears plaintiff sold Berco parts only in Nebraska.  Further, the overt acts by these defendants in 
furtherance of the alleged conspiracy may well have occurred only in Pennsylvania where Shaul allegedly refused to deal with 
plaintiff.  Finally, to read into § 12 of the Clayton Act § 1391(b), providing for venue where the claim arose, would introduce an 
entirely new concept of venue into antitrust law.  The congressional retention of the limiting language ""except as otherwise 
provided by law"" indicates this result was not intended."
309,10," Some courts have found a corporation doing business if it would be amenable to process under state law.  Steiner v. Dauphin 
Corp., 208 F. Supp. 104 (E.D. Pa. 1962). Other courts consider the amount of activity necessary to warrant a finding of doing 
business should be less than that required by the jurisdictional standard.  Friedman v. United States Trunk Co., 204 F. Supp. 
366 (S.D.N.Y. 1962) aff'd, 367 F.2d 583 (2d Cir. 1966); Sunbury Wire Rope Mfg. Co. v. United States Steel Co., 230 F.2d 511 
(3rd Cir. 1956). Still other courts consider doing business as the equivalent of transaction of business. Friedman v. United States 
Trunk Co., supra. Finally, on the basis of the section's legislative history, some cases define doing business as that degree of 
activity requiring the corporation to obtain a license.  Farr's Inc. v. Nat'l Shoes Inc., 191 F. Supp. 803 (E.D. Pa. 1960); Rensing v.

336,*," The distinction is of more than academic interest.  Problems like the boycott, involved at some times in antitrust, at other times 
in Labor Board cases, are frequently matters of the utmost subtlety and difficulty.  See, e.g., National Woodwork Manufacturers 
Assoc. v. National Labor Relations Board, 386 U.S. 612, 87 S. Ct. 1250, 18 L. Ed. 2d 357 (1967), and note the several passages 
therein categorizing distinctly questions of antitrust and of labor relations law. P. 631 n. 19; also, in the dissent, pp. 652-55.  The 
two separate categories entail different substantive premises and objectives, sought through distinct and separate procedures.  
In the instant case, by way of illustration, both sides agree that the labor arbitrator was correct in leaving the antitrust question 
for judicial resolution.  But query whether he would have owed a similar diffidence had he been asked to rule on a question of 
labor relations law.  If the answer to that is yes, is it possibly because the National Labor Relations Board, rather than an 
arbitrator, should be the agency to rule, at least first, under the Labor Relations Act?  Of course, the primary authority of the 
Board is a pertinent concern for this court too, and this suggests further reason for refusing to equate antitrust law with that 
administered by the Board. "
341,1, It is unnecessary for us to set out the several aspects of the court's standard which are accepted by the parties as correct. 
342,2," Of course, we do not exclude the possibility that a non-secret item may become the subject of a process not theretofore 
generally known and therefore secret."
342,3," Though it need not do so, a trade secret may possess qualities of novelty or inventiveness but not rise to the level of patentable 
invention. Or the trade secret may be patentable and the owner seek to protect it as a trade secret rather than spread it on the 
records as a patent."
342,4," Most of the Mississippi cases are concerned with covenants not to compete, and, insofar as they involve trade secrets, the 
subject matter often has been customer lists and files of accumulated data.  E.g., Bagwell v. H. B. Wellborn and Co., 247 Miss. 
564, 156 So.2d 739 (1963); Donahoe v. Tatum, 242 Miss. 253, 134 So.2d 442 (1961); Sivley v. Cramer, 105 Miss. 13, 61 So. 
653 (1913). Where secrets are of this nature, novelty, in the sense of an advancement of knowledge, really is not involved.  
Nevertheless, the Mississippi Supreme Court in this series of cases has taken the approach of a careful balancing of interests of 
the business, the situation and objectives of the parties, the necessity of protecting the legitimate interests of employer and 
employee, and the possibility of adverse effect on the public.  When the focus is on the relationship of the parties, and the effect 
thereof, the qualities of uniqueness or inventiveness of the subject matter are of diminished importance."
342,5," Also, the court implied that it was looking at Hudson's processes and equipment, as well as Cataphote's, with an eye to 
determine if they had qualities of uniqueness. Of course, Hudson may be a non-appropriator with unique techniques and devices 
of its own, but uniqueness of its techniques and devices, in the patent law sense, is not essential for Hudson to be a non-
appropriator. "
343,6," Callman suggests the doctrine of equivalents may be applied only if the secret amounts to a ""useful, patentable invention."" 2 
Callman, supra, § 52.1, p. 375."
343,7," See also, the discussion at 77 Harv.L.Rev. 950-953, pointing out the difficulty of the case in which the technically skilled 
employee changes jobs, and his skills include information which the employer regards as confidential.  The commentator agrees 
with Callman that a firm and certain rule is unsatisfactory, and suggests several guidelines, inter alia: (1) Agency principles are 
of little help nor are concepts of ""disloyalty."" (2) What is the extent of the handicap to the employee in seeking new employment -
- is his job mobility injured?  (3) Has he himself helped to develop the trade secret and was he hired to produce it?  (4) Was he 
given a fair and explicit notice that the work on which his skills were being employed would be claimed to be protected? (5) The 
duration of the restraint.  (6) The effect on the employer's incentive to invest. "
344,8," The judge who tried the case on the merits (not the same judge as had entered the earlier judgment) correctly appraised the 
status of the case when it reached him: ""It is important to note at this stage in the proceedings that it became obvious to this Court to which the case was assigned, 
as well as to the Judge heretofore presiding, that there could be no effective restraint against defendants until such time as 
plaintiff specifically identified and proved its claimed trade secrets to be trade secrets in fact and that they had been

conceded that some form of reserve system is essential to the very maintenance of the ""joint venture"" of organized professional 
baseball. See Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U.S. 341, 10 L. Ed. 2d 389, 83 S. Ct. 1246 (1963); Chicago Board of

(9th Cir. 1966); Molinas v. National Basketball Ass'n., 190 F. Supp. 241 (S.D.N.Y. 1961). Nevertheless, the baseball reserve rule 
appears excessively restrictive (far beyond that necessary to protect its aims of insuring stability of team membership, 
maximizing fan interest, and protecting club investments in player development).  Less restrictive alternatives have been 
adopted in football, basketball and other professional sports. Accordingly, there appears a strong likelihood that the reserve 
system would be held an unreasonable restraint of trade."

(1937). Further, in light of Radovich and the expansion since 1922 of the concept of interstate commerce, we have no doubt that 
baseball is in interstate commerce. See State v. Milwaukee Braves Inc., 31 Wis. 2d 699, 144 N.W. 2d 1 (1966). "

425. Defendants argue that in any event the draft system was initiated long after plaintiff entered baseball and thus he lacks standing 
to raise this contention.  We are inclined to disagree with defendants since plaintiff concededly has standing to attack the 
reserve system and merely wishes to establish as grounds for overruling Toolson that its effect has become more restrictive as a 
result of the draft.  At least for purposes of this motion this question is resolved in plaintiff's favor."

subject to the antitrust laws (after Federal Baseball, but prior to Toolson), nevertheless refused to issue a preliminary injunction

365,51," Although the Basic Agreement is somewhat internally inconsistent on this question (the Players Association agrees generally

system is not presently collectively agreed to.  Article VIII of the Basic Agreement specifically provides for a joint review of 
possible alternatives to the reserve clause (which review is underway) and that the clubs shall not be obligated to bargain or 
seek agreement with the Players Association with respect to the reserve clause during the term of the Agreement (which is still 
in effect)."
365,52," Plaintiff may also be seeking to escape this often difficult process of reconciliation of labor and antitrust laws by contesting 
defendants' good faith in the present bargaining over the reserve system. It would appear to us that HN7[
] the recourse for any failure by defendants to bargain in good faith should be to the National Labor Relations Board which has recently asserted its jurisdiction over the defendant baseball employers.  See American 
League and Association of Umpires, 180 NLRB No. 30, Case 1-RC-10414 (December 15, 1969).  In any event, this contention

of the lower court's dismissal of the complaint was that the claimed illegality of professional football's reserve system under 
which the petitioner was barred from football constituted a labor dispute and was exempt from the antitrust laws. See Brief for 
Respondents, pp. 53-63; Petitioner's Reply Brief, pp. 20-21.  The Supreme Court, in holding professional football subject to 
federal antitrust laws and the complaint improperly dismissed, stated, ""respondents' remaining contentions we believe to be 
lacking in merit."" 352 U.S. at 454. It is significant, however, that neither party in Radovich claimed that the reserve system was a product of or subject to collective 
bargaining. See generally, Comment, ""Monopsony in Manpower: Organized Baseball Meets the Antitrust Laws,"" 62 Yale L.J. at 
619-20, 635-36 (in 1953 in baseball there was also apparently no negotiation or consultation with the players regarding the

licensee to estimate what his net selling price will be and thereby determine how much it will ultimately cost him in royalties 
depending upon the party from whom he obtains the components.  Any uncertainty created by the Sonobond licenses is de

382,1," In discussing the issues in this case, we have usually simplified the positions of the parties by considering them as producers, 
consumers, and the Commission.  Our review of the case, however, has taken into account subtler differences among the 
parties.  Most of the producers, for example, have joined a single group, the Amerada group, in briefing their argument, but 
others have chosen to present their arguments separately.  Particularly conspicuous among these separate petitioners are 
several small producers, and we have treated their special arguments herein.  The method of presentation is a question for the 
parties themselves.  We think, however, after considering this case, that it is to the great advantage of the parties in a complex, 
multi-party case to aggregate their arguments in so far as possible."
382,2," The pipelines purchase gas from the producers, and it seems anomalous at the outset that they are arguing that prices are too

factors as well.  A significant reason for the pipelines' alignment here, however, may be simply that they are concerned that the 
price level will not elicit sufficient supply for their needs.  At oral argument, they represented that informal rationing procedures 
among pipeline purchasers were now in effect and that formal agreements might be necessary in the future."

191, 194-99 (1967) (concluding that area rate regulation resembles wartime price control). These and other authorities, however, are relevant only to the quasi-legislative function of the Commission in deciding how 
producers are to be regulated.  The decisions of the Supreme Court definitely indicate that the Commission has a responsibility 
to take the steps necessary to assure that wellhead prices are in the public interest. The Commission does not have to employ 
the area rate method, or for that matter regulate price directly at all, but it has chosen to fulfill its duty in that manner here."
383,10," The Commission concluded that there was an absence of effective competition in wellhead sales.  This absence seems to be 
strongly evidenced by a rapid spiral of price increases over the years from 1950 to 1958, when the price went from less than 9 
cents per Mcf to a peak of 24.05 cents.  This spiral was apparently caused by three factors.  First, the contracting practice in the 
industry resulted in oligopolistic behavior, because devices such as favored nation, periodic escalation, redetermination, and 
renegotiation clauses caused any price above in-line levels to trigger other price rises.  (These contract terms are defined in the 
Supreme Court's Permian opinion, 390 U.S. at 765, 88 S. Ct. at 1358, n. 46.) Second, the producers were able to assert market 
power even though the market for sales to large pipelines appears at first glance to be oligopolistic, because the pipelines 
typically needed large blocks of reserves at times not of their own choosing.  Finally, the bargaining motivation of pipelines 
themselves was diluted because pipelines resold in a relatively inelastic market and hence could pass price increases on to "
384,," consumers. The Commission chose to believe this evidence rather than to focus on concentration ratios, leadership turnovers, 
or conditions of entry, and it appears to have been justified in so doing. 4 Joint Appendix at 530d-34d (Commission's Opinion). At the same time, there seems to be general agreement that the market is at least structurally competitive.  The Supreme Court 
in Permian described producers as ""intensively competitive."" 390 U.S. at 757, 88 S. Ct. at 1354. See also P. McAvoy, supra note

384,15," This date was chosen for three reasons. First, it was the most convenient date following 1960, the year of most data for old 
gas.  Secondly, the in-line and guide-line policies had been established in 1960.  Thirdly, this date reflected the Commission's 
estimate of the time at which the industry acquired the capability to drill ""directionally,"" i.e., to explore specifically for gas rather 
than finding gas as a by-product of the search for oil. 34 F.P.C. at 189. This directionality hypothesis is a major basis of area rate 
regulation as the Commission has implemented it, because multi-price regulation depends upon the function of greater prices to 
elicit gas exploration. The hypothesis is not without its critics.  See Foster Associates Report, December 18, 1969, at 9-10."
384,16," The new gas ceiling was 16.5 cents per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) in Texas or 15.5 cents per Mcf in New Mexico, and the old 
gas ceiling was 14.5 cents per Mcf in Texas or 13.5 cents per Mcf in New Mexico.  The difference reflected the fact that the "
385,," Texas price included state taxes while the New Mexico price did not.  Casinghead gas was priced at old gas ceilings irrespective 
of its vintage. The Commission also set a minimum price of 9 cents per Mcf."
385,17," The Commission made no assessment of the effect of its prices on supply, demand, reserves, or industry structure.  The 
Supreme Court advised that in future cases the Commission should state more ""fully and carefully * * * its assessment of the 
consequences of its orders for the character and future development of the industry."" 390 U.S. at 792, 88 S. Ct. at 1373."

of 37.5 percent.  Brief for Amerada Group at Appendix B-2."

386,21," The Commission ruled that, by further order, it would require refunds of the difference between the amounts collected and 
amounts that could have been received under the applicable area rate (or the amounts that would have been received under 
firm certificates or settlement rates if those rates were higher than the area rate)."

388,24," Area rates ""will be modified if a showing is made that unit costs -- reflecting amounts spent and reserves found -- have 
increased to such an extent that an increase in area rates is required."" As to individual producers, the Commission recognized 
that it was avoiding ""precise specification of circumstances that would justify special relief,"" but stated that: ""However, certain principles have been established.  Overall high cost of service of an individual producer is not a ground 
for relief.  The fact that current revenue from a particular well is less than the costs of continuing its production is a ground 
for relief.  The fact that a producer can obtain a higher price elsewhere is not a ground for relief.  Certain producers have 
already requested price relief, contending that unusually high pressure, great volume, concentrated delivery points, delivery 
of large quantities at one point, unusually high gas quality, unusually good deliverability and the availability of gas for swing 
purposes justify an increased price.  We have determined that none of these, nor all of them together, are grounds for price 
relief."" These and other statements of the Commission, taken together, probably constitute as specific an exposition of circumstances 
for relief as can be expected at this stage in area regulation."
388,25," The Commission established a system of quality discounts that were to be used in adjusting maximum rates, outlawed certain 
types of flexible pricing clauses resulting in increases over ceilings, created special exempt types of producer sales, exempted 
""small"" producers from certain requirements, and determined that minimum rates need not be established. "

for January 27, 1970. The Commission had already set part of the offshore territory for reconsideration in its opinion on rehearing.  The Order of 
December 15 enlarged that proceeding to include the entire area."
389,27," The maximum rates that the Commission has set, in addition to the moratoria, are to remain in effect throughout the new 
proceeding, which may last for years.  Moreover, it was never contemplated that there should be a single area proceeding 
setting rates once and for all; rather the Commission has always made it clear that it intended to review the rates it had set 
whenever the circumstances made it advisable to do so.  See note 24 supra."
389,28, See section III D infra.
389,29," About fourteen percent of gas produced in Southern Louisiana is casinghead, and the Commission states that ""we are well 
aware that its indicated cost is substantially below that of gas-well gas."" The ADG has calculated the difference in cost at about 3 "
390,," cents.  Assuming this figure to be correct (which we cannot really assume because joint costing of oil and gas is judgmental), the 
inclusion of casinghead gas into the computation of costs for the first vintage would result in a total decrease in first-vintage price 
from 18.5 cents to approximately 18.3 cents by our calculation, or a difference of just over one percent.  Especially in view of the 
cost-computation structure as a whole, which has frequently involved the Commission in the approximations of interpreting joint 
costs, we consider this amount de minimis, even conceding its accuracy.  But our rejection of this argument is based upon more 
fundamental considerations.  The assignment of costs to products jointly produced, as are oil and casinghead gas, is not an 
exact undertaking, and we think the Commission has acted on the basis of substantial evidence, particularly since it has set a 
rate structure under which casinghead gas of all vintages is assigned the lowest price, that of first vintage. The Supreme Court 
approved a similar calculation in Permian.  Cf. ICC, Bureau of Accounts, Statement No. 4-54, Explanation of Rail Cost Finding 
Procedures and Principles Relating to the Use of Costs, Ch. 1, pt. 4 (1954)."
390,30," It seems clear that oil, which is more valuable than a volume of gas of the same heat content, should bear more of the 
exploration and development cost.  The Commission, as its first step in assigning these costs, determined a unit by which gas 
and oil could be compared: the amount of each that is required to produce a Btu of heat.  It then determined what it called the 
""economic factor,"" which is the number of gas units that equaled in value a unit of oil. By strict computation, the Commission 
arrived at an economic factor of 4.0.  This factor would have indicated the assignment of four times as much of the cost to oil as 
to gas.  It then adjusted this factor to 3.5, however, to allow for the fact that revenues from flowing gas should be expensed 
against present drilling, which is undergoing a continuing shift away from searches directed solely at discovering oil toward 
searches directed at finding gas.  We think it is reasonable for current revenues from flowing gas to be compared with current 
expenses in exploration for new gas.  Thus the Commission adopted an allocation that assigned higher costs to exploration for 
gas than would its straight calculation, but it justified this modification by a qualitative finding that is based upon substantial 
evidence."
390,31," The consumer interests argue that these plant gathering costs should rather be assigned to those salable liquids, since they 
are incurred in producing them.  On rehearing, the Commission indicated that the allowance might have been overstated slightly, 
but that ""* * * the entire allowance is only 0.33 cents.  The amount of possible excesses does not seem worth the burden of 
further hearings on other allocation methods."" The Commission indicated that a significant portion of the 0.33 cents is 
chargeable against gas because part of the liquid revenues do not go to the producers at all but rather are paid to the leasehold, 
reducing its cost.  Another significant part is also chargeable to gas, because transportation to a plant is usually done in 
furtherance not only of liquid extraction but also of moving the gas stream itself closer to the centralized point at which it must be 
delivered.  Therefore, we agree with the Commission that possible excesses in the 0.33 cent figure, which is itself less than 2 
percent of the total price, would be de minimis, and we hold that the plant gathering allowance is based upon substantial 
evidence."
390,32," They argue that the credit of 3.5 cents for lease-extracted liquids and that of 0.50 cents for plant-extracted liquids is too low.  
The Commission calculated the lease liquid credit at 4.18 cents, but it reduced this figure to allow for a trend of decreasing 
revenues from these liquids. It reduced the plant liquids credit from a calculated 0.75 cent to 0.50 cent to allow for a duplication 
of credits elsewhere.  These actions are supported by substantial evidence."
390,33," A generous reduction for all four cost criticisms considered here, if all of them were accepted, would certainly not exceed 1.5 
cents.  Commissioner Carver, on the other hand, indicates reasonable changes that could result in an increase of 4.0 cents, if all 
were adopted, in his dissent to the opinion on rehearing.  See note 85 infra.  The inherent, unavoidably approximate nature of 
rate regulation under legislative standards has been noted by both economists and courts, including the Supreme Court in 
Permian, 390 U.S. at 790, 88 S. Ct. at 1372 n. 59; see also J. Bonbright, Principles of Public Utility Rates 27, 67 (1960).  Of 
course, the inaccuracy of pricing techniques is one reason why the FPC is required separately to determine the consequences 
of its pricing actions.  See section III(D) infra. "
391,34," HN1[
] Provided it meets other requirements of law, the Commission may employ any ""formula or combination of formulas"" it 
finds appropriate.  It may ""make the pragmatic adjustments which may be called for by particular circumstances."" FPC v. Natural 
Gas Pipeline Co., 1942, 315 U.S. 575, 586, 62 S. Ct. 736, 743, 86 L. Ed. 1037; see also Permian, 390 U.S. at 800, 88 S. Ct. at 
1377."
391,35," We recognize possible validity in the consumers' argument that Commission reliance on such matters as hurricanes in fixing a 
12 percent rate of return for Southern Louisiana is misplaced.  It might have been more appropriate to treat these matters as 
above-the-line costs (reflected, for example, in insurance premiums) rather than as a risk upon which one obtains return.  
Permian, however, indicates that arguments of this type should be addressed to the discretion of the Commission. 390 U.S. at 
811, 88 S. Ct. at 1383. Furthermore, we do not need to rely heavily upon these factors, because the Commission has advanced 
other justifications for the rate of return."
391,36," See 3 Joint Appendix, pt. 1, at 239d (Initial Decision).  The Commission relied heavily upon the examiner's findings in fixing 
the rate of return."
391,37," See G. Stigler, Capital and Rates of Return in Manufacturing Industries 90-91 (1963); cf. J. Galbraith, The New Industrial State 
(1967)."
391,38," We note at the outset that the Commission is not required to compute rate of return on the basis of the comparable earnings 
test.  The Permian decision states that ""other standards might properly have been employed."" (The Court cites with apparent 
approval the examiner's discussion of rate of return in this very case, the Southern Louisiana proceeding).  390 U.S. at 805, 88 
S. Ct. at 1380 & n. 1; see also J. Bonbright, supra, note 33, at 240-283.  However, we review the Commission's decision under 
HN2[
] the comparable earnings test because that is the standard it evidently followed. The test has been formulated as follows: Return should be ""equal to that generally being made at the same time and in the same 
general part of the country on investments in other business undertakings which are attended by corresponding risks and 
uncertainties."" Bluefield Water Works & Improvement Co. v. Public Service Commission, 1923, 262 U.S. 679, 692, 43 S. Ct. 675, 
679, 67 L. Ed. 1176; FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., 320 U.S. at 603, 64 S. Ct. at 288. "
392,39," The Amerada group of producers argued for a 16-18 percent rate of return.  The FPC Staff recommended 9.5 percent and 
asserted that 12 percent ""can well be considered as in excess of the upper limit of the range of reasonableness."" See 3 Joint 
Appendix, pt. 1, at 164d, 173d, 185d, n. 1, (Initial Decision)."
392,40," See 4 Joint Appendix, pt. 1, at 567d-74d (Commission's Opinion)."
392,41," ""We recognize that the limited available data on non-integrated companies refers to a few unusually successful producers. 
Also, earnings-book ratios of integrated companies deserve to be given some weight."" Id. at 573d."
392,42," HN3[
] The comparable earnings standard is a general one, encompassing several indicia of earnings and requiring both 
ability to attract capital and a fair return on equity.  Williams v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Comm., 1968, 134 
U.S.App.D.C. 342, 415 F.2d 922, 933. Certain types of computation are unacceptable, see Id. at 970 & n. 294, but the 
Commission has broad power to select the evidence upon which it should rely.  We find that the Commission was obviously 
attempting to apply the comparable earnings test.  The sole questions it struggled with were what companies' risks were 
comparable and what the earnings of those companies were.  Its choice of evidence is reviewable under the substantial 
evidence standard."
392,43," We are singularly unimpressed with the characterization of this offshore factor as a ""phantom tax"" by both the MDG and the 
New York Commission.  These parties begin by stating that the computed cost difference between offshore and onshore is 2.3 
cents (the amount of the Louisiana severance tax), go on to show that the Commission's ceiling for offshore is only 1.5 cents 
lower, and from this conclude that the Commission has allowed 0.8 cent for ""phantom"" taxes inapplicable to offshore, which is 
outside Louisiana's taxing jurisdiction.  The conclusion is the baldest of sophistry, for the 0.8 cent allowance has nothing to do 
with the Louisiana tax.  It is a noncost element intentionally added by the Commission, and we consider it as such. It is only fair to add, however, that this sophistry was made possible, if not plausible, by the Commission's failure to label noncost 
factors specifically and to justify them in a way clearly independent of costs.  It is also a product of conflicting implications in the 
Commission's findings.  See sections IV A(1), (4) infra.  The raising of phantom issues such as this one wastefully consumes the 
efforts of a reviewing court."
392,44," The main thrust of the MDG argument is that the Commission failed to include adequate justification for the noncost factors in 
its opinion, an argument with which we would be inclined to agree were it not for the newness of area regulation. See Colorado-
Wyoming Gas Co. v. FPC, 1945, 324 U.S. 626, 65 S. Ct. 850, 89 L. Ed. 1235; United States v. Carolina Freight Carriers Corp., "
393,1940," , 315 U.S. 475, 62 S. Ct. 722, 86 L. Ed. 971. This is a procedural issue crucial to appellate review.  See notes 110-11 infra 
and accompanying text."
393,45," All other issues remanded to the Transit Commission were so treated because of a lack of required findings, but the court 
disapproved completely the cushion in the rate of return. The Transit Commission had included the amount because of the 
possibility that its ""conservative"" cost and revenue findings might be inaccurate.  It expressed a preference for adding a cushion 
above costs to cover this possibility rather than allowing for it in its cost findings because adjustment in cost findings would be 
compounded by the addition of return.  The court did not dispute this proposition, which indeed is indisputable, but stated that 
""notwithstanding the uncertainty that attends all prophesy, a regulatory agency is duty bound to make its forecasts as accurate 
as it possibly can, and a reviewing court is entitled to assume that it has done so."""
393,46," The gas industry is different from metropolitan transit in that it requires a constant infusion of entrepreneurship of the highest 
order if even basic public needs are to be satisfied.  The D.C. Transit System will continue to operate even if the return its 
investors expect in a given year is poor, because it is a true public utility subject to the orders of the Transit Commission.  Its 
service may not be of the best quality if rates are too low, or, more importantly, its owners may have a Constitutional claim 
against the Government, but the public will not be irreparably injured.  On the other hand, we count upon persons who carefully 
weigh investment risks for our supply of natural gas. We think the Commission here, having calculated the dangers involved in 
allowing the gas supply to lapse, and the probabilities that its estimates might be too low, is justified in having added the small 
noncost factors it thought were necessary.  It found that it needed to do so to protect the public interest and not to assure any 
rights of gas producers. However, as the Williams case indicates, the use of noncost factors to allow for possible inaccuracies is 
not favored.  Inaccuracy, if that is really the concern (and not higher costs), can result in a windfall to producers as easily as in a 
loss.  See note 47 infra.  We approve the use of noncost factors for this purpose under the facts of this case only."
393,47," Williams is distinguishable from our case in several respects; it is so clearly so, in fact, that we feel justified in concluding that it 
is based not on disapproval of noncost increments but upon disapproval of egregiously inattentive regulation. The cushion had 
been added ostensibly to allow for inaccuracies in cost computations, but the court found that as the computations had been 
made any inaccuracies would lie on the side of generosity to the Transit Company.  Moreover, in earlier years regulation by the 
Transit Commission had allowed, in reality, a return of equity of 21 percent for the Company, as versus a ""comparable earnings"" 
return computed at 7.5-8.7 percent.  The Transit Commission had made no findings as to comparable earnings. 415 F.2d at 936-
937, 973-974."
393,48," 390 U.S. at 815, 88 S. Ct. at 1385 & nn. 97-99."
393,49," This argument is widely accepted; indeed, it was cited with approval in Permian.  See Id. at n. 99 and authorities therein cited. "
394,50," These considerations are in apparent conflict with the Commission's finding that ""it has not been demonstrated that the unit 
cost of gas is greater offshore than onshore."" 4 Joint Appendix, pt. 1, at 622d. The Commission could have reconciled this 
conflict by indicating, for example, that it had some reason for thinking costs might be higher, or that the newness of the 
undertaking and the consequent unavailability of cost data was itself a risk justifying a higher return."
394,51," This finding should have been discussed in light of the Commission's finding that costs were unlikely to rise.  Evidently the 
Commission recognized some probability that costs would rise slightly, and the amount of the cushion is tied to this probability -- 
but the Commission has not exposed its reasoning."
394,52," Cf. 390 U.S. at 815, 88 S. Ct. 1385, 20 L. Ed. 2d 312 n. 98."
394,53," The Supreme Court affirmed in Permian, however, while being forced to read the Commission's mind even more than we are.  
The Commission there had said that ""no [noncost] adjustments are required in the Permian Basin."" 34 F.P.C. at 207. But the 
Supreme Court found that the Commission had actually used four separate types of noncost factors and had justified each.  390 
U.S. at 815, 88 S. Ct. at 1385 n. 98."
394,54," Noncost factors will often in the ultimate analysis relate to these market variables, although there are other possible 
justifications for them.  Where noncost elements are used to relate supply and demand, the level of each and the relationship 
between them must be explored.  Here, adequate supply, even though the Commission has not examined it, is obviously a 
major consideration lurking behind the noncost additions, expressed in the Commission's frequent allusions to the ""importance"" 
of the Southern Louisiana area.  A finding as to ""importance,"" without any identification of or discussion of the specific 
characteristic of the region that is important, is of little benefit to a reviewing court."

395,59," The argument is based upon the following two contentions: first, that sections 7 and 8 of the APA, read in conjunction with 
section 4 of the Natural Gas Act, require rate orders to be made upon formal hearing and not upon the ""informal"" procedures 
established here, and second, that the issuance of the moratorium order was not preceded by the public notice required by 
section 4(b) and other sections of the APA.  The answer to the first argument is that the instant proceeding is the rate order 
required to comply with sections 7 and 8; we do not think these sections apply to the decision whether to grant individual relief 
after the just and reasonable rates have been set.  This is the clear import of the Permian approval of group regulation. See 390 
U.S. at 744, 88 S. Ct. at 1364, distinguishing Bowles v. Willingham, supra. The second argument likewise has no merit.  The

396,66," Certain of the producers urge that §§ 4 and 5 must in combination be understood to preclude moratoria upon filings under § 
4(d).  They assert that the period of effectiveness of a rate determination under § 5(a) is limited by § 4(e); they reason that § 4(d) 
creates an unrestricted right to file rate changes, and that such changes may, under § 4(e), be suspended for a period no longer 
than five months.  If this construction were accepted, it would follow that area proceedings would terminate in rate limitations that 
could be disregarded by producers five months after their promulgation.  The result, as the Commission observed, would be that "
397,," ""the conclusion of one area proceeding would only signal the beginning of the next, and just and reasonable rates for consumers 
would always be one area proceeding away."" 34 F.P.C., at 228. 390 U.S. at 781, 88 S. Ct. at 1367. The same conditions, of 
course, are present here."
397,67," It is to be emphasized that the moratorium provisions do not prohibit increased rate filings.  They prohibit rate filings in excess 
of the ceilings.  These ceilings are the maximum prices that the Commission feels can be considered just and reasonable.  The 
Commission has added noncost increments to the rates that present the greatest danger of inadequacy, and it has provided 
avenues of extraordinary relief, both industrywide and on an individual-producer basis, whereby the moratoriums may be lifted.  
We do not think that the moratorium provisions, which are necessary to the area regulation process, ""write section 4 out of the 
Act,"" as the producers have contended."
397,68," These two considerations can also be extracted from the following Permian language: ""We cannot, given the apparent stability 
of production costs, the Commission's relative inexperience with area regulation, and the administrative burden of concurrent 
area proceedings, hold that this [moratorium] arrangement was impermissible."" 390 U.S. at 781, 88 S. Ct. at 1367."
397,69," Moreover, the Tenth Circuit had stayed the moratorium order and it consequently had no effect at all throughout its duration, 
390 U.S. at 777, 88 S. Ct. at 1365."
397,70," Specifically, considerations relating to the law of the case should be accorded only limited significance, since experience with 
area regulation may increase to such an extent as to constitute a change in circumstances. "
398,71," Theoretically speaking, the indefinite nature of the moratorium will assert itself only in the future.  Practically, it will have some 
effect on industry expectations and hence industry conduct.  But since the new proceedings before the Commission create 
expectations that ceilings may be changed, we consider the present effect of the indefinite moratorium to be minimal."
398,71," A We reiterate, as the producers seem to lose sight of the fact, that the Commission is not required to compute return by the 
comparable earnings test.  See note 38 supra."
398,72," The producers' most easily comprehended presentation is a graph over the years 1947 to 1968 of rates of return they 
considered comparable. The 1958-1962 period chosen by the Commission is decidedly a dip in the curve, reflecting a recession 
during these years.  Also, the producers attack the Commission's choice of companies to compare and failure to consider 
evidence showing a rise in earnings since 1963. Persuasive evidence, however, supports the Commission's action, and we are 
not engaged in finding these facts anew. Furthermore, the rate of return even as set may be higher than 12 percent.  Non-cost factors, if they are viewed as additions to 
the return -- and this is a logical way to view them, since they must go either to pay costs or to increase return -- would increase 
return to 14-16 percent for new gas.  Earnings on equity at a 12 percent rate on capital, of course, are higher than 12 percent 
because they are leveraged by debt; here they amount to about 13.3 percent.  Finally, the producers' argument for a 16-18 
percent rate of return is defective because it includes early years in which very high returns -- well over 20 percent -- distort the 
figure so that it is unreliable for present use."
398,73," Imprecision is, however, one of the reasons for the requirement that a regulatory body reassess its rates in terms of purpose 
and consequences. See section IV A (3) infra. "

divided among the carriers on the basis of costs for both territories taken together if the costs of lines in one territory distort the

unadjusted costs for either territory or for the whole are not substantial evidence."

Commission has followed the cost method in this case, and we cannot reverse its decision here. We have inspected the Commission's findings as to each of the cost items attacked by the producers with some care.  Although 
we do not discuss each individually in order not to lengthen an already lengthy discussion (cf. notes 29-32 supra), we find each 
to be supported by substantial evidence."
401,86," 4 Joint Appendix, pt. 1, at 1000d (dissenting opinion).  The Commissioner stated that he could not decide this case on the 
basis of any cost record. In light of the imprecision of costs, broad support for the settlement, evidence that the market has at least a procompetitive 
structure, and cumbersome nature of price regulation, it may be that the settlement arguments advanced by Commissioner 
Carver are persuasive.  In this case, the settlement is championed by the producers, and before the Commission it was 
supported by gas distributors (whom we classify as representing consumer interests) accounting for over 87 percent of delivery 
volume.  Id. at 1001d.  Widespread use of the settlement technique would result in negotiation pitting market forces against each 
other on an aggregate scale, overseen by the Commission. "
402,87," HN13[
] It is not theory but the impact of the rate order which counts.  If the total effect of the rate order cannot be said to be 
unjust and unreasonable, judicial inquiry under the Act is at an end.  The fact that the method employed to reach that result may 
contain infirmities is not then important. FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., supra, 320 U.S. at 602, 64 S. Ct. at 288. In keeping with this statement, we would not have such serious misgivings about affirming this order, with all the infirmities of the 
Commission's pricing methods, if the Commission had adequately considered its result in a larger context.  A reviewing court, 
which is not privy to the Commission's special knowledge, is not likely to be able to make the assessment of results that the 
Commission could.  We are troubled greatly by the fall in the FP ratio, for example, and cannot know whether it is so serious as 
to warrant some immediate, extraordinary action by this Court.  The point is that without adequate consideration by the 
Commission of ultimate market impact, even slight troublesome facts assume fearful proportions.  In this case, the producers, as 
well as the FPC Staff, predict a severe gas shortage, with disastrous effects on consumers and the economy alike.  This Court 
has little inclination to join the Commission in presiding over such a result."
402,88," Indeed, the Hope case interprets the policy of the Act as involving both consumer interests and the autonomous interests of 
the industry.  HN14[

402,90," The Commission's most specific finding as to demand appears to be that ""there seems no doubt that natural gas will be a 
major and vital source of energy for many years to come."" 4 Joint Appendix, pt. 1, at 664d.  This assessment is practically 
useless and should be made with far greater specificity in future proceedings. The Commission also stated that ""we must reject the findings-to-production and reserves-to-production ratios as not 
substantially indicative for fixing ceiling rates in this proceeding."" 4 Joint Appendix, pt. 1, at 529d.  But see note 122 infra.  The 
ratios need not have been directly considered in price computation, but the effect of the price on them should have been 
assessed. "
403,91," We agree that the econometric studies were fatally defective, for the reasons set out in the examiner's decision. 3 Joint 
Appendix, pt. 1, at 380d-408d.  Their most basic and serious defect is their tacit underlying hypothesis that demand will call forth 
sufficient exploration to meet it regardless of cost or profit considerations.  The examiner quoted the following argument 
advanced by Amerada:"
403,*," * * Thus, Staff's projections indicate that total exploratory wells in 1970 will be 8,900 at the 17 cents assumed national 
average ceiling price and with competing fuel prices remaining proportional.  A 14 cents ceiling price would yield 10,130 
exploratory wells while a 20 cents ceiling price indicates only 8,380 would be drilled. Turning to the same year and under 
the same assumptions, Staff's alternative model suggests 624 successful gas exploratory wells will be drilled in 1970 if 
prices remain at current levels, with 742 at a 21 cents ceiling and 581 at a 22 cents ceiling. Even more wells are predicted 
to be drilled at lower ceiling prices such as 10 cents per Mcf.  However, there is nothing in Staff's economic hypothesis or in 
the exploratory equations utilized which requires that we stop at the 10 cents assumed ceiling price.  Thus, the Staff 
equation at a 2 cents ceiling price would predict that the industry would in 1970 drill 268,310 exploratory wells (Ex. 156, p. 
9). This, of course, is more exploratory wells than have been drilled in total since 1940.  The reason for such absurd results is 
that Staff's exploratory equation fails to consider any cost related to exploration or production; it continues to blindly forecast 
increases in production due to the supposed stimulating effect of low price on demand."" (Amerada reply brief, pp. 21-22) Although we approve the Commission's action in rejecting these studies, we do not approve of its failure to consider supply in 
relation to demand.  It should be pointed out that in doing so the Commission has itself committed an error similar to Staff's. The 
error is not so serious as that of utterly failing to consider the profit incentive, but the Commission has assumed, without 
supporting findings, that the cost-plus-return price will be sufficiently profitable to elicit supply to meet demand, whatever the 
level of demand.  This is circular pricing. If demand rises and cannot be satisfied out of reservoirs that are easily enough found 
to allow the entrepreneur his profit, demand will not be satisfied.  Having found that rigorous mathematical equations could not 
solve this problem, the Commission should have confronted it in a semiquantitative or qualitative way."
403,92," See 4 Joint Appendix, pt. 1, at 667d-73d."
403,93," We do not think reviewing courts should accept such conclusionary findings as this after the ""experiment"" justification for 
affirmance no longer applies.  The Commission should have looked directly to sources and availability of capital. "
404,94," 4 Joint Appendix, pt. 1, at 683d.  The finding as to the total expected revenue is commendably specific.  However, it is useless

concluded without more that this figure will ""foster an active exploratory program."""

ratio should be kept at a minimum of 20 to 1, and there was substantial evidence that lower ratios were acceptable.  The Court 
evaluated the significance of these ratios as follows: Nothing in the record establishes as proper or even minimal any particular ratio. We do not suggest, nor did the 
Commission, that the Commission should not continuously assess the level and success of exploration, or that the 
relationship between reserves and production is not a useful bench-mark of the industry's future.  We hold only that the 
Commission here permissibly discounted the producers' reliance upon this relationship to establish the inadequacy of its 
rate structure."

405,101," A critical ratio will ultimately be reached in each area below which the RP ratio cannot be decreased, meaning that at that 
point production cannot be increased without reserve additions, according to the Staff Report.  But reserve levels at any given 
time are determined by previous levels of exploration, and there is a lag before new exploration results in addition of usable 
reserves.  Staff has calculated the critical RP ratio for Southern Louisiana at approximately 8.  It has projected the future of the 
RP ratio and determined that the critical level will be reached about 1973 or 1974 under a ""business as usual"" regulatory 
program.  At that time production, having kept up with demand, will not be capable of being increased, and deficiencies will 
come about which production from other areas will not be able to pick up because of lack of delivery lines and because they will 
be approaching the critical ratio. See Staff Report at 14-17."
405,102, Staff Report at 4.
405,103," The supply of natural gas is, of course, ultimately limited not by exploration but by the amount of recoverable reserves.  The 
Potential Gas Committee, a group of experts from all segments of the gas industry, has recently estimated the total recoverable 
reserves in and offshore to the United States and Alaska at 1,227 trillion cubic feet, divided into probable supply, possible 
supply, and speculative supply.  Consumption in 1968 was 19 trillion cubic feet.  Address by Commissioner O'Connor, supra 
note 98.  In other words, production for something over sixty years would exhaust this estimated supply even at present levels.  
The situation is aggravated by (1) growing demand and (2) increasing difficulty of finding reserves as one goes from probable to 
speculative supply areas.  See Terry, Future Life of the Natural Gas Industry, in Economics of the Gas Industry 275 (Southwest 
Legal Foundation ed. 1962).  Of course, supply from other countries, pipelined in or brought in as liquid (LNG), synthetic gas, 
and other sources, could have an impact on this problem.  Staff Report at 47-76.  Farsighted gas regulation, however, would 
take into account the rational development of this depletable supply, perhaps even to the extent of having that development 
influence present area rates.  See note 121 infra."

troubled him and troubles us.  We agree, as did Justice Douglas, that the Commission may certainly use average costs, but it 
should make some finding of effects so that it will be sure that their use is in the public interest. The majority opinion in Permian 
is authority for the proposition that the Commission does not have to make the assessment Justice Douglas would have 
required, but the making of that assessment would by no means be incompatible with the majority opinion and would be in the

409,117, See Staff Report at 11 (chart showing past and projected production).  Staff forecasts about six percent.
409,118," This proposition, we think, is a logical corollary of the proposition that cost pricing is ultimately circular.  See notes 48-49, 91, 
supra.  If present demand is satisfied at a price at which only promising areas are explored, there is no assurance that the same 
price will cause higher demand to be satisfied.  Indeed, there is assurance that it will not if increased production requires 
exploration of less promising (i.e., more expensive) areas, because entrepreneurs will not explore those areas. The Commission has found that there are huge virgin areas in Southern Louisiana ""untouched by the drill,"" but this finding, 
without more, does not show that these areas will be developed to satisfy increasing demand at the price set."
409,119," In particular, it should make predictions as to the probability of an anomaly in the supply-demand relationship, such as the 
imminent reaching of a critical ratio. See Staff Report at 15."
409,120," We are well aware that the producers have not helped the Commission to make this prediction.  See 4 Joint Appendix, pt. 1,

power to use it to provide for the orderly consumption of limited reserves.  Cf. note 103 supra."

419,2," For example, in the critical area of product and specification approval, the federal government maintains elaborate independent 
testing services and a system of appeals to the Comptroller General for suppliers aggrieved by decisions of the contracting 
authority.  See R. Nash and J. Cibinic, Federal Procurement Law, 170-177 (1966).  State and local authorities, however, 
sometimes delegate this function entirely to so-called ""strong"" architects hired to supervise a particular project."
419,3," Paddock feels that these allegations are not germane, in part because deception does not vitiate an otherwise valid Noerr 
defense, 365 U.S. at 145, and in part because Whitten has not challenged the validity of Paddock's patent.  Noerr, apart, 
however, we think systematic tale-tellling coupled with other relevant factors such as conspiracy or monopoly power may 
constitute an antitrust violation.  We also doubt whether one must as a matter of law challenge the validity of a patent in order to "
420,," complain of the uses to which it is put. Cf. United States v. Singer Manufacturing Co., 374 U.S. 174, 10 L. Ed. 2d 823, 83 S. Ct. 
1773 (1963)."
420,4," HN2[
] While the two doctrines are often treated as one, we agree with Paddock's separate treatment of each.  The two are 
not coterminous.  For example, an unsuccessful attempt to influence government action may fall within the Noerr-Pennington 
immunity, but not the Parker immunity. Conversely, a state regulatory agency may decide to restrain competition without 
prompting; the beneficiaries, not having solicited government action, would enjoy a Parker immunity but not one based on Noerr-
Pennington.  Moreover, because of its First Amendment overtones, the Noerr-Pennington immunity is arguably broader than the 
Parker exemption."
420,5," Paddock has cited one lower court decision, United States v. Johns-Manville Corp., 259 F. Supp. 440 (E.D. Pa. 1966), which 
involved substantially similar facts and raised, among others, the precise issue raised here.  The court, relying on Noerr and 
Pennington, granted summary judgment for defendant without extended analysis.  For reasons which we express in the text, we 
disagree with this broad application of the Noerr-Pennington rule. "

423,7," Some have been troubled by the fact that the mineowners approached not only the Secretary of Labor, but also the TVA.  See 
Note, Application of the Sherman Act to Efforts to Influence Government Action, 81 Harv. L. Rev. 847, 853 (1968). However, 
since the TVA had the power to undermine the Secretary's decision by making ""spot market"" purchases from low wage 
operators, the mineowners' conduct seems a reasonable addendum to the main proceedings before the Secretary."
423,8," Unlike Paddock, we do not read Continental Ore to mean that any action by a Canadian public official would have resulted in 
exemption. An anti-competitive practice may receive only the most cursory inspection by public officials, see Woods Exploration 
Co. v. Alcoa, 36 F.R.D. 107 (S.D. Texas 1963), or public officials may approve conduct without consideration or awareness of its 
anti-competitive aspects.  Cf. Angle v. Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Rwy. Co., 151 U.S. 1, 38 L. Ed. 55, 14 S. Ct. 
240 (1893). The issue in such cases is not whether the action was in form ""governmental"", but whether the real decision makers 
were public officials or private businessmen.  See American Bar Association, 1955-1968 Antitrust Developments, 211-12 (1968). "
424,9," Our reliance on state bidding statutes should not be taken as approval of Whitten's argument that Paddock's selling efforts fall 
within the Sherman Act because Paddock's specifications are illegal under state bidding statutes.  State law on the validity of 
restrictive specifications varies widely. 63 C.J.S. Municipal Corporations § 1149: 43 Am. Jur. Public Works and Contracts §§ 16-
17.  We do not, therefore, equate immunity with legality under state law.  Rather, we rely on bidding statutes as clear indicia that 
government is acting as a consumer rather than as a regulator. "
425,10," In advancing this argument, Paddock places heavy reliance on the deposition of Mr. George Whitten, president of Whitten, 
Inc., who admitted that he did not intend to allege that Paddock refused to sell its gutter system unless the purchaser also 
agreed to buy accessory equipment.  This admission, however, must be qualified by Mr. Whitten's later allegation that Paddock 
has engaged in discriminatory pricing which had the effect of a refusal to deal.  Moreover, a seller need not refuse to sell his 
tying product outright in order to induce purchasers to enter an illegal tying agreement; he may, for example, offer discounts for 
those who purchase both tying and tied products or threaten litigation against those who refuse to accept the whole package.  
Mr. Whitten's admission does not, therefore, dispose of the tying issue as a matter of law. "
430,1," Because § 5(11) applies to this case, it is not necessary to deal with the Estate of L.A. Love's separately-submitted motion to 
dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.  Likewise, defendant Scheitel, though not a party to these motions, is protected by § 5(11).  
Finally, since summary judgment for all defendants is required by § 5 (11), there is no need to deal with the other grounds 
offered by defendants."

435,16," It is surprising that Investors does not point to the language contained in § 5a of the Act, 49 U.S.C. § 5b(9), to support its 
textual interpretation of § 5(11).  Section 5a, which was enacted in 1948 as part of the Reed-Bulwinkle Act, confers upon carriers 
relief from the operation of the antitrust laws insofar as rate-making agreements are concerned.  The parties to such agreements 
are relieved ""with respect to the making of such agreements, and with respect to the carrying out"" of them as well.  It might be 
argued that had Congress intended to extend such explicit retroactive immunity for acquisition agreements, it would have 
amended § 5(11) - which was first enacted in 1920 - to contain the same language as to the ""making"" of agreements.  However, 
this ""arguable"" contention is not persuasive, in view of the other factors discussed infra."
435,17," In invoking Carnation, plaintiff apparently is relying on a somewhat ambiguous footnote in the opinion of the three-judge court 
in this case, in which that court stated (287 F. Supp. at 385, n. 25): ""In view of our holding that the Commission's order is supported by substantial evidence . . . the acquisitions themselves 
are exempted from the anti-trust law, 49 U.S.C. § 5(11).  Thus plaintiff's anti-trust remedies, if any, are limited to the period

817, 818 (1965), where, unlike this case, the issue was whether certain post-approval activities came within the immunity clause 
of the Civil Aeronautics Act. "
438,19," Plaintiff's reliance on United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 10 L. Ed. 2d 915, 83 S. Ct. 1715 (1963), is 
similarly misplaced, for there the Supreme Court carefully contrasted the absence of an express immunity provision in the Bank 
Merger Act with the presence of such a provision, viz., § 5(11), in the Interstate Commerce Act. 374 U.S. at 350."
438,20," Cf. note 16, supra. "
439,21," The Pan American decision involved the issue, or application, of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, which is not relevant here, 
since the I.C.C. has already acted upon the acquisition. Nevertheless, the principles enunciated in Pan American are directly 
applicable here. "
441,22," While there has been no determination that defendants did or did not make misrepresentations to the Internal Revenue 
Service, it appears that plaintiff is making no headway in its efforts to secure relief from the Service.  In Par. 61 of Burt's Affidavit, 
plaintiff's president states that on February 7, 1969 he was advised by telephone that the Internal Revenue Service office in 
North Carolina was rescinding the tax-free ruling letter.  In Paragraphs 63-64 Burt states that he wrote to the Internal Revenue 
Service about this information, but has not yet received a reply.  It is now almost one year later. The court believes it is entitled to 
conclude that if the Internal Revenue Service had advised Burt that it was in fact going to rescind the ruling, Burt would have 
informed the court."
441,23," Plaintiff claims that Marnell v. United Parcel Service of America, Inc., 260 F. Supp. 391 (N. D. Calif. 1966), establishes that no 
""repugnancy"" would result here if defendants were held liable under the antitrust laws. However, Marnell involved the question of 
primary jurisdiction; the I.C.C. there had not yet appraised the rates and practices in question.  Here, the I.C.C. already has ruled 
on the acquisition that is the heart of plaintiff's complaint.  It was entitled to do so under § 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act. And 
by so doing, it enabled defendants to do what the defendants in Marnell could not, viz., invoke the specific, express exemptive 
provision of § 5(11). "

determine whether there was an actual restraint of competition at that time. "

453,3," We are aware that in United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd., 302 F. Supp. 1 (D.D.C. 1969), a district court read Schwinn as 
imposing a per se rule with respect to every post-sale restraint on alienation regardless of market context or purpose.  We are 
not convinced, however, that the Supreme Court intended, for example, that an automobile manufacturer using wholesale 
intermediate sellers must permit distribution of automobiles through beauty parlors or barber shops rather than through dealers 
offering appropriate pre-sale and post-sale service.  Other examples can be imagined.  We do not believe that in the age of 
""consumerism"" the Supreme Court intended so drastic a reduction of the areas in which a manufacturer may exercise 
responsibility to the consumer as is suggested in Glaxo.  The restraint in Glaxo, moreover, operates in quite a different market "
454,," context, since the patents there involved provide protection from interbrand competition and the addition of the restraint had the 
added effect of limiting intrabrand competition.  Neither situation is present in the instant case. "

the Bar of the City of New York on April 8, 1969, 44 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 1069, 1079 (Dec. 1969): ""It might be argued that parties are 
always free to settle a litigation on whatever terms they see fit, and therefore it follows they can do the lesser thing (less in the 
sense of undermining the public interest by essentially private disposition) and thus agree to submit a case to arbitration. 
However, the emphasis on the 'settlement' analogy is misplaced when used to uphold application of broad arbitration clauses to 
antitrust disputes that have not yet arisen. With respect to settlement, the events leading up to the controversy have already 
occurred; hence there is no problem (as there often would be with arbitration clauses) of a party, because of unequal bargaining 
power, agreeing to a waiver of future rights without knowing exactly what those rights will be."""
464,9," In general the remarks at the symposium referred to in note 8 were in accord with the rules set forth in the cases supra.  The 
General Counsel of the American Arbitration Association urged a re-examination of the decisions holding arbitration and antitrust 
incompatible and suggested that the decision of the district court in this case ""had much to commend it"".  In referring to the 
present state of the law, however, he said: ""There is almost unanimous concurrence by ample judicial authorities that arbitrators 
are not permitted to resolve violations of antitrust laws, and it makes no difference whether the dispute involves a collective 
agreement, or whether state or federal antitrust policy is under consideration.  Academicians and commentators are content with 
leaving the 'mystiques' of arbitration and antitrust as singular and incompatible."" (44 N.Y.L. Rev. at 1097). "

by a municipal or justice court in the same county or city and county.' (Emphasis added.) The effect of this paragraph is to qualify 
the second paragraph of section 396 as to superior courts only. It gives such courts the discretion either to transfer back to the 
municipal courts or retain jurisdiction where what otherwise would he a lack of jurisdiction is 'determined at the trial or bearing.'"" (

subcontractor's bid to a competing subcontractor prior to award, and the practice of 'bid shopping' which refers to such 
disclosure for the same purpose after an award has been made to a general contractor. ""IV. In order to combat the practices aforesaid, and as a service to contractors in the construction trades, whether members of

analyzed as follows: ""In the Inland Bid Depository case, the court held that group boycotts were illegal per se, constituting 
restraints on trade in violation of the Cartwright Act. The court further held that a bid depository could not be allowed to operate 
under rules which (1) prevent, preclude or in any manner limit any subcontractor from submitting a bid to a general contractor or 
awarding authority on any construction project at any time prior to the time set by the awarding authority for the receipt of bids 
upon any such construction project (2) limit or restrict, in any way, the amount of a bid submitted by a subcontractor to a general 
contractor or awarding authority at any time prior to the time set by the awarding authority for the receipt of bids upon a 
construction project; or (3) limit or in any way prevent a general contractor or awarding authority from receiving or considering 
any bid which is or may be submitted to him by a subcontractor at any time prior to the time set by the awarding authority for the 
receipt of bids upon a construction project."" (272 A.C.A. at p. 450, 77 Cal. Rptr. at p. 380.)"
484,11," In Carl N. Swenson Co. v. E. C. Braun Co., supra, 272 A.C.A. 447, 77 Cal. Rptr. 378, the court upheld a judgment which 
denied the general contractor the right to recover from a subcontractor on an arbitration award made under bid depository rules 
following the allegedly improper withdrawal of the subcontractor's bid. (Cf.  Drennan v. Star Paving Co. (1958) 51 Cal. 2d 409, 
415, 333 P.2d 757.) The court concluded that analysis of rules which limited the time and the manner in which a subcontractor's 
bid could be withdrawn ""effectively demonstrates that said provisions, when viewed in the context of the other bid depository 
rules which prohibit depository users from submitting or receiving bids outside the depository, do tend to stifle competition 
between subcontractors and do further an illegal restraint of trade within the meaning of the Inland Bid Depository case."" (272 
A.C.A. at p. 453, 77 Cal. Rptr. at pp. 381-82.) In that case a bearing was denied by the Supreme Court on June 25, 1969, 
Tobriner, J. voting for hearing. (See Tobriner & Jaffe, Revision of the Anti-Trust Laws (1932) 20 Cal.L.Rev. 585.) This refusal to 
examine the questions presented in the Inland Bid Depository case insofar as they were carried forward in the later case, may 
be balanced against the denial of a bearing by the Supreme Court in Associated Plumbing Contractors of Marin etc. Counties, 
Inc. v. F. W. Spencer & Son, Inc. (1963) 213 Cal. App. 2d 1, 28 Cal. Rptr. 425, when the court stated, "" * * * the trial court 
properly concluded that such restraints of trade as existed under the rules of the two associations were reasonable restraints of 
trade in the public interest and justified by the circumstances."" (213 Cal. App. 2d at p. 8, 28 Cal. Rptr. at p. 429.) "
485,12," In fact the admitted facts tend to support a contrary finding. The defendant, which apparently considered itself free to shop the 
bids received from him prior to the award of the general contract, was apparently only able to secure more favorable terms in 
three of the seven categories in which he requested and accepted bids. That he secured more favorable terms is an assumption 
that goes beyond the admitted facts. From all that appears the general contractor may have rejected the bids tendered for steel 
decking by the bid depository, and the subcontractors be selected for painting and carpeting may in fact have been selected for 
an equal price or on terms which permitted an equal or greater price if the general contractor was successful in getting the 
award. See, Note, op. cit., fn. 1, supra, 53 Va.L.Rev. at page 1724, ""As bid shopping becomes widespread in a given area, subs puff 
their instant bids to leave room for later negotiations, thus fictionalizing the bidding process."" (See also id., pp. 1732-1733 and 
1738-1739.) See, Note, op. cit., fn. 1, supra, 39 N.Y.U.L.Rev. at p. 818, ""The more trouble the general contractor and subcontractor have in 
binding each other, the more the awarding authority-the third party with an interest in the bidding-may be hurt, either by having to 
pay a higher price or by not getting the best product for his money."" (See, also, id., pp, 825-826.) See, Schultz, op. cit., fn. 1 above, 19 U. of Ch.L.Rev. at pp. 280-281, and at p. 285, where he states, ""Possibly, the firm offer 
provision will be a boon to the owner, the one whom sub and general are supposed to serve, in terms of more efficient 
construction at lower costs."" "
486,13," The Court of Appeals noted, ""It was suggested that Rule V alone constituted a per se violation of Section 1; however, since 
the decision was based on the combined effect of Rules V, III and VIII, and their implementation, we need not determine whether 
a per se violation occurred."" (352 F.2d at p. 819, fn. 5.)"
486,14," ""6. SUBMISSION OF BIDS: ""a Any subcontractor or supplier desiring to submit a bid to any person or persons through the Bid Depository shall submit to the 
Bid Depository a separate and sealed bid addressed to each general contractor to whom the subcontractor or supplier desires to 
bid and shall file with the Bid Custodian in a separate and sealed envelope addressed to the Bid Depository an identical copy of 
each such bid filed by him. ""B. Any general contractor who has received or solicited a bid direct from a subcontractor in a particular craft or supplier in a 
particular classification upon any project and who desires to use the facilities of the Bid Depository upon that project for receiving 
competitive bids in that craft or classification, shall submit to the Bid Depository such bid in a separate and sealed envelope 
addressed to the general contractor and shall file with the Bid Custodian in a separate and sealed envelope addressed to the Bid 
Depository an identical copy of each such bid filed by him, indicating on both the envelopes and the bid forms the subcontractor 
or supplier whose bid is being submitted and the craft or classification covered by the bid. ""c. A general contractor may submit through the Bid Depository in his own behalf a bid for any craft or classification as he may 
elect. Such bid submitted shall be considered on the same basis as other bids the general contractor shall receive through the 
Bid Depository from subcontractors or suppliers covering the same portion of work. In the event such general contractor's bid is 
lower by 10%, or less, of the next low bid submitted through the Bid Depository by the subcontractors or suppliers, the general 
contractor shall award the contract to the subcontractor or supplier submitting the low bid through the Bid Depository in 
accordance with the agreement entered into by the general contractor and the subcontractor or supplier at the time of delivery of 
bids. If the bid of the general contractor is low by more than 10% of the next low bid submitted through the Bid Depository, he 
may either award the contract to the subcontractor or supplier submitting the low bid through the Bid Depository in accordance 
with the agreement entered into by the general contractor and the subcontractor or supplier at the time of delivery of bids or he 
may perform the work with his own work forces. "
487,," ""d. Each of the sealed envelopes shall on its outside cover specify the project upon which the lad is made and the portion of the 
work on the project covered by the bid."""
487,15," ""13. GENERAL CONTRACT ADJUSTMENT: In the event that the awarding authority, after general bid opening, but prior to 
award, negotiates with the general contractor for changes in plans and specifications resulting in a revision downward of the 
general contract price, the general contractor shall negotiate such changes with the low bidder submitting bids through the 
Depository in each particular craft or classification involved. In case no agreement is reached as the result of such negotiations, 
bids for the particular craft(s) or classification (a) involved shall he resubmitted through the Bid Depository."" "
488,16," Judge Yankwich also authored United States v. San Francisco Electrical Const. Assn. (N.D.Cal.So.Div.1944) 57 F. Supp. 57 
and United States v. Heating, Piping & Air Conditioning Contractors Assn. (S.D.Cal.Cent.Div.1940) 33 F. Supp. 978. In the latter 
case he recognized that collusion between bidders, or bidders and others, price rigging, and division of the work are abuses 
which should be struck down whether they utilize a bid depository or not. (See also Local 175 etc. v. United States (6th Cir. 
1955) 219 F.2d 431; Las Vegas Merchant Plumbers Assn. v. United States (9th Cir. 1954) 210 F.2d 732; United States v.

an inducement to the withdrawal of any bid submitted through a bid depository operated by the defendants, or any of them, after

the Awarding Authority, unless, prior to general bid opening: ""1. The subcontractor or supplier gives notice to all general contractors to whom he has bid of a substantial mistake, which 
notice shall constitute revocation of the bids, and he shall likewise immediately give such notice to the Bid Depository or Bid 
Custodian, or ""2. The bid appears on its face to a bidding general contractor that it is an obvious and substantial mistake, in which case that 
general contractor shall immediately notify the subcontractor or supplier giving the bid of the apparent mistake. The

shall be due and payable thirty (80) days after the time of the award of the contract by the general contractor to such 
subcontractor or supplier. If paid within ten (10) days of the date of billing, there is a 5% discount allowable. ""In the event a general contractor deposits a bid with the Bid Depository which has been received by him direct or solicited by

awarding authority. Said fee shall be due and payable thirty (30) days after the time of the award of the contract by the general 
contractor to the said subcontractor or supplier. If paid within ten (10) days of date of billing, there is a 5% discount allowable. ""The Bid Depository Fees herein provided may be decreased but not increased by authorization of the Bid Depository

person who is delinquent in the payment of any fee provided in Rules 8 and 10 to use the facilities of the Bid Depository until all

493,21," Similarly the conclusion of a learned and experienced author that ""These provisions clearly and plainly violate the antitrust 
laws, * * *"" (Orick, op. cit., 19 Hastings L.J. at p. 522) must he read as referring conjunctively rather than severally to the four 
types of rules which he lists. Since he refers to rules in which the subcontractors boycott nonusing general contractors, and in 
which generals utilizing the depository boycott nonusing subcontractors, his observations are not controlling in this case. "
496,1," The court takes judicial notice of the fact that, after the closing of testimony in this case, the Department of Justice filed a 
complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in an action entitled ""United States of America 
v. The Hearst Corporation"" No. 67 Civ. 4598, which charges the Hearst Corporation with a violation of section 1 of the Sherman 
Act in that for the past many years it has entered into contracts through its King Features Syndicate Division with newspapers for 
the exclusive licensing of the features within an arbitrary and unreasonably broad territory surrounding the newspapers' city of 
publication. "
497,2," During this trial, the court reserved decision concerning the admissibility into evidence of certain documents offered on behalf 
of the government.  In general, these documents are memoranda circulated between executives of King and, in some cases, are 
personal memoranda of Mr. Nicht of King.  Some of these documents have been offered on the theory that they embody 
statements of co-conspirators made in furtherance of and in the course of the conspiracy. Mindful that there must be 
independent evidence that the alleged co-conspirator was a member of a conspiracy before statements in furtherance thereof 
are admissible, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government -- and viewing only the government's 
evidence, the court finds sufficient evidence to infer the alleged membership in the conspiracy which warrants the allowance of 
these documents into evidence.  Greater Buffalo strenuously objects to the admission into evidence of both the memoranda of 
Nicht to his superiors and his memoranda for his personal files.  Since these memoranda in the main concern events testified to 
by Koessler or verified as to substantial accuracy by Koessler, or in some instances concern subjects about which Greater 
Buffalo has offered similar exhibits (P-77-P-88) (Tr. pp. 1008-1010), the court admits those documents into evidence as being of 
some probative value concerning the state of mind of Nicht at the time the events took place.  Cf.  United States v. Corn "

501,4," This is not to conclude that the tie-in practice is not engaged in by certain syndicates controlling the licensing of color comics. 
The testimony at the trial of Mr. Koessler and others indicates that King Features had for a long period of time engaged in tie-in 
practices, and that such tie-ins seriously affected competition between Greater Buffalo and King.  In fairness, it should be 
pointed out that King Features was not represented by counsel during these proceedings, did not cross-examine any witnesses 
regarding King's alleged tie-in practices, did not present evidence on its own behalf, or in any way take part in the trial, having 
previously agreed to a consent decree entered on the 31st day of August, 1965.  The terms of that decree provided in part: 
""V(B).  Notwithstanding the making and entry of this final judgment, the plaintiff may, if the court adjudicates that the defendant, 
Greater Buffalo, has violated any of the antitrust laws as charged in the complaint filed herein, seek, and the court may order, 
such other relief as to the consenting defendant as the court may deem necessary and appropriate to dissipate the effects of the 
unlawful activities that may be found by the court, and to permit and restore competition in interstate trade and commerce in the 
printing and sale of color comic supplements . . ."" Since the court, as outlined in this memorandum, has not found the defendant 
Greater Buffalo violated any of the antitrust laws as charged, the court has no power under the terms of the judgment entered 
August 31, 1965, to enjoin the defendant Hearst from engaging in any tie-in practice which may be revealed by the evidence. "

530,4," These and numerous other cases referred to in the Court's opinion in United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, hold that 
repeal of antitrust laws in regulated industries is to be implied only where necessary to permit the agency to fulfill its statutory 
function.  Repeal has been found in only a few cases where the regulatory body has been granted specific broad and detailed 
authority over rates, service offerings and market areas and where it has been granted express antitrust exemptions for agency 
approved transactions.  Even under these circumstances the exemptions have been limited.  See, for examples of the 
exemptions and their limits, Georgia v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 324 U.S. 439, 89 L. Ed. 1051, 65 S. Ct. 716 (1945), and 49

539,1," The court was motivated in part in its determination to bifurcate the issues for trial by the fact that the jury trial was held less 
than two months after the filing of the creditors' petition and the antitrust claim was represented to require extensive discovery 
and many days of trial time.  Had the jury found in the trial that was held on September 9, 1970 that the alleged bankrupt was 
solvent and thus that no act of bankruptcy had in fact been committed, the antitrust question would have become immaterial."
539,2," Reference is made to this court's prior order of August 26, 1970 for a more detailed statement of the facts of this case.  At the 
opening of the trial on September 9, 1970 counsel for the petitioning creditors moved to amend his petition to allege the 
commission of the third act of bankruptcy as defined in 11 U.S.C. § 21, namely that Otto's Liquor, Inc.: ""* * * (3) suffered or permitted, while insolvent, any creditor to obtain a lien upon any of his property through legal 
proceedings or distraint and not having vacated or discharged such lien within thirty days from the date thereof of or at least 
five days before the date set for any sale or other disposition of such property * * *"" It was undisputed in the evidence that the State of Minnesota acquired a judgment against Otto's Liquor, Inc. in the amount of 
$2,700.08 on July 20, 1970 for unpaid sales taxes which was not satisfied, vacated or discharged within 30 days thereafter.  July 
20, 1970 was six days after the original filing of the involuntary petition on July 14, 1970.  Though counsel for the alleged 
bankrupt at first objected, ultimately it was stipulated that the amendment could be granted and that the date for determining 
insolvency would be either or both July 20, 1970 or July 14, 1970, the date of the filing of the petition.  Since only six days' time 
elapsed between these dates and since the business of the alleged bankrupt had not operated after June 27, 1970, it seemed 
clear that no material financial change took place during those six days.  The court appreciated the willingness of counsel so to 
stipulate and thus avoid the useless procedure of dismissing the present petition only to have another filed shortly setting up the 
claimed third act of bankruptcy. "

549,6," The Commission determined that trading stamps are ""a viable means of competition at the retail level"" and ""have become an 
integral and important part of retailing in America"".  This accorded with the finding of the examiner that ""in the issuance of its 
complaint, the Commission took pains not to attack the trading stamp business as such"". Upon the basis of exhaustive analysis of the evidence of record and personal observation of the demeanor of the witnesses, the 
Examiner concluded that serious damage would be visited upon S & H through commercial trafficking in S & H stamps and that 
the action of S & H alone in stopping that activity was inherently essential to the conduct of the trading stamp business."
549,7, The Federal Trade Commission Act and the Clayton Act. 
550,1," In 1964 S & H issued 140 billion stamps for which licensed retailers paid $322,296,000.  The retailers gave S & H trading 
stamps in connection with sales of ten to fifteen billion dollars worth of goods and services.  About 60 percent of all households 
in the nation save S & H ""green"" stamps. In 1964 trading stamps of all companies were issued in connection with annual sales to the consuming public of about 
$40,000,000,000."
550,2," The Commission found: In a number of metropolitan areas stamp dispensing by supermarkets accounts for a major proportion of the retail food 
business.  Twelve supermarket chains accounted for a third of respondent's revenue of 1965, all of which became 
customers since the 1950s.  The following are some of the markets in which stamp dispensing supermarkets account for 
over 70 percent of retail food volume: Dallas, Fort Worth, 97 percent; Miami, 79 percent; Albany, 78 percent; Jacksonville, 
77 percent; Salt Lake City, 86 percent; Little Rock, 79 percent; El Paso, 72 percent."
550,3," Trading stamp companies contend that the cost of stamps are absorbed by the licensed retailers who do not raise prices but 
hope to profit from an increased volume of sales.  In 1966 the average price paid by retailers for stamps was $2.23 for 1,000, or 
1 cent for about 5 stamps. S & H charges a comparable amount, $2.70 for a book of 1,200.  This is 2 1/4 percent of the sales on 
which stamps are given. On the other hand: ""A substantial number of retailers admit that they cannot offset the costs of stamps at all except by passing 
the cost on to the consumer in the form of higher prices. ""Should the retailer wish to abandon the stamp plan rather than raise his prices, he is faced with some difficulty, for once his 
customers have begun to save stamps they will not want to stop before they have acquired enough stamps for redemption. This 
makes it virtually impossible for the retailer to stop giving stamps without losing business.  Therefore, when the retailer's market 
area reaches the point of trading stamp saturation, continued membership in the stamp plan does no more than allow the retailer 
to meet competition.  If he withdraws from the stamp plan, he will stand to lose business.  If he continues to give stamps, he will 
have to raise prices and thereby antagonize his customers. All the retailers in the area, being faced with the same choice, will 
probably raise prices.  In 1958, when only seven out of ten leading supermarket chains were giving stamps, a study by the 
Department of Agriculture showed that prices in stores which gave stamps were at least six-tenths of one per cent higher than in 
stores which did not give them.  Today, with trading stamp saturation in many areas, it is probable that this figure has become 
more substantial. ""The Consumer. -- The housewife cannot decline to save stamps; she is virtually forced to do so.  If she does not, the buyer who 
shops at the same store and does save stamps will be paying lower prices for the same purchases.  Thus, in order to take 
advantage of the lowest possible prices, the housewife must submit to the collecting of trading stamps. Moreover, she must 
choose stores by the kind of stamps they give, for few people will find it profitable to save more than two types of stamps. "
551,," ""Even if a consumer decides to collect stamps and pay the resulting higher prices, she may not be getting the promised value 
upon redemption. Stamps are redeemed in some states in either cash or merchandise at the option of the holder.  Under these 
circumstances, the cash redemption value is always much lower than merchandise redemption value. . . ."" Comment, Trading

551,4," From 1914 through 1964, S & H issued 1120 billion stamps. At the end of 1964 156 billion stamps, worth many millions of 
dollars, were still outstanding.  The Commission found that the record did not permit a determination with certainty of the 
percentage of stamps never presented for redemption by the public, but concluded that it was probable that redemptions would 
fall ""somewhere between 86 and 95 percent of total stamps issued"". "

553,9," The Commission observed that such retailers were not attempting to obtain S & H's ""Green"" stamps for reissue, but only to 
attract customers. They were ""vying for the patronage of consumers who collected S & H and other trading stamps"".  The 
Commission concluded that where a retailer was faced with stamp competition an effective countermeasure might be to offer to 
exchange or redeem stamps, and that S & H had prevented this type of competitive reaction."
553,10," The Commission found that S & H had prosecuted a substantial number of suits during the 1957-65 period, and had issued 
315 warning letters, all for the purpose of suppressing what S & H regarded as ""unauthorized"" redemption of its stamps. In 
virtually all cases, the Commission pointed out, the ""firms (many of which were retailers) were forced to abandon their 
redemption or exchange practices"".  The Commission found that the dominance of S & H in the trading stamp field, and the 
popularity of the S & H ""Green"" stamp, gave S & H virtual monopoly power over the existence of the small trading stamp 
exchanges which were unable to operate effectively without S & H stamps. With respect to trading stamp exchanges, the 
Commission determined that the effect of S & H's activities . . . tended to eliminate the operations of a whole class of businessmen who provided, or had been providing, a useful and 
valuable function."

553,12," Many brands of stamps are dispensed mainly in one region, e. g., Blue Chip stamps in California, Frontier stamps in Texas, 
Stop & Save in the East.  The trading stamp exchange enables consumers to trade stamps collected in one location, and not 
found in the area to which they have moved, for those dispensed and redeemed in the new area. "

557,4," As to appellant's first point, it should be observed that he cited nothing in his brief that would suggest that this is a controversy 
over wages, hours or conditions of employment or any other issue within the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor 
Relations Board.  The union's view is that this is not a collective bargaining dispute, but simply a matter of enforcing a contract 
between a union and one of its members. In arguing his second point before this court, appellant contended that the following provision of the contract violated the ""Right 
to Work Law"": ""It is further agreed that all those working at the trade and eligible to membership according to the Constitution of 
the National Union shall be members in good standing in the Local Union and that every Journeyman Barber (e.g. appellant 
Bales) must present a working card to the Proprietor (e.g. appellant Bales) issued by the Union before he is engaged to work, 
except that the Proprietor shall have the right to hire non-Union Barbers if the Local Union is unable to supply Union help when 
called upon, provided, however, that any non-Union Barber so employed shall within thirty (30) days make application for 
membership and be issued a working permit by the Secretary of the Local Union, pending final approval, unless a Union Barber 
cannot be supplied during the employment of the non-Union Barber."""
557,5," It is not necessary for us to consider whether these issues, raised only at the appellate level, disclose fundamental error, 
because a decision can be reached on other grounds. "

571,1," In this action, unlike the situation which existed in Ramsey v. United Mine Workers of America, 416 F.2d 655 (6th Cir. 1969), a 
coal company which allegedly conspired with the Union to restrain trade was made a codefendant. "
572,2," A notable difference is that, unlike in the cases cited above, there is in the present case no contention made that the alleged 
conspiracy attempted to affect or manipulate coal prices in the T.V.A. bituminous coal market."
572,3," The Lewis v. Pennington case has a rather involved history.  This Court first affirmed the District Court holding against UMW in 
Pennington v. UMW, 325 F.2d 804 (6th Cir. 1963). The Supreme Court agreed that the Union's exemption from the antitrust laws 
did not apply in this situation but reversed on other grounds.  UMW v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 
1585 (1965). On retrial in Lewis v. Pennington, 257 F. Supp. 815 (1966), the District Court found in favor of the Union reasoning 
that plaintiff failed to demonstrate by ""clear proof"" any violation of the antitrust laws. This Court in Lewis v. Pennington, 400 F.2d 
806 (6th Cir. 1968) affirmed the District Court.  (Before Judges Edwards, Peck and Combs, per J. Edwards).  Certiorari was 
denied by the Supreme Court in 393 U.S. 983, 89 S. Ct. 450, 21 L. Ed. 2d 444 (1968)."
572,4," In Ramsey v. UMW this Court sat en banc.  This was an appeal from the District Court ruling dismissing the action, 265 F. 
Supp. 388 (1967), because plaintiffs could not show an antitrust violation on the part of the Union by ""clear proof"", although by 
the ordinary standard of preponderance of the evidence the Court suggested that liability might be imposed upon the Union.  A 
three-judge panel of this Court heard this appeal on April 8, 1969.  Rehearing en banc was granted and that opinion appears at 
416 F.2d 655 (6th Cir. 1969), Chief Judge Phillips and Judges Edwards, Peck and Combs for affirming; opinion by Judge 
Edwards.  Judges Weick, O'Sullivan, Celebrezze and McCree for reversing; opinion by Judge O'Sullivan.  Certiorari was granted 
by the Supreme Court, 397 U.S. 1006, 90 S. Ct. 1238, 25 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1970). One week before the en banc hearing in Ramsey, a panel composed of Judges Weick, Peck and Combs (opinion by Judge 
Weick) in Tennessee Consolidated Coal Company v. UMW, 416 F.2d 1192 (1969) affirmed the jury finding of liability of the 
union for an antitrust violation. (The West Kentucky Coal Company which was joined as a defendant because it was an alleged 
coconspirator of the union was voluntarily non-suited.  Thus, here again we had only the union being sued.) This Court observed 
regarding the District Court's instructions that the Union was given the benefit of a more stringent standard of proof by the 
fashion in which the District Court instructed the jury on ""clear proof"" and, therefore, was not prejudiced by the instructions even 
if they were incorrect.  The Court made the following remark respecting Section 6 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act: ""Section 6 does 
provide that participation, authorization or ratification must be shown by clear proof. Section 6 does not state that the unlawful 
acts must be shown by clear proof."" Judges Peck and Combs were among the judges in the divided court in Ramsey, supra, 
which there held that all elements of the antitrust violation except damages must be shown by clear proof. Judge Weick, author "
573,," of the opinion in Tennessee Consolidated Coal, joined those judges in Ramsey who felt that only the authorization, participation 
or ratification by the Union of the unlawful acts need be shown by clear proof. Certiorari in Tennessee Consolidated Coal was 
denied by the Supreme Court, 397 U.S. 964, 90 S. Ct. 999, 25 L. Ed. 2d 256, 38 U.S.L.W. 3335, 3342 (1970)."
573,5," The District Court gave an instruction on proof by a preponderance of the evidence, see infra p. 778.  However, in its 
supplemental instructions to the jury, the Court gave the following charge on ""clear proof"": ""Members of the jury, the Court has already charged you that the issue of alleged conspiracy in this case must be decided 
upon clear proof, that is, the plaintiff must produce clear proof of the alleged conspiracy. Clear proof means clear, 
unequivocal, and convincing proof that the defendants participated in, actually authorized the alleged conspiracy or ratified 
it after having actual knowledge thereof.  I want to give you that additional instruction as a definition for one of the terms I 
used in my charge."" Thus, the District Court did charge the jury that ""clear proof"" of participation, authorization or ratification of the alleged conspiracy 
by the defendants was necessary to hold them liable.  While it is concluded that the ""clear proof"" standard is applicable only in 
holding a union ratified or authorized the acts of its officials, the District Court's instruction even if erroneous gave both 
defendants the benefit of a more stringent burden of proof for finding them liable."
573,6," HN1[
] Section 6 of the Act (29 U.S.C. § 106) provides: ""No officer or member of any association or organization, and no association or organization participating or interested in a 
labor dispute, shall be held responsible or liable in any court of the United States for the unlawful acts of individual officers, 
members, or agents, except upon clear proof of actual participation in, or actual authorization of, such acts, or of ratification 
of such acts after actual knowledge thereof."" "
574,7," See n. 5, supra. "
575,8," The Union proffered the following instruction: ""3.  In Section 6 of the Clayton Act, which amended the Sherman Antitrust Act, Congress declared 'that the labor of a 
human being is not a commodity or article of commerce nor shall (labor) organizations or the members thereof be held or 
construed to be illegal combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade under the antitrust laws.' The entering into a wage 
agreement with employers, which is a successful union activity, may have some influence on price competition by 
eliminating that part of such competition which is based on differences in labor standards.  However, a labor union to be 
effective must eliminate the competition from goods produced under sub-standard labor conditions.  The elimination of price 
competition based on differences in labor standards is a lawful union objective and the effect of such objective on price 
competition is not violative of the antitrust laws. Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 503, 84 L. Ed. 1311, 60 S. Ct. 
982; UMWA v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 664, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585."" "
576,9," The correct statement per Pennington is ""a certain wage scale on other bargaining units."" Apparently, this was a misspoken 
phrase, as the District Judge in the remainder of the charge more than adequately conveys the idea that the disallowed conduct 
is when an employer (or a multi-employer bargaining unit) combines with a labor union to impose certain labor standards or 
conditions on other bargaining units or employers. "
577,10," The Ramsey case relied upon by appellants was a non-jury case.  On appeal an observation -- not an instruction -- made by 
the District Judge in his opinion was quoted with approval.  Since the ""equal inference"" rule or doctrine is used by the trial judge 
in deciding the question of whether a directed verdict should be granted a defendant because plaintiff has not satisfied his 
burden of proof, it is both logical and correct that this rule entered the trial judge's thinking in the non-jury trial in Ramsey.  It is 
doubtful that the equal inference instruction given in Tennessee Consolidated to the jury was correct.  However, this apparently 
was not assigned as error on appeal as no mention whatsoever is made of that instruction or the propriety of its use in the 
appellate opinion in the case.  See Tennessee Consolidated Coal Company v. United Mine Workers, 416 F.2d 1192 (6th Cir. 
1969). "

the findings of the jury in Tennessee Coal.  Certiorari was denied in Tennessee Coal but granted in Ramsey. "
581,14," During closing arguments counsel for UMW objected to certain statements made by counsel for South-East about the National 
Agreement.  The District Court at that time gave further instructions to the jury about the PWC.  The colloquy was as follows: The Court: ""As I understand counsel's argument, he is drawing a deduction from these circumstances.  He does not argue, 
and the jury is instructed, if it has been given that impression, that it is not proper. ""There is nothing wrong per se, that is, of itself, with the execution of this contract.  I should instruct them on that as a 
general instruction. ""In other words, you are not to consider that simply because there was an agreement between BCOA and the UMW that 
that of itself established a violation of the antitrust laws. ""I got the impression that he was using those figures to establish his claim that the results proved the basis on which he 
relied."" South-East's Counsel: ""The circumstances at the time of making these contracts, they have got to be used to prove an 
antitrust claim."" "
582,," Appellants' Counsel: ""I submit to the Court that the same words that were used at the bench as being objectionable were 
used by this counsel to the same effect, that this jury would have to consider the consequences of this type of bargaining, 
eliminating from the whole industry certain people and causing a good deal of harm."" The Court: ""The jury is instructed that the execution of the contract itself is not per se a violation of law."" Appellants' Counsel: ""Okay."""
582,15," Appellants also claim error in the instruction because of remarks made by the District Judge which were incorrect statements 
of certain dates involving passage of the PWC and ""80-cent clause."" In the supplemental instruction the District Judge corrected 
himself and no prejudice resulted from the error. "
586,16," The Court made the following examination of Mr. LaViers in ascertaining what took place in the coffee shop: (Reporter's note:) ""The following occurred at the bench in the immediate presence of counsel and the Court, and in the absence 
and out of the hearing of the jury: ""The Court: I want to clarify this other situation before we get into anything else.  This is out of the presence or hearing of the 
jurors, at the bench, in connection with the statement made to the Court by Mr. Schmidt, counsel for the defendant Consolidation 
Coal Company with reference to two of the jurors, Mr. Hill and Mr. Osborne, who were seen in conversation with Mr. Harry 
LaViers, Sr., at the Coffee Shop of the Phoenix Hotel about 7:30 to 8:00 o'clock this morning, October 11, 1968. ""Now, then, do you want to make any further statement?  I am just asking."" "
587,," Off the record. (Reporter's note:) ""An off-the-record discussion took place at the bench. ""The Court: Come here, Mr. LaViers, please.  Mr. LaViers, it has been reported to the Court that this morning in the Coffee Shop 
at the Phoenix Hotel, you, in the presence of Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Rowntree -- ""Mr. Schmidt: Mr. Rowntree was not present. ""The Court: No. ""Mr. Rowntree: As I stated, I was there earlier. ""The Court: Yes. I don't know who else was there.  But you were seated near or standing near or in the company -- not 'in the 
company,' I don't want to use that term -- but in contact with Mr. Hill and Mr. Osborne, who are members of the jury.  Now, do 
you recall that incident? ""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: Yes, I do, Your Honor. ""The Court: Would you mind stating just what it was? ""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: Yes, Mr. Rowntree had gone down to breakfast prior to my coming down.  When I came into the Coffee Shop, I 
looked for him and found that the table where he was seated only had one chair and I was looking around for some other table 
to sit at, and the head waitress came and said, 'Well, just sit down here' -- which was right across the aisle from Mr. Rowntree -- 
and I sat down on the bench and ordered my breakfast. And Mr. Hill was sitting next to me, and he asked me, he said, 'Do you know Mr. Oscar Evans who lives in Paintsville?' And I said, 'Well, he doesn't live in Paintsville now; he has gone to Florida -- but I do know Mr. Evans.' And he said, 'Well, I used to board at his house.' And he said he was quite a character. And I said, 'Yes, I agree with that,' and, 'I knew him very well.' And then I believe that part of the breakfast, not the main part, was served, and Mr. Hill then asked me if I knew Mr. Nelson 
Howard who lived in Paintsville; and I said yes, 'I know Mr. Nelson Howard; he came from Gallatin County; he was in the 
automobile business there and later was in the coal business, I know him.' Mr. Hill said he used to work for him.  I said, 'Well, he 
was quite an aggressive merchant when he was there, he made a lot of money and decided he would go into the farming 
business and bought a couple of farms down in Bourbon County, and I understand, lost what he had of his investment in these 
farms.' I guess the rest of the breakfast was served about that time.  I don't recall that there was -- there was some gentleman came in 
on the other side, and they turned to him to speak to him.  I don't recall any further conversation. There was nothing about this lawsuit. ""The Court: Do you want to ask him a question? ""Mr. Schmidt: Mr. LaViers, there were other places to sit down in the Coffee Shop besides next to Mr. Hill and Mr. Osborne when 
you sat down?  Isn't that true? ""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: Well, yes, sir, there are other tables for four and tables for two and the tables at the bench are for two, and the 
head waitress came along and tossed a menu down and just said, 'Sit down here,' and I sat where she put the menu.  I didn't 
seek out this seat. ""Mr. Schmidt: You saw them sitting there? ""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: Oh, yes, I saw them sitting there. ""Mr. Schmidt: Was it in your mind that, even so, it wouldn't hurt to develop some sort of a social rapport with these gentlemen? ""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: No, Mr. Schmidt, that was not in my mind.  I am by nature a person who talks to people in the elevator or 
wherever it might be, and I would be untruthful and unrealistic if I didn't say I do engage in conversations. ""The Court: How many minutes would you assume, or how much time, I should say, would you assume your conversation or 
what you stated to the Court, or anything in addition to that, was consumed with either of these men? "
588,," ""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: Oh, there were snatches of conversation, I imagine about ten or fifteen minutes.  I was eating breakfast. ""The Court: That covered the whole period? ""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: Well, not the whole period of breakfast, but the period of the conversation. ""The Court: Do you want to ask him anything further? ""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: Mr. Rowntree has continuously cautioned me about this. ""The Court: Well, you see the point is, I mean, the Court accepts your statement that you didn't say anything about the case. ""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: We didn't talk anything about the case, Your Honor. ""The Court: But, you see, the difficulty is that this more or less currying of favor with a juror -- while I realize it isn't currying a 
favor deliberately -- but it has brought questions to people's minds.  I realize some people are just naturally friendly, and 
Kentuckians are just that way -- I know them pretty well -- but we mustn't do anything like this. ""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: I would be very, very happy to avoid them. ""The Court: The Court is confident that you didn't do anything intentionally.  That is the ruling of the Court. Now, do you have anything you want to ask him? ""Mr. Rowntree: No. ""Mr. Schmidt: May I ask him a question? ""The Court: Yes, sir. ""Mr. Schmidt: Mr. LaViers, you have seen each of those gentlemen sit at the same table every morning? ""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: No, sir, they have not, as far as my knowledge, sat at that same table.  They do sit in the Coffee Shop there at 
various places, but I don't recall seeing them at that particular place, Your Honor."" "
590,17," Computation of injuries by the first method produced a damages figure of $3,082,816.  The damages figure produced by the 
second method was $2,896,713.  The jury awarded damages of $2,410,452 or approximately $700,000 less than the damages 
computed by the first method and $500,000 less than computed by the second method."
590,18," Figures reflecting operating profit and losses rather than net income were used because these figures do not include such 
things as percentage depletion allowances which are treated as return of capital, interest payments (expenses) or income, 
capital gains and losses and dividend income. "
593,1," By the terms of the Plan, an employee's undivided share of the Plan is subject to redistribution until specified conditions of 
termination of employment are satisfied.  Plaintiff does not allege that he has met any of these conditions.  Thus, Plaintiff's 
interest in the Plan has not vested."
593,2," In Austin v. House of Vision, Inc., supra, 404 F.2d at p. 403, the court said, ""We find no showing of injury to the public or to the plaintiff.  Plaintiff has been fully able to compete as evidenced by his 
freedom of choice in immediately obtaining similar employment with a competitor in the same neighborhood.  There is no 
complaint by a business competitor that it was unable to hire optical employees as a result of any practice engaged in by 
defendant."" "
594,," Indeed, were Plaintiff's contentions to be adopted, one could conceivably argue that payment of a high salary constitutes an 
unlawful restraint on trade if it tends to prevent an employee from quitting to seek other employment. "

and documentary material; "

plaintiff that it cannot prove such claim and abandons such claim."" Industrial Bldg. Materials, Inc. v. Interchemical Corp., 278 F. Supp. 938, 947-48 (C.D. Cal. 1967). "
601,2," The Supreme Court's criticism of a trial court's adoption, ""mechanically,"" of findings proposed by the prevailing party is, a 
fortiori, applicable to an expository legal opinion submitted by the successful litigant and adopted by the trial court in support of 
its judgment."
601,3," This may, of course, have reflected the true attitude of appellee's attorneys, who authored the comments.  We do not criticize 
these attorneys, recognizing that they were placed in a position of inherent conflict.  They were requested to submit an opinion 
and findings and conclusions which, if adopted by the court, would reflect impartiality and restrained, objective judicial attitude.  
On the other hand, their duty, as advocates, was to present all their contentions in the light most favorable to their clients."

604,8," The notion that a dominant manufacturer may not undertake a program of eliminating distributors finds support in many 
reported District Court decisions.  For example, in dealing with a similar situation in Potter's Photographic Applications Co. v. 
Ealing Corp., 292 F. Supp. 92, 104 (E.D.N.Y. 1968), the court wrote: ""In the absence of any allegations of either (1) a horizontal conspiracy between competitors, (2) an effort by either 
defendant to establish market dominance or extend a natural monopoly of its own product, (3) an effort to drive out the 
products of competing film producers, or (4) other restrictive trade practices (such as price fixing), the agreement between 
Ealing and Popular Science to grant Popular Science an exclusive distributorship in the New York area and Ealing's 
decision to refuse to continue dealing with plaintiff do not violate the Sherman Act.""  The court then cited all those cases cited by the defendants in this case for the broad, unrestricted proposition that Presstite 
could conspire with others to eliminate Industrial as a distributor. For similar statements as to the true rule, see Arzee Supply 
Corp. v. Ruberoid Co., 222 F. Supp. 237, 241 (D. Conn. 1963); Alexander v. Texas Co., 149 F. Supp. 37, 42-43 (W.D. La. 1957);

610,1," We recognize that the securities industry is subject to extensive public regulation and that the commissions charged by 
brokerage houses to their customers are uniform.  See New York Stock Exchange Constitution, Article XV (""Commissions and 
Service Charges"") and New York Stock Exchange Rules of Board of Governors, Rules No. 365-383 (""Commissions""), which are 
imposed on stock exchange member firms pursuant to the self-regulatory authority found in § 6 of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934, 15 U.S.C. § 78f. Under § 19(b) of that Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78s(b), the Securities and Exchange Commission is 
empowered, after noncompliance with a request made of the exchange, notice, and an opportunity for the exchange to be heard, 
to alter and supplement the rules of the exchange ""in respect of such matters as . . . (9) the fixing of reasonable rates of 
commission, interest, listing, and other charges . . . ."" In the exercise of its authority under § 19, the SEC may have the power to fix the commissions paid to representatives as one 
component of the rate of commission charged to the public, which could result in exemption of such rate from antitrust attack.  
See Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U.S. 341, 360-61, 10 L. Ed. 2d 389, 83 S. Ct. 1246 (1963). In the present case, 
however, no argument has been made that the alleged practice of compensating representatives with a uniform share of the 
commissions exacted of the customer has been ordered or even sanctioned by the SEC or any provision of the securities laws. 
Since there is no evidence that the SEC has authorized or even condoned the alleged practices upon which this action is based, 
we need not consider the special problems which might arise under such circumstances.  United States v. Philadelphia National

625,13,"  ""We agree with the trial court that considerations of price, quality and service were not overlooked by either du Pont or 
General Motors.  Pride in its products and its high financial stake in General Motors' success would naturally lead du Pont 
to try to supply the best.  But the wisdom of this business judgment cannot obscure the fact, plainly revealed by the record, 
that du Pont purposely employed its stock to pry open the General Motors market to entrench itself as the primary supplier 
of General Motors' requirements for automotive finishes and fabrics. ""Similarly, the fact that all concerned in high executive posts in both companies acted honorably and fairly, each in the 
honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own company and without any design to overreach 
anyone, including du Pont's competitors, does not defeat the Government's right to relief.  It is not requisite to the proof of a 
violation of § 7 to show that restraint or monopoly was intended."" [353 U.S. 586, 606-607, 77 S. Ct. 872, 884 1 L. Ed. 2d

commercial relations between du Pont and General Motors there was no fraudulent or improper conduct on the part of the 
officers and directors of both companies, and no overreaching of any kind.  Here again, however, the Court concludes that 
these facts do not in any way mitigate or qualify the duty of this Court to frame a decree that will effectively remove and 
guard against the effects of the acquisition of the stock which have been held to be offensive to the statute."" 177 F. Supp. 1,

the transactions. ""The business relationships growing out of the sale of automotive fabrics and finishes by du Pont to General Motors were 
completely unrelated to the stock interest that du Pont held in General Motors.  These sales and purchases resulted from 
arm's length transactions under competitive conditions.  The prices paid by General Motors were market place prices.  The 
quality of the products and the service that was furnished with the products were equal to if not better than what was

654,8," Of course, plaintiffs allege that this quota was unjustifiably parsimonious due to defendants' filing of false nomination forecasts. "
655,9," Defendants spend a good deal of time arguing that as a matter of law there can be no finding of a refusal to deal by Lavaca.  
They first argue that since Lavaca is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alcoa, does not carry gas for anyone else, and does not 
compete with Alcoa, any refusal was merely a unilateral refusal.  Secondly, defendants argue that there was insufficient 
evidence to show that Woods tendered his gas to Lavaca.  Conversely, plaintiffs argue that Lavaca did carry gas for other 
companies in addition to Alcoa; moreover, plaintiffs contend that under Texas law Lavaca is both a common purchaser, Tex. 
Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6049a and a common carrier, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6050, and thus is under an obligation to 
carry plaintiffs' gas.  Finally, plaintiffs allege that the evidence as to Woods' offer, while disputed, has been resolved by the jury 
in favor of plaintiffs. We quickly dispose of the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence.  There was here sufficient evidence upon 
which the jury might have found both that Woods tendered his gas which was then refused by Lavaca and that Lavaca carried 
gas for others.  Likewise, we find without merit defendants' argument that the refusal to transport gas was merely a lawful 
unilateral refusal by Lavaca.  Defendants first fail to realize that while section 1 or section 2 conspiracies evidenced by refusals 
to deal do require a combination or conspiracy between two or more entities, section 2 monopolization or attempted 
monopolization does not.  Therefore, even if the refusal is viewed as the act of Alcoa, it would furnish a basis for finding 
monopolization or attempted monopolization if it constitutes either a ""willful maintenance"" of monopoly power or a specific intent 
to obtain monopoly power. See National Screen Service Corp. v. Poster Exchange, Inc., supra, 305 F.2d at 651-52; Fiumara v. 
Texaco, Inc., E.D. Pa., 204 F. Supp. 544, 552, aff'd, 3 Cir. 1962, 310 F.2d 737. However, we think that in any event the alleged 
action by Lavaca could not be characterized as a unilateral refusal to deal.  Judge Thornberry has stated the rule with regard to 
section 1, and we feel it is equally applicable to conspiracies under section 2:HN24[

711,1," It is true that in its motion for leave to file its counterclaim, Zenith stated that the counterclaim arose out of conduct of HRI 
""occurring since the filing of the answer"" in 1960.  On the basis of this statement, HRI argues that Zenith precluded itself from 
recovering damages resulting from pre-answer conduct.  This argument is not persuasive.  The counterclaim itself was not so 
limited, and Zenith made its position on damages absolutely clear by the opening of trial.  HRI was thereby given both ample 
notice of the substance of Zenith's claim and ample opportunity to respond, but made no effort during trial to do so. "
712,2," Zenith similarly limited its claim for damages in the English and Australian markets to the years 1959-1963 and similarly sought 
to recover all damages suffered in those years without regard to the date of the conduct causing the damages.  HRI again did 
not plead or argue that Zenith was not entitled to its full damages during those years in the two markets, until it moved after trial 
to set aside the judge's findings and to reopen the proof so that it could show that Zenith's exclusion from the markets prior to 
1959 was a consequence of governmental restrictions and technical difficulties rather than of pool conduct."
712,3," The District Court gave HRI five days to file its amendments to the pleadings ""nunc pro tunc as of"" the date of the argument on 
HRI's motion.  As a result, the defenses were technically filed prior to the entry of judgment and the taking of appeal, while the 
District Court still retained jurisdiction over the suit. "
713,4," At the time HRI raised its defenses, the release on which it relied was not part of the record, although the record did contain a 
contract between the parties to the release in which they agreed to exchange releases, and frequent reference had been made 
during trial to the settlement of which the exchange of releases was a part.  The record also belied HRI's claim that the 
conspiracy had been dormant during 1959-1963, for it contained a letter written in 1962 from the pool to a distributor of Motorola 
products in Canada threatening infringement suits if he continued to distribute American-made products of Motorola. "
714,5," On November 1, 1962, a consent decree was entered against the last defendant named in the Government action, which had 
been commenced on November 24, 1958, thereby terminating that action as to all parties.  See  Barnett v. Warner Bros. 
Pictures Dist. Corp., 112 F.Supp. 5, 7 (ND Ill. 1953). For purposes of the present suit against HRI, which was not a party to the 
Government action, the running of the statute of limitations was thus tolled until November 1, 1963 -- one year after the entry of 
the consent decree.  See 15 U. S. C. § 16 (b)."
714,6," The Government suit was United States v. General Electric Co., Civil Action No. 140-157, which was brought in the Southern 
District of New York.  The complaint and the final judgment were introduced in evidence in the present proceedings as Plaintiff's 
Exhibits Nos. 44-47. "
715,7," HRI does suggest that the 1955 amendment of § 16, see 69 Stat. 283, must be understood as an indication of Congress' 
approval of earlier cases in the lower federal courts confining the operation of § 16 (b) to parties defendant in Government suits.  
See text infra, this page and 337.  We are unpersuaded.  HRI can point to no direct evidence that Congress ever considered the 
issue now before us or voiced any views upon it; on the contrary, it appears that Congress left the matter for authoritative 
resolution in the courts.  The true thrust of HRI's argument is that we must find congressional approval of the earlier cases in 
Congress' silence when it re-enacted the statute.  We did not take such an approach, however, in Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co. 
v.  New Jersey Wood Finishing Co., 381 U.S. 311 (1965), and  Leh v. General Petroleum Corp., 382 U.S. 54 (1965), and we do 
not do so here. "
717,8," If the trial judge had passed upon the question, he well might have concluded that none of the damages sustained by Zenith in 
the Canadian market between 1959 and 1963 was a consequence of pre-1954 conspiratorial conduct.  The trial judge in effect 
found that, as to England and Australia, the effects of conspiratorial conduct were no longer felt by Zenith more than four years 
after the conduct had occurred, and there is no reason to infer that his findings would have been different in regard to Canada 
either in the present suit or in a suit brought in 1954.  But the trial judge made no such findings as to Canada, and we lack power 
to make them for him."
717,9," Of course, these percentages are purely hypothetical.  They rest upon an assumption that, if Zenith had sued in 1954 for future 
damages in the Canadian market and had claimed that it would take 10 years for it to attain its full share of that market under 
free competitive conditions, then it would have proved that in 1955 it would have reached 10% of that share, in 1956, 20%, and 
so on.  In each year it would have recovered damages for that percentage of the share which it had not yet attained. "

719,11," The Model Joint Obligations Act, 9B U. L. A. 355, which has been adopted in regard to tort claims by four States, is most 
similar to the rule stated in the text.  It provides that a release of an obligor shall release co-obligors to the full extent of the 
obligor's original liability, § 5 (a), unless the amount of that liability is not known to the obligee, § 5 (b), or the obligee expressly 
reserves his rights against the co-obligors.  § 4.  The four States adopting the act are Nevada, Nev. Rev. Stat., c. 101 (1967); 
New York, N. Y. General Obligations Law §§ 15-101 to 15-109 (1964); Utah, Utah Code Ann. §§ 15-4-1 to 15-4-7 (1953); 
Wisconsin, Wis. Stat. §§ 113.01 to 113.10 (1967). The Uniform Contribution among Tortfeasors Act, 9 U. L. A. 233, reverses the presumption arising from the absence of an 
express provision in the release.  It enacts that ""[a] release by the injured person of one joint tortfeasor . . . does not discharge 
the other tortfeasors unless the release so provides . . . ."" § 4.  The eight States that have adopted the Uniform Act are

720,12," Resort may be had to the contract in construing the release since the parole evidence rule is usually understood to be 
operative only as to parties to a document, and HRI here was not a party to the release.  See  Stern v. Commissioner, 137 F.2d

Rauland each to grant RCA, GE and Western Electric, respectively, a general release, each such release, to the extent either 
party may request, to bind or benefit the parent and subsidiaries of the party giving or receiving such release ('subsidiaries' to 
include corporations in which the party has stock ownership of 50% or more)."" "
721,1," For example: ""Mr. Kayser [Hazeltine's counsel]: . . . it was not until during the trial, after we had the long Dodds affidavit and all 
of this testimony that suddenly, gradually this new theory starts to creep in, this new theory where we go back and try to recover 
again based on these allegedly wrongful acts many, many years ago. ""The Court: I must assume, to go along with that, that counsel at that time didn't read the pretrial brief which clearly set out, prior 
to the trial, this theory that you were taken by surprise by during the course of the trial."" App. 158.  See also App. 87, 144."
721,2," For example: ""The Court: . . . [Reads from Hazeltine's post-trial brief.] ""Do you differ with counsel's statement, your prior counsel's statement 90 days after proofs were closed? ""Mr. Kayser: As to what the issues were that were presented in this case, yes, your Honor, I do.  I most definitely do. ""The Court: Of course, you know by now that this is a new theory on your behalf. ""Mr. Kayser: Your Honor, I don't think it is a new theory.  I think that -- ""The Court: I mean, at least it wasn't advanced in this brief filed June 8, 90 days after the proofs closed. ""Mr. Kayser: Your Honor, we fully recognize the fact that the trial counsel did not realize what was happening to him.  We fully 
realize that fact.  If we had realized it -- ""The Court: I mean, he didn't even realize it 90 days after the proofs were over. "
722,," ""Mr. Kayser: Yes, your Honor.  I quite agree."" App. 72. Later the following colloquy occurred: ""The Court: Do you agree with the theory that sometime litigation must end? ""Mr. Kayser: Yes, your Honor. ""The Court: And these offers of proof [with respect to embargoes by the English and Australian Governments] are now being 
made more than one year after the proof closed on this case? ""Mr. Kayser: Your Honor, this I think is one of the most unusual cases that will come into a Courtroom, in that we have here, as I 
think we can demonstrate -- without basis we have here the danger of a judgment of almost forty-nine million dollars which will 
spell corporate death, which is subject to the affirmative defenses of limitations and of releases. . . . ""The Court: I just got through instructing a jury that in deliberating on their verdict, they should not take into consideration either 
sympathy or prejudice. . . . . ""Mr. Kayser: I submit most respectfully to this court that this court should take into account equity.  This is not a matter of 
sympathy.  This is a matter of equity and a matter of justice; that this judgment, which will spell the death of this corporation, has 
had absolutely no basis whatsoever.  It is subject to affirmative defenses.  It was accomplished by a subtle switch in theory.  
Maybe it should have been caught; maybe it shouldn't.  But is your Honor going to penalize this corporation -- ""The Court: I mean, it wasn't even caught 90 days after the proofs closed. ""Mr. Kayser: I agree, that's true.  I agree.  This is a very unusual case; we recognize that. ""The Court: You may proceed."" App. 108-109.  See also App. 71-76 passim, 158-161."
722,3," For example: ""The Court: . . . underlying what you are saying [with respect to the embargoes] is what is said so frequently in 
appeals in criminal cases, that they are where they are by virtue of incompetence of counsel. ""Now, there a person's liberty is involved, and what do the courts say in regard to this plea of incompetency of counsel? ""They say, first, was he counsel of your choice rather than appointed counsel?  And if he was, the courts say, in regard to 
keeping men incarcerated and depriving them of their liberty, that unless the trial conducted by counsel of the prisoner's choice 
was such a farce, such a fraud that justice would be horrified by the result, that since you are represented by counsel of your 
choice, why, agreed that he might not be the greatest in the world, but he was your lawyer and you picked him out.  You are 
going to have to remain incarcerated for the balance of your term. ""Now, how do we get around that analogy in this case?"" App. 140-141. Hazeltine's attorney responded in terms of his theory of surprise, whereupon the District Judge answered that federal procedure 
was based on notice pleading and in his opinion Hazeltine had been put on notice.  App. 141-144. See also, e. g., App. 116, 121-123, 146, 155."

counsel on his reply. App. 186, 189, 193. "
723,5," The opinion of the Court of Appeals gives no indication that its attention was drawn to the remarks of the District Judge during 
Hazeltine's argument in chief, which cast light on his ruling on the motion for leave to file. Its entire discussion of the basis for the 
District Court's action reads as follows: ""Zenith's counsel objected to the filing of the defenses on the ground that they came too late and were waived. The district court, 
however, permitted the defenses to be filed and thereafter denied HRI's motion for judgment based on the defenses. . . .  [The 
Supreme Court left open the question whether this ruling was on the merits.] It is our view that the court's ruling was not on the 
basis of waiver, but because the defenses on their merits did not bar Zenith's recovery.""  418 F.2d, at 23-24. "

conspired with each other to do, and pursuant to said combination and conspiracy did, among others, the following acts under 
the following circumstances: "
737,," ""(a) Undertook falsely to claim and fraudulently to appropriate, under color of their aforesaid agreement with the Ruler of 
Sharjah, all exploratory rights anywhere within an area bounded by a line twelve nautical miles seaward from the low water mark 
on the island of Abu Musa, notwithstanding the rights previously granted plaintiffs up to a line only three miles seaward from Abu 
Musa. ""(b) The agreement granting the Occidental concession provides, in part, that if petroleum in commercial quantities is not 
discovered within four years of its effective date, the agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect.  Defendants, 
knowing of this provision and for the purpose of causing the Occidental concession to lapse, on or about March 25, 1970, acting 
through Buttes, submitted to the British Political Agent in the Trucial States for approval, in accordance with the treaty mentioned 
in paragraph 16 above, plans prepared in the United States for drilling for oil and gas by Buttes for itself and Clayco at a location 
which defendants well knew was wholly within the area of the Occidental concession and wholly outside the area of the 
concession granted Buttes and Clayco by the Ruler of Sharjah.  The British Political Agent rejected said plans. ""(c) Defendants then induced the Ruler of Sharjah, for his own personal gain and benefit, to protest the rejection by the British 
Political Agent of the aforesaid plans of Buttes and falsely to assert and claim that the location therein specified was within the 
concession area granted to Buttes and Clayco by him. ""(d) Defendants further induced and procured the Ruler of Sharjah to present, in support of his assertion and claim, a decree 
purporting to have been made prior to the grant of the Occidental concession, but in fact prepared after said concession was 
granted, wherein and whereby the Ruler of Sharjah asserted in substance and effect that the territorial waters of Sharjah, its 
dependencies and islands extended twelve nautical miles seaward from their low water lines.  Said decree was in effect an 
attempted confiscation, without compensation, of plaintiffs' vested property rights in the oil and gas to which they were entitled 
under the aforesaid agreement between Occidental of Umm Al Qaywayn, Inc., and the Ruler of Umm Al Qaywayn, in violation of 
international law, which defendants arranged to have issued for the purpose of eliminating plaintiffs from competition with them 
in the exploration and production of oil from the seabed underlying the offshore waters of the Trucial States.  Neither said 
purported decree nor any claim of the Ruler of Sharjah such as that made therein, had theretofore been published or otherwise 
made known by the Ruler of Sharjah to the British Foreign Office, the British Political Agent in the Trucial States, the Ruler of 
Umm Al Qaywayn, or any of the rulers of the other Trucial States; in fact, in 1964 the Ruler of Sharjah had signed a statement 
acknowledging his offshore right to extend only to three miles seaward from Abu Musa. ""(e) The British Political Agent in the Trucial States rejected the protest and the decree of the Ruler of Sharjah and thereupon 
Buttes and Clayco induced and procured the Ruler of Sharjah, on or about April 2, 1970, to designate and appoint as his legal 
advisor in the matter one of the attorneys for Buttes and Clayco. ""(f) On or shortly after April 2, 1970, Buttes and Clayco and the Ruler of Sharjah submitted to the British Foreign Office for 
approval a purported amendment of the aforementioned agreement between them, which amendment purported to extend 
Buttes' and Clayco's drilling rights to a line twelve nautical miles seaward from the low water lines of Sharjah, its dependencies 
and islands, all in violation of international law and of the rights of the plaintiffs, as aforesaid. ""(g) Defendants induced and procured the Ruler of Sharjah to issue and publish a second purported decree dated April 5, 1970, 
purporting to supplement the aforementioned decree which had purported to have been made prior to the granting of the 
Occidental concession, which second decree attempted to appropriate the Occidental concession in violation of international 
law. ""(h) On May 16, 1970, after recommending the refusal of permission to Buttes and Clayco to drill outside their concession area, 
the British Foreign Office, pursuant to the treaty and undertaking set forth in paragraph 16 above, requested the Ruler of Sharjah 
to take no action to give effect to his aforementioned decrees and to make no further decrees and notified said Ruler that 
operations by plaintiffs were to proceed on the basis of the concession agreement as originally signed between the Ruler of 
Umm Al Qaywayn and Occidental of Umm Al Qaywayn, Inc.  Thereupon, in the latter part of May 1970, defendants induced and 
procured the National Iranian Oil Company to assert at this time that the island of Abu Musa was Iranian territory and that the 
territorial waters of Iran in respect of such island extend to a line twelve nautical miles seaward from its low water mark. ""(i) In the latter part of May 1970, defendants induced and procured personnel of the British Foreign Office to request of plaintiffs 
that they not commence drilling operations, which they were then prepared to commence, until June 1, 1970, pending the 
resolution of the claims of the Ruler of Sharjah and the National Iranian Oil Company with respect to the island of Abu Musa and 
its territorial waters, which said claims defendants had caused to be made in pursuance of their intent as aforesaid. ""23.  Beginning May 27, 1970, plaintiffs' personnel and equipment, standing ready near the Occidental concession to commence 
drilling operations, were menaced and threatened by armed surface ships and airplanes of the British Armed Forces.  On June 
1, 1970, plaintiffs' seagoing equipment was boarded under force by the British Royal Navy.  On June 3, 1970, over his protest "
738,," and acting under the threat of exile, and after his home had been buzzed by airplanes of the British Royal Air Force and 
surrounded by British soldiers, the Ruler of Umm Al Qaywayn directed plaintiffs not to drill in the area claimed to be within the 
territorial waters of Sharjah and Iran.  Plaintiffs were forced to abandon indefinitely their plans to commence drilling operations. """
738,12," The same day, Occidental of Umm Al Qaywayn, Inc., filed suit in Britain against the British government, seeking declaratory 
relief and damages as a result of this naval episode. "
739,13," For this reason Page v. Work, 290 F.2d 323 (9th Cir.), cert. den., 368 U.S. 875, 7 L. Ed. 2d 76, 82 S. Ct. 121 (1961), and 
David Cabrera, Inc. v. Union de Choferes y Duenos de Camiones Hermanados de Puerto Rico, 256 F. Supp. 839 (D.P.R. 1966), 
relied upon by defendants, are inapposite.  The standard of ""substantial effect"" laid down in those cases defines antitrust 
jurisdiction over restraints of intrastate, as contrasted with interstate, business.  See also Lieberthal v. North Country Lanes, 332 
F.2d 269 (2nd Cir. 1962); 1 J. Von Kalinowski, Antitrust and Trade Regulation § 5.014, at 5-98 -- 102 (1969)."
739,14," Compare Sherman Act § 1, 15 U.S.C. § 1 (""Every contract . . . in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or 
with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal . . ."") and Sherman Act § 2, 15 U.S.C. § 2 (""Every person who shall monopolize . . . 
any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor . 
. . ."") with Clayton Act §§ 4, 16, 15 U.S.C. §§ 15, 26 (incorporating by reference the former two sections)."
739,15," The Buttes defendants read the complaint as charging, at worst, that Buttes and Clayco, rather than plaintiffs, would obtain 
and import any oil derived from the disputed portion of the plaintiffs' concession.  From this they reason that no effect on 
American commerce is shown, because the oil would at all events enter the stream of commerce. This argument begs the issue.  
When control of an item in commerce is wrested from one competitor by another, the commerce of the article is to that extent 
""affected,"" regardless of the ultimate disposition of the commodity. "
740,16," Along similar lines, mediation has been instituted to attempt a resolution of the instant dispute between Sharjah and Umm Al 
Qaywayn.  As presented to this court in an exhibit, the terms of reference for the mediator -- who is to be appointed by the British 
government -- specify as one point of contention the respective rights of the oil concessionaires, parties to this case.  The terms 
of reference further prescribe that the mediator is to enjoy the assistance of these oil companies.  Iran is apparently not a party 
to this mediation. "

dissenting)."
741,18," Rule 19 provides as follows: Joinder of Persons Needed for Just Adjudication HN6[
] (a) Persons to be Joined if Feasible.  A person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not 
deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action shall be joined as a party in the action if (1) in his 
absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or (2) he claims an interest relating to the 
subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in his absence may (i) as a practical matter impair 
or impede his ability to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of 
incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of his claimed interest.  If he has not been so 
joined, the court shall order that he be made a party.  If he should join as a plaintiff but refuses to do so, he may be made a 
defendant, or, in a proper case, an involuntary plaintiff.  If the joined party objects to venue and his joinder would render the 
venue of the action improper, he shall be dismissed from the action. (b) Determination by Court Whenever Joinder not Feasible.  If a person as described in subdivision (a)(1) -- (2) hereof 
cannot be made a party, the court shall determine whether in equity and good conscience the action should proceed among 
the parties before it, or should be dismissed, the absent person being thus regarded as indispensable. The factors to be 
considered by the court include: first, to what extent a judgment rendered in the person's absence might be prejudicial to 
him or those already parties; second, the extent to which, by protective provisions in the judgment, by the shaping of relief, 
or other measures, the prejudice can be lessened or avoided; third, whether a judgment rendered in the person's absence 
will be adequate; fourth, whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder. (c) Pleading Reasons for Nonjoinder.  A pleading asserting a claim for relief shall state the names, if known to the pleader, 
of any persons as described in subdivision (a)(1) -- (2) hereof who are not joined, and the reasons why they are not joined. (d) Exception of Class Actions.  This rule is subject to the provisions of Rule 23."
741,19," It has not been made clear whether this is the intent of plaintiffs' request that ""a trust be impressed, for the benefit of plaintiffs, 
on all revenues derived by the defendants and by any and all persons acting directly or indirectly for or on their behalf, or for or "
742,," on behalf of any of them,"" Compl., Prayer 1(c), or whether this constructive trust demand envisions that Sharjah's share of the 
revenues be left alone.  The latter approach, as noted below, would alleviate the prejudice to Sharjah and to defendants."
742,20," There is authority to the effect that an antitrust suit will not be dismissed even in the absence of a co-conspirator whose 
contractual rights are directly challenged by the adjudication, or in any event stand to be adversely affected by it.  Martin v. 
Chandler, 85 F. Supp. 131 (S.D.N.Y. 1949); see United States v. National Lead Co., 63 F. Supp. 513, 525 & n. 8 (S.D.N.Y. 
1945), aff'd, 332 U.S. 319, 91 L. Ed. 2077, 67 S. Ct. 1634 (1947); contra, Bond v. Harris, 239 F. Supp. 427 (S.D.N.Y. 1964). The 
cases so holding apparently reflect the general doctrine that the courts will proceed to enforce ""public rights"" even where the 
contractual rights of absent parties are as a result jeopardized.  See National Licorice Co. v. NLRB, 309 U.S. 350, 84 L. Ed. 799, 
60 S. Ct. 569 (1940); SEC v. Royal Hawaiian Management Corp., Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) P91,982, No. 67-546-F (C.D. Cal., 
June 12, 1967).  In the present case, however, the fact that the absent co-conspirator is a foreign country could present 
countervailing considerations against the court's obstructing or countermanding the performance of a contract with it.  Cf. Note, 
Extraterritorial Application of the Antitrust Laws, 69 Harv. L. Rev. 1452, 1459-61 (1956)."

743,23," In reversing the decision below, the Court in Pennington reaffirmed that ""joint efforts to influence public officials do not violate 
the antitrust laws even though intended to eliminate competition."" 381 U.S. at 670; accord, Noerr, supra, 365 U.S. at 138-40. 
The Court went on to state that ""such conduct is not illegal, either standing alone or as part of a broader scheme itself violative of 
the Sherman Act."" 381 U.S. at 670."
743,24," In Pennington the Court similarly distinguished Continental Ore, emphasizing that ""the purchasing agent . . . was not a public 
official but the wholly owned subsidiary of an American corporation alleged to be a principal actor in the conspiracy."" 381 U.S. at

744,26," One authority extracts from Noerr and Continental Ore the notion that the antitrust laws do not apply to petitioning a 
democratic government.  P. Areeda, Antitrust Analysis 187 & n. 206 (1967).  This interpretation, not presently adopted herein, 
would in any event not cover much of the conduct alleged in the instant complaint. "
745,27," The more modern notion that Sherman Act jurisdiction may be grounded on effects in the United States or upon its commerce 
does not appear on the face of the opinion, but the general interpretation has been to regard the case as one in which no such 
jurisdictional facts were presented.  See Steele v. Bulova Watch Co., 344 U.S. 280, 288, 97 L. Ed. 319, 73 S. Ct. 252 (1952); W. 
Fugate, Foreign Commerce and the Antitrust Laws 30-31 (1958)."
745,28," Both the Sisal Sales and Continental Ore cases steer clear of attaching antitrust liability to sovereign conduct or its 
inducement.  The conspiracy attacked in Sisal Sales included not only the procurement of favorable foreign laws but also 
traditional independent market activity, and the Court noted the distinction, in the same breath with its holding distinguishing the 
""territorial"" aspect of American Banana -- ""The United States complain not merely of something done by another government at 
the instigation of private parties.  True, the conspirators were aided by discriminating legislation, but by their own deliberate acts, 
here and elsewhere, they brought about forbidden results within the United States."" 274 U.S. at 276; see the dissenting opinion 
of Biggs, C.J., in Noerr Motor Freight v. Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference, 273 F.2d 218, 226 (3rd Cir. 1959), rev'd, 365 U.S. 
127, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523 (1961). In Continental Ore, the Court was careful to find that the Canadian government had 
neither approved nor compelled any of the challenged anti-competitive actions taken by a co-conspirator while exercising 
discretionary powers granted by that government.  370 U.S. at 706-07; cf. id. at 707-08, discussed supra.  These cases, which 
based liability on market conduct in the context of governmental permission, do not help plaintiffs here, for the conspiracy 
presently pleaded is made up exclusively of the inducement of sovereign acts.  See 1 J.  Von Kalinowski, supra, § 5.02[3]b."
745,29," E.g., Steele v. Bulova Watch Co., 344 U.S. 280, 288, 97 L. Ed. 319, 73 S. Ct. 252 (1952); Fugate, Antitrust Jurisdiction and

746,30," Plaintiffs contended at one point that the claim by the National Iranian Oil Company (Compl. 22(h)) was the act of a private

nation.  See Waldron v. British Petroleum Corp., 231 F. Supp. 72, 77 (S.D.N.Y. 1964)."

justice.  Its dominant motif is political.  It has gained stature in the world of international diplomacy and politics, where an 
'incident' involving the dignity of nations is measured by its explosive potential as well as its legal implications."" "

747,33," Regardless of the wording of the complaint, it would be conceptually and prudentially hazardous to treat the territorial waters 
claims of Sharjah as a ""confiscation,"" subject to adjudication under the international legal standards governing that kind of act.  
Claims to territory are a different matter from the expropriation of corporate property within or appertaining to that territory, see 
Latvian State Cargo & Passenger S.S. Line v. United States, 126 Ct. Cl. 802, 116 F. Supp. 717, 720 (Ct. Cl. 1953). Moreover, 
territorial waters claims are subject to a body of international law wholly different from that relating to expropriations.  See 
generally M. McDougal & W. Burke, The Public Order of the Oceans 486-98, 520-61 (1962). "

779,1," Some authorities draw precise distinctions among the several expressions.  ""Bid chiseling"" is limited to the practice of a general 
contractor who solicits lower sub-bids after he has been awarded the prime contract.  ""Bid shopping"" is used to refer to such 
solicitation by general contractors before the award of the prime contract.  And ""bid peddling"" applies to the conduct of a 
subcontractor. (See People v. Inland Bid Depository (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 851, 863-864 [44 Cal.Rptr. 206]; Comment (1970) 
18 U.C.L.A. L.Rev. 389, 394.)"
779,2," Section 16720: HN1[
] ""A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more persons for any of the following 
purposes: (a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce.  . . .  (e) To make or enter into or execute or carry out any "
780,," contracts, obligations or agreements of any kind or description, by which they do all or any combination of any of the following: . . 
. (4) Agree to pool, combine or directly or indirectly unite any interests that they may have connected with the sale or 
transportation of any . . . article or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected."" Section 16726: HN2[
] ""Except as provided in this chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void."" "
781,3," Because the Cartwright Act is patterned after the federal Sherman Act and both have their roots in the common law, federal 
cases interpreting the Sherman Act are applicable in construing the Cartwright Act. ( Chicago Title Ins. Co. v. Great Western 
Financial Corp. (1968) 69 Cal.2d 305, 315 [70 Cal.Rptr. 849, 444 P.2d 481].) "
782,4," There is no contention that defendant engaged in the practice defined in the complaint as ""bid shopping."" Although also a form 
of price competition, bid shopping is less desirable than bid peddling because only the general contractor, and not the awarding 
authority or the public, benefits from this practice.  Post-award bid shopping is prohibited in California on public works 
construction projects by Government Code section 4104, which requires general contractors, at the time they submit their prime 
bids, to list the names of the subcontractors whose bids were accepted in the computation of their prime bids. Thus, general 
contractors are not free to solicit lower subbids once they have been awarded the prime contract.  (See Comment (1970) supra, 
18 U.C.L.A. L.Rev. 389, 396, 402-404.) "
783,5," In the system of bidding between general contractors and the awarding authority, the latter always has available the means by 
which it can increase competition among general contractors and arrive at lower prime bids. If, fortuitously or by collusion, all of 
the prime bids submitted on a particular project are too high, the awarding authority may simply reject all of them and reopen 
bidding on the project. "
784,6," Despite this unequivocal language, the circuit court, in affirming the district court's decision, sought to limit the holding: ""It was 
suggested that Rule V alone constituted a per se violation of Section 1; however, since the decision was based on the combined 
effect of Rules V, III and VIII, and their implementation, we need not determine whether a per se violation occurred."" (352 F.2d at 
p. 819, fn. 5.) "
785,7," Referring to the rule requiring general contractors to accept the lowest bid submitted through the depository, the Court of 
Appeal stated: ""To require the general contractor to employ the lowest bid under 8B, at a time when he had seen no other 
subbids, would be detrimental to the public, leading to collusion by the subcontractors and ruinous to the construction industry."" 
(233 Cal.App.2d at pp. 859-860.) "
788,1," In his complaint plaintiff named as defendants each of the twelve clubs in each of the two major leagues, and, also, in the 
antitrust cause of action, the presidents of each league, Charles S. Feeney and Joseph E. Cronin, and the Commissioner of 
Baseball, Bowie K. Kuhn, individually and in their respective official capacities. "
789,2," It is well settled that HN2[
] denial of certiorari by the Supreme Court does not indicate any decision with reference to the 
merits of a case.  United States v. Shubert, 348 U.S. 222, 99 L. Ed. 279, 75 S. Ct. 277 (1955); Agoston v. Pennsylvania, 340 
U.S. 844, 95 L. Ed. 619, 71 S. Ct. 9 (1950). This would seem to be particularly true in Salerno where the plaintiffs, being 
umpires, were not subject to the provisions of a player's reserve clause and had ""exceedingly difficult obstacles"" to overcome in 
addition to Federal Baseball and Toolson. 429 F.2d at 1005."
789,3," It should be noted that in 1949 two distinguished members of this court, Judge Learned Hand and Judge Jerome Frank, 
confidently predicted the overruling of Federal Baseball insofar as that holding dealt with the reserve system.  Gardella v. 
Chandler, 172 F.2d 402 (2 Cir. 1949). In particular, Judge Frank stated: ""This court cannot, of course, tell the Supreme Court that it was once wrong.  But 'one should not wait for formal retraction 
in the face of changes plainly foreshadowed;' this court's duty is 'to divine, as best it can, what would be the event of the 
appeal in the case before it.' L. Hand, C. J., dissenting in Spector Motor Service Co. v. Walsh, 2 Cir., 139 F.2d 809, 823."" 
172 F.2d at 409 n. 1. Inasmuch as shortly thereafter, in 1953, Toolson proved these distinguished jurists' prediction to be premature, we do not 
venture to prophesy the Supreme Court's decision in the present case. "
790,4," Plaintiff acknowledges that, since Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 82 L. Ed. 1188, 58 S. Ct. 817 (1938), the common 
law to be applied in federal court is the common law of the individual states.  However, he urges that a federal common antitrust 
law may be appropriate where uniformity among the states is needed.  Inasmuch as federal antitrust policy is embodied in Acts 
of Congress, this approach would seem to be merely an attempt to avoid Toolson by entering through the back door. With reference to applying state common law to the problem here, it is obvious that the arguments based upon varying state 
statutory antitrust standards are equally applicable to the common law of the several states."
790,5," Compare Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines, 359 U.S. 520, 527, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1003, 79 S. Ct. 962 (1959), with Huron Portland Cement

791,7," We leave to the commentators the relevance of Mr. Justice Holmes' much-quoted comment on precedent to his opinion in 
Federal Baseball and the decision in Toolson: It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV.  It is still more 
revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind 
imitation of the past.  Oliver Wendell Holmes, Path of the Law, 10 Harv. L. Rev. 457, 469 (1897)."
791,8," Unlike the ballplayers, baseball management has been quite adept at forecasting legal decisions.  In Federal Baseball counsel 
for the defendants opened his argument: ""Organized Baseball is not interstate commerce . . ."" 259 U.S. 200, 206, 42 S. Ct. 465, 
66 L. Ed. 898 (1922). Having obtained an exemption from the Sherman Act under the legal standards of 1922, professional 
baseball can now properly urge that baseball in 1971 is indeed both interstate and international commerce. "

the Armory Board, concluding that the restrictive covenant in the lease was in violation of the antitrust laws. On the basis of a 
contrary opinion from a private law firm, however, the Board adhered to its position that the lease's restrictive clause was binding

807,6," 438 F.2d 1286 (5th Cir. 1971). Though Woods never referred to Alabama Power Co. v. Alabama Electric Cooperative, 394 F.2d 
672 (5th Cir. 1968), it is obvious that its rationale, based as it is on the proposition that ""not every governmental act . . . points a 
path to an antitrust shelter,"" represents a significant shift in the Fifth Circuit away from the views of the majority in Alabama 
Power, which was based upon the flat assertion that ""it is settled that neither the Sherman Act nor the Clayton Act was intended 
to authorize restraint of governmental action,"" id., at 675, towards the rationale of Judge Godbold's dissent in that case.  In 
language expressive of the approach we take here, Judge Godbold stated: Congress can, and in numerous instances by express legislation has, subordinated the national policies reflected in the 
antitrust laws so as to authorize government officials to perform acts or pursue policies without regard to the antitrust laws. . 
. . The courts carefully have limited these expressly conferred immunities to the scope defined in each instance by 
Congress so as to avoid pro tanto repeal of the antitrust laws. Id., at 680. And, The cases do not support a proposition of general governmental immunity. If there is such a principle Congress has been 
proceeding for a long time under a misapprehension in providing for government officers, and those with whom they deal, 
exemptions which are specific in nature and varying in scope.  Id., at 685."

809,17," Years later the Fourth Circuit explained some of the limitations inherent in Parker v. Brown: The teaching of Parker v. Brown is that the antitrust laws are directed against individual and not state action. When a state 
has a public policy against free competition in an industry important to it, the state may regulate that industry in order to 
control or, in a proper case, to eliminate competition therein.  It may even permit persons subject to such control to 
participate in the regulation, provided their activities are adequately supervised by independent state officials. . . . . . . . . But 
such action must be state action, not individual action masquerading as state action. A state can neither authorize 
individuals to perform acts which violate the antitrust laws nor declare that such action is lawful.  Asheville Tobacco Board 
of Trade, Inc. v. F.T.C., (4th Cir. 1959), 263 F.2d 502, 509. Cf. the most recent Fourth Circuit decision following Parker,  Washington Gas Light Co. v. Virginia Electric and Power Co., 438 F.2d 248, 39 U.S.L.W. 2453-54, (4th Cir. 12 Feb. 1971). See also the recent decision of the Fifth Circuit in Gas Light Co. of Columbus v. Georgia Power Co., 440 F.2d 1135, 1137, 39 
L.W. 2545, 2546 (5th Cir., 23 March 1971), where in considering the antitrust implications of the adoption by the Georgia Public 
Service Commission, regulating industry of undeniable importance to the state, the court said: Each of these acts and practices are rate schedules and each has been considered by the Georgia Public Service 
Commission in an adversary proceeding.  Each is effective by order of the commission. . . . Defendant's conduct cannot be 
characterized as individual action when we consider the state's intimate involvement with the rate-making process.  Though 
the rates and practices originated with the regulated utility, Georgia Power, the facts make it plain that they emerged from 
the commission as the products of the commission.  They are thus immune from the operation of the antitrust laws under 
the Parker exemption. The result reached differs from that by the same Circuit in Woods, but is justified by the fact that, although a state regulatory 
agency is involved in each instance, in Woods the action of the agency was alleged to be influenced by the illegal agreement 
among the private parties to furnish false data, while no such circumstance was alleged in Gas Light.  However, the approach of 
Judge Bell in Gas Light gave more weight to the sheer existence of state action than did the attempt to reconcile antitrust and 
regulatory policies of Judge Goldberg in Woods or Judge Godbold dissenting in Alabama Power, perhaps because such 
comparative analysis was simply not called for on the facts of Gas Light."

defendants asserted that the purchasing agent was acting as an administrator of the Canadian Government and that the 
conduct was therefore privileged under Parker.  The Supreme Court, stressing that there was no evidence that the 
Canadian Government had approved of the conduct of its agent, held that such conduct was subject to the Sherman Act.

815,56," Two recent decisions of our court should be noted, although the issue of the non-applicability of the federal antitrust laws was 
not directly raised.  In Marine Space Enclosures, Inc. v. F.M.C., 137 U.S. App. D.C. 9, 420 F.2d 577 (1969), FMC approval of a 
contract between New York City and the New York Port Authority containing restrictive covenants was challenged.  This court 
remanded the case to the Commission for further proceedings fully exploring the antitrust questions arising from the restraints in 
the contracts.  It may be implied from this ruling that even though the antitrust laws do not invalidate contracts approved by the 
Federal Maritime Commission, and this contract was between government entities, yet the responsible governmental body, i.e., 
the FMC, was required to give due consideration to national antitrust policy.  In National Aviation Trades Association v. C.A.B., 
136 U.S. App. D.C. 367, 420 F.2d 209 (1969), this court had before it an airport management contract between Pan American 
Airways and the New York Port Authority, somewhat similar to that involved in Wiggins Airways, supra. The Federal Aviation Act 
requires the CAB to weigh the antitrust considerations, and hence this court reviewed the record supporting the Board's findings 
that the contract would not create a monopoly in violation of the national antitrust policy. "

832,2," Compare Anderson v. Abbott, 321 U.S. 349, 362, 64 S. Ct. 531, 88 L. Ed. 793 (1944)."
832,3," We reject Greenberg's contention that the notice to appear was improper under Rule 62(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure, which bars proceedings taken for the enforcement of a judgment until the expiration of 10 days after its entry.  
Judgment against PSG was entered on August 16, 1967.  Although the notice sent to Greenberg on August 20th was invalid 
under Rule 62(a), Greenberg was given a new, valid notice dated August 28, 1967.  We also reject Greenberg's suggestion that 
the attempted examination was barred by El Salto's failure to comply with Oregon state procedural rules.  A judgment creditor 
proceeding under Rule 69(a) may utilize either state practice or the Federal Rules for taking depositions. See Burak v. Scott, 29 
F. Supp. 775, 776 (D.D.C.1939); 7 Moore's Federal Practice, par. 69.06, p. 2421 (1970). "
843,1," Paragraph Eighth provides in relevant part: ""The Bureau shall and it is hereby authorized to deduct, as compensation for its 
services, fifteen (15%) per cent of all sums collected for the account of the Publisher. . . .  In the event any sums are paid directly 
to the Publisher for any advertisements covered by this agreement, the Publisher shall render a true and correct account thereof 
to the Bureau and shall pay to the Bureau within thirty days after receipt of said sums, a sum equal to fifteen (15%) per cent of 
the amount paid to the Publisher."" With reference to this paragraph of the contract, Telford Work, Secretary-Treasurer of the 
Bureau, in his affidavit in support of the motion for summary judgment, states: ""Advertisers are of course free to go directly to the 
newspaper and place their legal advertising as many do, just as any other members of the general public also do, and there is 
no prohibition of any kind against this.  However, the Bureau under its representation agreements would still be entitled to its 
15% commission."" "
844,2," Paragraph Second provides in relevant part: ""The Publisher hereby retains the services of the Bureau as representative of the 
Publisher for soliciting and servicing of all legal advertising . . . provided, however, the Publisher reserves the right to withdraw, 
at any time by notification in writing to the Bureau, from the terms of this agreement, the following classes of legal advertising:     
[Par.] In the event the Publisher exercises the withdrawal privilege herein contained, Publisher agrees to and does hereby waive 
during the period of such withdrawal the right to participate in the distributions and/or credits contemplated under paragraph 
Ninth hereof."" Paragraph Ninth provides for the annual pro-rata distributions of the Bureau's profits as discussed above."
844,3," In its supplemental brief filed in this court, the Bureau, for the first time herein, contends that while the literal language of the 
contract appears to dictate the total waiver of any right to profits as stated above, the actual practice has been to allow member 
newspapers which have excluded certain classes of legal advertising from their contract to participate in the distribution of net 
profits to the extent of the commissions they paid to the Bureau on nonexcluded classes.  Since no such facts appear in the 
record, we cannot now consider this contention.  However, to the extent that such facts are relevant, they may be proved at trial. "
845,4," The only member newspapers named as defendants in the complaint are those which publish in judicial districts in which every 
newspaper qualified to carry legal advertisements is a member of the Bureau."
845,5," Hereafter, unless otherwise indicated, all section references are to the Business and Professions Code."
845,6," ""We first consider HN2[
] the affidavits of the moving party. They 'must contain facts sufficient to entitle . . . defendant to a judgment in the action.  . . .' ( Code Civ. Proc., § 437c.) To prevail, therefore, such affidavits 'must state facts establishing every 
element necessary to sustain a judgment in his favor.' [Citation.] Such facts 'shall be set forth with particularity' ( Code Civ. Proc., 
§ 437c) and shall be within the personal knowledge of the affiant, the affidavit to show that the affiant, if sworn as a witness, can 
testify competently thereto.  As the court stated in House v. Lala, supra, [180 Cal.App.2d 412 (4 Cal.Rptr. 366)] '[to] HN3[
] 
satisfy the statutory requirement of ""particularity,"" the movant's affidavits must state all the requisite evidentiary facts and not 
merely the ultimate facts.  [Citations.] Moreover, neither conclusions of law nor conclusions of fact are sufficient to satisfy the 
statutory requirement.  [Citation.]'"" ( Snider v. Snider (1962) 200 Cal.App.2d 741, 748-749 [19 Cal.Rptr. 709].) HN4[
] ""It is therefore well settled that summary judgment cannot be ordered for the moving party, even though the affidavits of 
the opposing party be insufficient or absent, unless the moving part presents affidavits in support of his motion which comply 
with the statute and show that he is entitled to judgment.  [Citations.] As is stated in Southern Pacific Co. v. Fish, supra, [166 
Cal.App.2d 353 (333 P.2d 133)] 'there first must be a sufficiently supportive affidavit before the defects of any counteraffidavit, 
either of form or substance, need be examined; . . .'"" (Original italics; de Echeguren v. de Echeguren (1962) 210 Cal.App.2d 
141, 147 [26 Cal.Rptr. 562].) "
846,7," Section 16720 provides in relevant part: HN8[
] ""A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more persons for any of the following purposes: [Par.] (a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce. . . ."" Section 16726 provides: 
""Except as provided in this chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void."""
846,8," Section 16727 provides in relevant part: HN9[
] ""It shall be unlawful for any person to . . . make a sale or contract for the sale 
of goods, merchandise, machinery, supplies, commodities for use within the State, or to fix a price charged therefor, or discount 
from, or rebate upon, such price, on the condition, agreement or understanding that the . . . purchaser thereof shall not use or 
deal in the goods, merchandise, machinery, supplies, commodities, or services of a competitor . . . where the effect of such . . . 
sale, or contract for sale or such condition, agreement or understanding may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to 
create a monopoly in any line of trade or commerce in any section of the State."" "
847,9," Defendants contend that Statewide has no standing to raise these claims because it does not compete with the Bureau and 
has therefore suffered no injury as a result of whatever restrictions in trade the agreements may generate.  While it is true that 
Statewide does not offer to represent newspapers in the same manner as the Bureau, our summation of the facts demonstrates 
that in the area of publication of notices of trustee's sales; Statewide and the Bureau offer nearly identical services.  Since they 
compete in the latter area, Statewide has standing to sue. The Bureau also claims that Statewide has suffered no injury because its members were never under any obligation to pay 
commissions to Statewide. Statewide replies that the newspapers have a customary and quasicontractual duty to pay such 
commissions.  These opposing arguments cannot be resolved on the basis of the declarations on file."
847,10," A facsimile of the agreement has been attached as an exhibit to, and made a part of, the Bureau's declaration in support of its 
motion as well as Statewide's declaration in opposition to the motion.  Thus, the terms of this document are undisputed. "
848,11," The Bureau also contends that any restrictive effect arising from its agreements is caused by the legally sanctioned monopoly 
held by newspapers qualified to publish legal advertisements. As we have seen, however, the restrictive effect flows from the 
terms of the agreements themselves, and not from the statutes governing ""newspapers of general circulation"" within the 
meaning of the Government Code.  ( Gov. Code, §§ 6000- 6078.) The further argument that the contract provisions are justified because they allow the Bureau to act as a clearing house for legal 
notices in the County of Los Angeles again presents a question of fact which should be determined at trial."
848,12," Since we find that there are triable issues of fact as to whether the representation agreements are tying arrangements violative 
of sections 16720 and 16726, we need not determine whether the agreements also independently violate section 16727. "
849,13," However, we deem it unnecessary to determine whether this tying effect is sufficient to bring the agreement within the per se 
rule established by the United States Supreme Court cases cited above.  Most cases involving tying arrangements have dealt 
with situations where the seller absolutely refused to sell one product separately from another.  Here, there is no such refusal, 
but a higher price is exacted for the tying product if the tied product is not also purchased.  Such an arrangement appears to 
present many of the same evils inherent in a classic tying arrangement within the prohibition of section 16726.  ( Federal Trade 
Com'n v. Paramount Famous-Lasky Corp. (2d Cir. 1932) 67 F.2d 152, 155; Washington Gas Light Co. v. Virginia Electric & 
Power Co. (E.D.Va. 1970) 309 F.Supp. 1119, 1125; Turner, The Validity of Tying Arrangements Under the Antitrust Laws (1958) 
72 Harv.L.Rev. 50, 65-73.) "
850,14," We also note that it will be necessary for the trial court to determine the dollar-volume of business foreclosed by any tying 
arrangement which it may find inherent in paragraph Second.  (See Fortner Enterprises v. U.S. Steel, supra, 394 U.S. 495, 501 
[22 L.Ed.2d 495, 503].) The declarations filed in this case are of no assistance on this vital issue. "
853,1," The district court's action is appealable as a final order under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Chatham Shipping Co. v. Fertex S. S. Corp., 
352 F.2d 291, 294 (2d Cir. 1965); 9 Moore's Fed.Practice para. 110.20 [4.-1] (1) (2d ed. 1970).  The district court also denied 
appellant's motion to stay arbitration. Although appellant formally appealed from this ruling as well, he did not press the matter at 
oral argument, recognizing problems with the appealability of such a ruling.  See Greater Continental Corp. v. Schechter, 422 
F.2d 1100 (2d Cir. 1970); 9 Moore's Fed. Practice para. 110.20 [4.-1] (3) (2d ed. 1970).  In any case, the same issues are raised 
by both court orders, and the New York Stock Exchange has notified the appellee that it will not process its arbitration claim 
pending completion of this phase of the litigation in the federal courts. "

869,11," Membership in a contract market is a prerequisite to lawful trading in commodities futures.  Title 7, U.S.C.A. § 6. Therefore, 
Rule 307, allegedly violated in the transfer of appellant's membership, and Rule 322, allegedly violated in the attempt to cancel 
appellant's authorization to trade, both relate to ""trading requirements."" The other alleged violation was the failure to enforce 
financial reporting rules."

dismissed an antitrust action against defendant carriers who had allegedly agreed not to parallel each other's routes.  The Civil 
Aeronautics Board was vested with broad jurisdiction over the air carrier.  The Court reasoned at 305: ""Limitation of routes and divisions of territories and the relation of common carriers to air carriers are basic in this regulatory 
scheme. The acts charged in this civil suit as antitrust violations are precise ingredients of the Board's authority in granting, 
qualifying, or denying certificates to air carriers, in modifying, suspending, or revoking them, and in allowing or disallowing 
affiliations between common carriers and air carriers.""  Although the overall regulatory scheme in the instant case is less pervasive than the scheme in Pan American, the specific 
allegations relate directly to the Commission's and the Secretary's power to designate contract markets and allow the trading in 
futures by individuals.  Such power is no less basic to the regulatory scheme than it was in Pan American.  Also, compare Far 
East Conference v. United States, 342 U.S. 570, 96 L. Ed. 576, 72 S. Ct. 492 (1952); United States Nav. Co. v. Cunard S. S.

(1962); United States v. Borden Co., 308 U.S. 188, 84 L. Ed. 181, 60 S. Ct. 182 (1939), for ample illustration of Chief Judge

further say that the principal purpose of treble damages seems to be punishment which will deter the violator and others from 
future illegal acts."""
870,18," We express no opinion on any antitrust immunity that might result from action or inaction taken by the Commission or the 
Secretary of Agriculture in this case.  The complicated issues of reconciliation of the Commodities Exchange Act and the

Since Judge Pell concurred in that part of Judge Campbell's opinion which remanded the remaining issues to the district court, 
he must have concluded that primary jurisdiction was inappropriate."
872,6," I merely observe that antitrust law is not within the peculiar province of the Secretaries of Agriculture and Commerce.  Of 
course, quite the opposite is true of the Attorney General who is the chief enforcement officer of the anti-trust laws and who 
could possibly be placed in an inconsistent position in having to judge those suits. "

Oil Company, et al. (Civil Action No. 780-68) are parallel cases presently before this Court.  The same defendants are charged 
by distributors and dealers of gasoline with violations of the Sherman and Clayton Acts.  Plaintiffs in the D'Ippolito cases allege a 
conspiracy by defendants to raise the prices of and restrict the quantity of gasoline available to them for the purpose of 
unlawfully forcing them out of business. "
893,2," This Court is of the opinion that the notice requirements of Rule 23(c)(2) can be satisfied in all three of the proposed class 
actions.  Defendants' arguments centered upon the difficulties defendants envisioned in giving satisfactory notice to members of 
the proposed Philadelphia-New Jersey class.  Even then those arguments focused upon the largest segment in terms of 
numbers within the class: motorists who purchased at retail service stations. Because of the disposition this opinion makes of 
this latter portion of the Philadelphia-New Jersey class, it would be academic to examine the arguments presented by both 
sides."
893,3," Two of the originally named defendants in each of the four consumer actions were The Atlantic Refining Company and Sinclair 
Refining Company.  Subsequent to the filing of the consumer actions but prior to the filing of memoranda and briefs on the class 
action issues, these two corporations agreed to merge.  The combined corporation is referred to in this opinion as ""Atlantic 
Richfield""."
893,4," Philadelphia-New Jersey have agreed to settle with American Oil Company and Atlantic Richfield.  Pursuant to a motion made 
by Philadelphia-New Jersey for approval of the settlement agreements and establishment of temporary settlement classes 
identical to the class they seek to maintain in the litigation, oral argument was heard by this Court immediately after completion 
of oral argument on the class action issues.  American Oil and Atlantic Richfield opposed the motion.  Basically, the settling 
defendants argued that if this Court refused to certify the class Philadelphia-New Jersey seek to represent in their consumer 
action, the settlement agreements would become null and void.  Thus there should be no approval of these agreements until the 
Court has decided the class action issues. Philadelphia-New Jersey rebutted by distinguishing between settlement classes and 
litigating classes and interpreted the settlement agreements differently.  This Court, after a careful consideration of the 
arguments presented, adjourned the pending motions without date, choosing to decide the class action issues first."
893,5," Since oral argument, counsel for Philadelphia-New Jersey and defendant Chevron Oil Company (the successor to the originally 
named California Oil Company) have brought to the Court's attention the terms of a third settlement between these respective 
parties.  Its terms are somewhat analogous to the terms of the American and Atlantic Richfield settlements. "
894,6," Defendants state in opposition to the maintenance of these actions as class actions, that in 1967 alone there were 18,399 retail 
dealers ""primarily engaged in selling gasoline"" in the three state area.  In addition, there were more than 14,000 other retail 
outlets such as garages, repair shops, and food stores at which gasoline was sold. "
902,7," The court, at the same time, upheld a count of the complaint in which the State of Hawaii sued in its parens patriae capacity for 
the people of Hawaii.  After rendering his oral opinion, Judge Pence inquired whether either party wished certification for appeal 
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).  Defendants requested, and were granted, certification on the parens patriae issue.  The State 
of Hawaii accepted the court's adverse ruling on class certification and did not request leave to appeal that determination. "

The Upjohn Co."

921,6," By the term ""farm"" cases, the court understands the defendants to be referring to those cases in which claims arising from the 
purchase of broad spectrum antibiotics for nonhuman use are asserted.  These claims are now presented within the framework 
of three separate class actions: Midwest Veterinary Supply, Inc. v. American Cyanamid Co., 69 Civ. 1557 (wholesalers); E.J. 
Hoffert v. American Cyanamid Co., 70 Civ. 367 (veterinarians); Doughboy Industries, Inc. v. American Cyanamid Co., 69 Civ. 
1558 (purchasers of broad spectrum antibiotics for nonhuman use directly from defendants or in the same form as originally sold 
by defendants).  By the term ""foreign cases,"" the court understands the defendants to be referring to two actions: Republic of 
Vietnam v. Chas. Pfizer & Co., 70 Civ. 877; State of Kuwait v. Chas. Pfizer & Co., 69 Civ. 4091.  The fact that certain other 
cases, such as the actions by seven states and the competitor cases, may assert foreign or farm claims gives further support to 
the court's reading of the plaintiff's Pretrial Brief, advanced infra."
921,7," Paragraphs 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the complaint, attached to the opinion as Appendix A, allege the fraudulent procurement of the 
Conover Patent, the restraint of trade in antibiotics and the monopolization of that industry. "
922,8," The defendants have not contended, and the court does not understand them to contend, that the cases other than the farm 
and foreign cases are not based on the prior proceedings."
922,9," The defendants advance the additional argument that the original complaints in these cases, which admittedly track the 
criminal indictment, evidence a ""sham"" reliance on the prior proceedings and should be disregarded.  Leh v. General Petroleum 
Corp., supra at 59. Because the Court interprets the Plaintiffs' Preliminary Pretrial Brief as an amendment to these complaints 
and because the court has concluded that the actions, interpreted in this manner, are based on the prior proceedings, it is 
unnecessary to consider this argument. "
923,10," The parties have not argued and the court does not pass on the applicability of the doctrine of collateral estoppel to these 
cases.  See, Purex Corp., Ltd. v. Procter & Gamble Co., 308 F. Supp. 584, 589-90 (C.D. Cal. 1970). In an amicus brief, counsel 
for certain hospital patients seeking intervention in the state class actions argues that § 5(c) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45(c) 
gives the findings of the FTC conclusive effect in these actions.  The court can find no support for this assertion in the legislative 
history or case law and rejects it without further discussion. "

949,5," Tilghman v. Proctor, 125 U.S. 136, 8 S. Ct. 894, 31 L. Ed. 664 (1888), and other patent cases relied on by TWA do not involve 
the question of when interest begins to run on a judgment, but rather from when interest as an element of damages should be 
measured.  The holding of the cases cited is that interest should run from the date that the fact and amount of damages cease to 
be ""in earnest controversy and of uncertain issue,"" id., at 161, 8 S. Ct. at 907, an event marked by the filing of the Master's 
report.  Since we determine that moratory interest is inappropriate here, these cases are inapplicable.  In L.P. Larson, Jr., Co. v. 
Wm. Wrigley, Jr., Co., 20 F.2d 830 (7th Cir. 1927), a trademark and unfair competition case, the question at issue was also the 
time from which interest would be assessed ""as an element of damages."" Id. at 836. See also Carter Products, Inc. v. Colgate-
Palmolive Co., 214 F. Supp. 383, 417-18 (D. Md. 1963). "
955,1," From the organization's beginning in 1952 until 1959, the franchisees were required to purchase, in addition to the cookers and 
fryers, the batter mix and two types of packaging. Additional packaging items were added in 1959 and in 1961; and in 1963, the 
beginning of the period in question in this suit, barbecue rib seasoning mix which had previously been specified to and made by 
the franchisees became a required item.  More packaging items were added in 1963 and 1964. "
956,2," Appellant, in urging us not to distinguish between the trade-mark and the product it represents, relies in part upon Supreme 
Court language to the effect that there is no property in a trade-mark except as a right appurtenant to an established business in 
connection with which the mark is employed.  United Drug Co. v. Theodore Rectanus Co., 248 U.S. 90, 97, 63 L. Ed. 141, 39 S. 
Ct. 48 (1918). But the Court did not mean that a mark and the product or business which it identifies are one and the same; it 
meant simply that, unlike a copyright or a patent, a trade-mark does not confer upon its owner the right to prohibit a competitor's 
use of the mark unless the owner himself uses the mark in connection with an existing business."

957,4," It should be readily apparent that, measured against these tests, the package sales here in question are quite different from the 
sale of an automobile and its tires or a left shoe and the right.  In particular, there are several factors in this case which other 
courts have deemed sufficient to find a tie-in. Undisputed testimony at trial established that other franchisors in fast food 
businesses similar to that of Chicken Delight sold their licenses separate from the essential supplies.  The various supplies sold 
here were sold individually and in differing amounts, rather than in a preassembled package, and the franchisees were billed 
accordingly.  At no time were the franchisees required to purchase all their various supplies from Chicken Delight.  Chicken 
Delight did not itself manufacture the tied items.  See Associated Press v. Taft-Ingalls Corp., 340 F.2d 753, 764 (6th Cir. 1965);

959,7," Our conclusion conflicts with that of the majority of the Susser case, supra, at 518-21, which, after a careful review of the facts 
in that case, held that sufficient economic power had not been demonstrated.  But the Susser court understood the economic 
power test to require a showing of ""market dominance."" We think that interpretation has since been rejected by the Supreme 
Court in Fortner Enterprises, Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., supra."
959,8, It bears noting that Chicken Delight's competitors in the fast food franchising business did not find it necessary to use tie-ins.
959,9," There may, of course, be cases where some extraordinary condition forecloses specification, e.g., where it would divulge a 
trade secret. "
960,10," Chicken Delight asserts error in the instructions given.  In our view, however, the essential question -- whether specification 
under the circumstances was practicable -- was properly presented to the jury. "
961,11," Were appellant's position correct, there could never be treble damage recovery by tie-in purchasers, since damage could 
never be demonstrated.  This broad principle has already been rejected by this court, which has recognized the right of 
purchasers under illegal tying arrangements to collect treble damages for over-charges.  See Lessig v. Tidewater Oil Co., 327 
F.2d 459, 471-72 (9th Cir. 1964); see also Osborn v. Sinclair Refining Company, 324 F.2d 566, 570 (4th Cir. 1963). "

CATV systems serving more than 3500 subscribers to originate programing was set aside on the grounds that such a regulation 
would force CATV operators into an entirely different business from that in which they are now engaged.  However, we note that 
the rejection of such potentially confiscatory rules is not tantamount to a denial of the power to regulate."
985,3," United States v. Southwestern Cable Co., supra."
985,4," HN10[
] (47 U.S.C. § 152(a) ""The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all interstate and foreign communication by wire or radio and all interstate and foreign transmission of energy by radio, which originates and/or is received within the United States, 
and to all persons engaged within the United States in such communication * * *"") "
987,5," Petitioner Rochester Telephone Corp. (Rochester) argues that it should be exempt under Section 2(b) (1), [47 U.S.C. § 152(b) 
(1)] which pertains to ""charges, classifications, practices, services, facilities, or regulations for or in connection with intrastate 
communication service by wire or radio of any carrier."" (Emphasis supplied).  In view of the Supreme Court's holding that CATV 
systems are engaged in interstate communication, we cannot agree.  Nor as Intervenor Lincoln Telephone and Telegraph 
Company (Lincoln) suggests does Section 221(b) apply.  That section exempts from Commission regulation facilities ""for or in 
connection with * * * telephone exchange service"" which is defined in Section 3(r) of the Act [47 U.S.C. § 153(r)] as: ""service 
within a telephone exchange, or within a connected system of telephone exchanges within the same exchange area operated to 
furnish to subscribers intercommunicating service of the character ordinarily furnished by a single exchange, and which is 
covered by the exchange service charge."" Clearly CATV channel distribution does not fit within that definition."
987,6," For instance the Commerce Commission has the difficult task of balancing one form of transportation against another in order 
to ""preserve the inherent advantages"" of each and ""to foster sound economic conditions in transportation""; additionally it is 
charged with responsibility for safety in the industry, fair wages and working conditions, and cooperation with state regulatory 
agencies.  None of these requirements appears in the Communications Act. "
988,7," For instance the Commission inquired into such diverse matters as the possibility and ramifications of common carriers acting 
as program originators, the effects of CATV affiliation upon regular telephone service consumers, the role of state and local 
authorities in CATV franchising, and the incentives for independent CATV operators to operate also as common carriers. "
989,8," Petitioners point to Section 7 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 18) and Sections 212, 215 and 314 of the Communications 
Act. "
990,9," Intervenor Lincoln asserts that the Commission cannot regulate or prohibit a common carrier's entry into a noncarrier business, 
i. e., CATV.  It is true, as Lincoln suggests, that HN25[
] CATV is not a common carrier service.  Philadelphia Television Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 123 U.S.App.D.C. 298, 359 F.2d 282 (1966). However, the reach of Section 214 is not confined to 
certification of common carrier facilities.  The section provides that ""no carrier"" shall construct ""a new line"" without prior 
certification, ""line"" being defined as ""any channel of communication established by the use of appropriate equipment."" The 
construction of CATV channel facilities is the building of a ""line"" to be used in interstate communications, and therefore, it is 
subject to Section 214 certification, even though CATV is not a common carrier service. "
991,10," Alternatively, Intervenor Lincoln asserts that the pole space requirement forces it to supply a competitor with the means of 
competition.This is simply a different perspective on the issue raised by petitioners.  Both advance the proposition that the pole 
space rule unlawfully requires the telephone companies to surrender their private property to someone else, i. e., independent 
CATV operators.  The same analysis, therefore, suffices for both."
991,11," Careful analysis of the rules, confirms that this is so:"
991,1," ) The definition of CATV is confined to facilities which transmit programs broadcast by one or more television stations.  (Sec. 
74.1101)"
991,2," ) Section 63.54 deals with applications by telephone companies for authority ""to construct or operate distribution facilities for 
channel service to CATV systems in their service areas."" The key words here are ""to CATV systems"".  That phrase modifies the 
meaning of the preceding words and clearly indicates that the rule applies only to facilities intended to serve CATV purposes."
991,3," ) Section 63.57 is couched in terms substantially identical to those of Section 63.54.  Additionally this rule avers to ""the 
independent CATV system proposed to be served * * *."" Thus if the telephone company does not propose to operate a CATV 
system itself (or through an affiliate) or to serve an independent CATV operator the rule has no application."
991,4," ) Section 64.601 prohibits the ""furnishing of CATV service to the viewing public"" in the telephone company's service area.  
Clearly the rule has no application to other broadband uses."
991,12," E. g. Associated Press v. United States, 326 U.S. 1, 65 S. Ct. 1416, 89 L. Ed. 2013 (1945); Silver v. New York Stock 
Exchange, 373 U.S. 341, 83 S. Ct. 1246, 10 L. Ed. 2d 389 (1963). "
992,13," Petitioners appear to argue that the pole space requirement is more stringent than the comparable remedies applied in the 
Terminal case and others cited n. 11, supra.  Even if that were conceded the remedy selected here is entirely consistent with 
United Shoe Machinery Corp. v. United States, 258 U.S. 451, 42 S. Ct. 363, 66 L. Ed. 708 (1922). In that case it was held that 
owing to the company's monopoly power, its lease-only system for distributing its complicated machinery was violative of the 
antitrust laws and that the company was obliged to offer to sell the machines outright as a precondition to leasing them.  The 
lower court noted ""United's power does not rest on predatory practices.  Probably few monopolies could produce a record so 
free from any taint of that kind of wrongdoing.  The violation with which United is now charged depends not on moral 
considerations, but on solely economic considerations."" 110 F. Supp. 295, 345 (D.C.Mass.1953). The parallel between United's 
control over its machinery and the telephone companies' control over their poles is quite clear.  Thus, we do not think the 
Commission selected an inappropriate remedy."
992,14," Petitioners argue additionally that the rules deprive them of the benefits of their local franchises.By this we do not understand 
them to mean that their franchise contracts have been unlawfully modified for it is well settled that contract rights in regulated 
industries are subject to reasonable modifications.  American Airlines, Inc. v. CAB, 123 U.S.App.D.C. 310, 359 F.2d 624 (1966), 
cert. denied 385 U.S. 843, 87 S. Ct. 73, 17 L. Ed. 2d 75; Air Lines Pilots Ass'n v. Quesada, 276 F.2d 892 (C.A.2, 1960).  Rather 
it appears to be the contention that the rules are an improper bypassing of local franchising authorities.  While we have serious 
reservations about the telephone companies' standing to represent the state and local interests concerned, we emphasize that 
properly construed the rules do not propose to regulate CATV systems as such, although one side effect of the rules is to 
remove from local consideration one category of CATV operations, i. e., by telephone company affiliates. Moreover, the rules are 
an implementation of national communications policy and thus, ipso facto, there is a legitimate basis for federal pre-emption.  
See Wire Mire: The FCC and CATV, 79 Harv.L.Rev. 366 (1965). We do not think that the the Commission has unlawfully 
interfered with the recognized role of local authorities. "
993,15," Petitioners suggest that they should have been granted a hearing.  We cannot agree.  HN29[
] The decision to proceed by 
rule-making rather than by ad hoc adjudication is one ""that lies primarily in the informed discretion of the administrative agency.  
SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 203, 67 S. Ct. 1575, 1760, 91 L. Ed. 1995 (1947). In rule-making there is no constitutional 
right to a hearing.  Alaska Steamship Co. v. FMC, 356 F.2d 59 (C.A.9, 1966).  Indeed the kind of issue before the Commission 
in this case was more readily susceptible to the rule-making mode rather than adjudication.  See 1 Davis, Administrative Law 
Sec. 7.02.  When, as here, a new policy is based upon the general characteristics of an industry, ""rational decision is not 
furthered by requiring the agency to lose itself in an excursion into detail that too often obscures fundamental issues rather than 
clarifies them."" WBEN, Inc. v. United States, 396 F.2d 601, 613 (C.A.2, 1968) cert. denied, King's Garden, Inc. v. FCC, 393 
U.S. 914, 89 S. Ct. 238, 21 L. Ed. 2d 200. The Commission was concerned primarily with the future development of broadband 
cable; that is the kind of issue where experience is worth a year of hearings.  See American Airlines, Inc. v. CAB, supra; Pacific 
Coast European Conference v. United States, supra."
993,16," Intervenor Lincoln asserts that the Commission should have grandfathered existing facilities.  However, had it done so, it 
would have been obliged to constantly supervise the grandfathered facilities in order to insure that abuses had not and would not 
develop.  It was precisely this sort of burdensome ad hoc administion that the Commission sought to avoid by promulgating 
prohibitory rules of general application.  If a telephone company can demonstrate that the operation of a CATV system by it or 
an affiliate in its service area would serve the public convenience and necessity, the new rules provide for waiver of the 
prohibition.  (Secs. 63.55 and 64.602.  The Commission is obliged to give full consideration to meritorious applications.  WAIT 
Radio v. FCC, 135 U.S.App.D.C. 317, 418 F.2d 1153 (1969); but see United States v. Storer Broadcasting Co., 351 U.S. 192, 76 
S. Ct. 763, 100 L. Ed. 1081 (1956); Federal Power Commission v. Texaco, 377 U.S. 33, 84 S. Ct. 1105, 12 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1964). 
We do not feel that where the Commission seeks to impose a regulatory policy it should be limited to building on the status quo. "
994,17," Petitioners contend that these rules represent a reversal of prior policy.  We cannot accept that interpretation.  The 
Commission has, of course, consistently recognized and encouraged the role of state and local governments in choosing who is 
to be a CATV operator, but it has not deviated from that position here.  While the rules have an indirect effect on local 
franchising power, they are simply the expression of a new policy with respect to CATV ownership in conformity with the 
developing standard of public convenience and necessity."
994,18," However, even where reliance is strong, regulations may be altered retroactively.  See Dixon v. United States, 381 U.S. 68, 85 
S. Ct. 1301, 14 L. Ed. 2d 223 (1964). Indeed very substantial reliance is sometimes disregarded.  See United States v. E. I. du 
Pont de Nemours, 353 U.S. 586, 77 S. Ct. 872, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1057 (1956) (Stock ownership in automobile manufacturer deemed 
violative of Sec. 7 Clayton Act despite nearly 40 years of acquiescence by Federal Trade Commission.) "
995,19," Intervenor Lincoln suggests that the rules are an abuse of discretion because they catch the innocent as well as the guilty.  
This overlooks the fact that the rules represent a policy choice, not a rectification of specific past evils.  That the guiltless may be 
affected by administrative regulation is too well settled to require further comment. See FCC v. WOKO, supra. "

the lower price they can make unrestricted use of it by paying the difference between that lower price and the consent-decree 
price."
1010,5," The problem under the Clayton Act is discussed infra, under Part VII, with respect to paragraph 31 of the amended answer.

Clayton Act.  The Government does not urge, with respect to that particular defense, that a case is made out by the pleadings 
and the now-admitted facts."
1011,7," Our analysis follows Blake & Pitofsky, Antitrust Law (1967), at 492-93. "
1012,8," The part of Judge Mansfield's opinion dealing with patent misuse is as follows: ""Since I would affirm the district court's decision, 
some reference should be made to the antitrust misuse defenses which the majority, because it reverses, did not reach.  These 
defenses strike me as not having any merit.  Assuming arguendo that the post-sale restrictions in Carter's 1956 agreement with 
Merck and its 1957 and 1959 agreements with Cyanamid, under which it sold meprobamate for use only in particular 
combination drugs, violated the antitrust laws when executed, which is a doubtful proposition at best, any illegality was 
eliminated by the 1962 Consent Decree. The latter obligated Carter to sell bulk meprobamate to all qualified pharmaceutical 
houses, including Cyanamid and Merck, at the maximum non-discriminatory price of $ 20 per pound (plus increases based on 
the Consumer Price Index) and the Cyanamid and Merck agreements were amended accordingly to permit rather than require 
that meprobamate be used in the combination drugs.  Thereafter Cyanamid and Merck, like some 100 other pharmaceutical 
houses which purchased bulk meprobamate from Carter (Sigerson Aff. p. 5), were free to buy bulk meprobamate and resell it 
without restraint.  The earlier agreements, as thus amended, were continued in effect only to permit Carter to continue charging 
those companies the lower prices theretofore specified in the agreements for meprobamate used in the combination drugs.  
There is no suggestion that others want the lower prices on the same basis for use in combination drugs, or that others would be 
refused such terms.  Thus any antitrust misuse has long since been purged or dissipated."" Judge Friendly, for himself and Judge Feinberg, found it unnecessary to reach or consider this question. "
1013,9," We are mindful, too, of the frequent sales by vendors (of all types) at lower prices to charitable organizations, ministers, 
teachers, etc., often with the implicit or express requirement that the item not be resold at a profit.  Cf. Singer Co. v. United 
States, post, at 90."

of the commissioner's opinion."

1043,15," With respect to claim 15, it was pointed out that the Milwaukee-Matic magazine rotates to locate a new tool at the tool change 
station while another tool is operating, whereas in the Morgan machine the empty slot in the magazine must remain in position to 
receive the previous tool while it is operating, and only after the operation is completed is it rotated to place the next tool in

1045,22, This interview apparently took place only a few days before Beall signed his employment agreement. 
1046,23," Defendant was granted a license under Morgan in May, 1960."
1046,24," In the conclusion of his 23-page opinion on September 29, 1962 (DTX 83), Beall stated: ""Claim 10 -- infringed but invalid."" Commenting on Beall's conclusion, plaintiff's counsel stated: ""We were particularly pleased to find that you confirmed our thinking that all of the claims except one are not infringed by 
the K&T structure and that the remaining claim is invalid in view of the prior art."" (DTX 84) The trial court sustained an attorney-client privilege objection to the admission of these documents.  The judge received similar 
communications between Beall and plaintiff's patent department counsel in evidence.  However, he apparently concluded that 
this exchange of letters between Beall and plaintiff's counsel related primarily to Morgan and that Morgan was not sufficiently 
material to the present litigation to justify rejection of the privilege.  We agree with the trial court's apparent conclusion that it 
would not be appropriate to protect material communications between Beall and plaintiff's patent department.  See Revised Draft 
of Proposed Rules of Evidence for the United States Courts and Magistrates (March 1971), proposed rule 503(d)(1).  This 
conclusion is applicable to communications relating to Morgan as well as Brainard in view of our analysis of the relationship 
between the two patents."
1046,25," The quotation is from DTX 93.  This is a memorandum prepared for plaintiff's executive officers by its patent department 
counsel.  It was prepared on March 18, 1963, and sent by counsel to Beall for his comments on March 22 (DTX 94).  Those 
comments are contained in DTX 95 dated March 28, 1963.  This series of documents was excluded on the same ground as DTX 
83 and 84.  We have considered them for reasons previously expressed.  See note 24, supra.  Apparently DTX 93 was excluded 
on the additional ground that it was essentially a communication between patent department counsel and plaintiff's officers.  We 
believe the request for Beall's comments vitiates the claim of privilege. "

value and bestowed them upon the patentee. In this respect the government and its officers are acting as the agents of the

1049,33," This argument is supported by Congress's rejection of proposed statutory language which would have made it improper for a 
former employee merely to ""aid or assist"" someone else in connection with a matter in which he had participated.  See 
""Memorandum of Attorney General Regarding Conflict of Interest Provisions of Public Law 87-849,"" 28 Fed. Reg. 985 (Feb. 1, 
1963) quoted at 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 1 through 370, pp. 282, 285. On the other hand, subsection (a) of § 207 covering action as an agent or attorney is clearly intended to prohibit a broader range 
of conduct than subsection (b) which refers to one who ""appears personally before any court or department as agent, or 
attorney. . . ."" See ibid."

1049,35," The second Brainard reissue application, also assigned to Division 13, was filed more than two years after Beall's retirement 
from the Patent Office. The application for the Morgan reissue was filed on January 17, 1964, within two years of Beall's retirement. Neither the original 
application nor the reissue application was assigned to Division 13.  However, Rule 341(g) also provided that ""Associated and 
related classes in other divisions may be required to be included in the [former examiner's] undertaking. . . ."" Beall's participation 
in connection with the Morgan reissue may therefore have conflicted with Patent Office policy. "

Brainard reissue dated March 2, 1965, was No. 25,812."
1050,37," ""If the mistake should be committed in the department of state, no one would say that it ought not to be corrected.  All would 
admit that a new patent, correcting the error, and which would secure to the patentee the benefits which the law intended to 
secure, ought to be issued.  And yet the act does not in terms authorize a new patent, even in this case.  Its emanation is not 
founded on the words of the law, but is indispensably necessary to the faithful execution of the solemn promise made by the 
United States.  Why should not the same step be taken for the same purpose, if the mistake has been innocently committed by 
the inventor himself?"" Grant v. Raymond, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 218, 242, 8 L. Ed. 376."
1050,38," ""Now, in our judgment, a patent for an invention cannot lawfully be reissued for the mere purpose of enlarging the claim, 
unless there has been a clear mistake inadvertently committed in the wording of the claim, and the application for a reissue is 
made within a reasonably short period after the original patent was granted.  The granting of such reissue after the lapse of long "
1051,," periods of time is an abuse of the power, and is founded on a total misconception of the law.  The Commissioner of Patents has 
evidently proceeded, in these cases, on the view that a patent may be reissued after any lapse of time, for the purpose of 
making a broader claim, by merely showing that the claim might have been broader than it was, and that it was inadvertently 
made too narrow at the time.  In this we think he has been entirely in error.  Lapse of time may be of small consequence on an 
application for the reissue of a patent on account of a defective specification or description, or where the original claim is too 
broad.  But there are substantial reasons, not applicable to these cases, why a claim cannot be enlarged and made broader after 
an undue lapse of time.  The rights of the public here intervene, which are totally inconsistent with such tardy reissues; and the 
great opportunity and temptation to commit fraud after any considerable lapse of time, when the circumstances of the original 
application have passed out of mind, and the monopoly has proved to be of great value, make it imperative on the courts as a 
dictate of justice and public policy, to hold the patentees strictly to the rule of reasonable diligence in making applications for this 
kind of reissues."" Mahn v. Harwood, 112 U.S. 354, 359-60, 28 L. Ed. 665, 5 S. Ct. 174."

when one solenoid is activated and into reverse when the second solenoid is activated.  (Tr. 1900-1902.) Thus, unlike the stern 
drive, a power failure will leave the outboard in forward gear. "
1069,6," Because stern drive units are sold to boat builders for installation in new boats, the exact cable length is known, enabling a 
cable of the proper length to be shipped with each unit."
1069,7," In summary the cable certificate program operates as follows: When O.M.C. sells its electric shift outboard engines, it provides through its Evinrude and Johnson engine divisions a 
certificate entitling the customer, at no further cost, to a control cable for the engine's throttle. The customer or dealer 
decides on the length of cable the boat requires and the engine dealer provides the customer with such a throttle control 
cable in exchange for the certificate. The certificates are then redeemed by the dealer, either singly or in accumulation, with 
an O.M.C. Gale division parts distributor for credit on cable purchases.  The parts distributor in turn accumulates certificates 
and redeems them with the Gale division for credit on cable purchases.  The Gale division returns the certificates to the 
Evinrude and Johnson engine division and charges the division involved a set price by means of an inter-divisional 
accounting transaction.  (Stip. Facts 29, 30.)"

1078,17," N.W. did draw up a list of parts needed for the manufacture of a hypothetical electric shift box. This was only done after one of 
O.M.C.'s interrogatories asked N.W. what it would cost to make such a hypothetical box. (Stip. Fact 73; Tr. 343.) "
1080,18," The Act makes it unlawful to ""combine or conspire"" to monopolize, but since there is no conspiracy issue involved in this case, 
the Court does not discuss this form of a Section 2 violation. "
1081,19," The cases in which monopoly power has been inferred involved companies possessing extremely large percentages of the 
market.  In United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416 (C.A. 2 1945), the defendant possessed 90% of the virgin 
aluminum market.  In United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778, 86 S. Ct. 1698 (1966), the defendant 
controlled 87% of the accredited central station protection services.  In American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 
90 L. Ed. 1575, 66 S. Ct. 1125 (1945), the appellant controlled over two-thirds of the entire field of domestic cigarettes and over 
80% of the special field of comparable cigarettes. In cases involving the control of smaller percentages of the market such 
inferences cannot be made.  Indeed, in United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, supra 148 U.S. at 424, J. Learned Hand 
stated that it was doubtful that 64% of the market would constitute a monopoly. And in United States v. United States Steel 
Corp., 251 U.S. 417, 64 L. Ed. 343, 40 S. Ct. 293 (1920) the defendant, although possessing nearly 50% of the market, was not 
held to have a monopoly even though it controlled much more of the market than did any one of its competitors. "
1083,20," O.M.C. initially ceased dealing with Teleflex, Inc., a supplier of cables, when that company began to compete with O.M.C. for 
the sale of O-style cables. This occurred some time during the fiscal year 1960-1961.  (Stip. Fact 12.)"
1083,21," The Court focuses on the untied market because any power to exclude competitors with respect to cables sold in the electric 
shift engine market was a function of O.M.C.'s power in the engine market not in the cable market.  It is in this market that N.W.'s 
President, Shontz, admitted that the company has been able to compete.  (Tr. 787-788.) It is in this market that O.M.C.'s 
monopoly power must be assessed."
1083,22," In 1968 O.M.C.'s total cable sales were 97,477.  The other 55,637 cables were used with O.M.C. electric shift engines."
1083,23," It is the percentage of the market O.M.C. possessed at the time it refused to deal with N.W. that is relevant to N.W.'s 
contention that the refusal to deal with N.W. was made when O.M.C. had monopoly power. At the time of O.M.C.'s first refusal to 
deal with N.W., O.M.C. controlled 68.09% of the cable market.  The Court does not believe, in light of the above facts, that that 
percentage of the market was sufficient from which monopoly power could be inferred.  The Supreme Court in U.S. v. Grinnell, 
384 U.S. 563, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778, 86 S. Ct. 1698 (1966), found that 87% of the accredited central station business was sufficient 
power from which monopoly could be found.  That Court, however, stated: ""The existence of such power ordinarily may be inferred from the predominant share of the market."" 384 U.S. at 571. The Court did not hold that a high percentage of the market must always indicate monopoly power. In this case the Court finds 
that the facts indicate that O.M.C. was not in possession of such power at the time it refused to deal with N.W.  Thus, the Court 
declines to infer a monopoly from the 68.09 per cent of the market O.M.C. possessed in 1961. "

1089,30," The stipulated formula is dependent on determining the number of cables that N.W. actually sold for use on new O.M.C.

per cable for cables sold to dealers in the outboard segment of the market.  (P.B. p. 157 -- Docket Item 158; D.B. p. 180 -- 
Docket Item 162.) "
1092,36," N.W. indicated its share of the market based on N.W.'s sale of M-style cables was 20 per cent for 1965 and 1966, 20.5 per

1099,2," We are aware of the controversy which surrounds the tying arrangement cases generally, a controversy involving differences 
over both economic policy (See, e.g. Markovitz, Tie-ins, Reciprocity, and the Leverage Theory, 76 Yale L.J. 1397 (1967); 
Bowman, Tying Arrangements and the Leverage Problem, 67 Yale L.J. 19 (1957); and the proper application of legal doctrine

1100,3," In Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting Co., Inc., et al., 368 U.S. 464, 473, 7 L. Ed. 2d 458, 82 S. Ct. 486 (1962), the Court in 
stating that summary procedures should be used sparingly in complex antitrust litigation used language which we think is of 
significance in determining the appropriateness of directing a verdict in this case rather than submitting the issues to a jury for 
evaluation: We look at the record on summary judgment in the light most favorable to Poller, the party opposing the motion, and 
conclude here that it should not have been granted.  We believe that summary procedures should be used sparingly in 
complex antitrust litigation where motive and intent play leading roles, the proof is largely in the hands of the alleged 
conspirators, and hostile witnesses thicken the plot.  It is only when the witnesses are present and subject to cross-
examination that their credibility and the weight to be given their testimony can be appraised.  Trial by affidavit is no 
substitute for trial by jury which so long has been the hallmark of ""even handed justice."" HN3[
] Although summary judgment and a directed verdict are procedurally distinguishable both substitute the court for the jury as the factfinder.  Some of the considerations dictating a reluctance to resort to summary judgment in complex antitrust cases 
are equally applicable to the direction of the verdict. "
1105,4," We have not undertaken in this opinion to discuss all of the items of evidence bearing upon the question of economic power.  
Plaintiff relies heavily, for example, upon evidence tending to indicate that the Credit Corporation was both able and willing to 
lend to high risk borrowers at a rate of interest commensurate with a much lower level of risk, i.e., to offer credit on terms 
otherwise unavailable at the time.  The guarantees and the Credit Corporation's relationship to U.S. Steel are pointed to as 
possible sources of leverage. Upon remand, these items and the entire range of evidence bearing upon this issue should be 
submitted to the jury.  Insofar as the complaints allege a per se violation due to a tie-in assuming that the evidence developed is 
substantially the same as that offered at the first trial, the trial judge may appropriately instruct the jury that the tie-in itself has 
been established as a matter of law, and that the amount of commerce affected is ""not insubstantial."" On this aspect of the case, 
the issue for the jury is whether the Credit Corporation, in the language of Northern Pacific Railway Co., et al. v. United States, 
supra, had ""sufficient economic power with respect to the tying product to appreciably restrain free competition in the market for 
the tied product . . . ."" Admittedly this is a standard which must vary in application from case to case, but the jury should be free 
to determine the issue on the basis of the entire evidence, (some of which we have commented upon) free from the limitations of 
an arbitrary definition. "
1106,1," On January 9, 1972, the action claiming a permanent injunction in the case here was withdrawn. Reporter of Judicial Decisions "
1112,*," Of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation. "
1114,1," See Austern, Dealing With Uncertainties in How to Comply With the Antitrust Laws 367-68 (Van Cise & Dunn, eds. 1954) (""By 
this time, perhaps, an abiding sympathy may have been enlisted for those lawyers who must advise in this field.  Even the most 
uncharitable should commiserate with the businessman who seeks to obtain definitive working rules for his daily operations."")"
1114,2," Despite our dissenting brother's suggestion that the ""target area"" standard is vague and confusing, we find it to possess the 
virtue of definiteness.  In simple terms a ""target"" is a person or business against which competitive aim is taken.  The line is 
clearly drawn by requiring that to have standing one must be an object of an antitrust conspiracy. In contrast, the ""foreseeability"" 
test urged by the dissent would permit anyone to sue, regardless of how distant his interest or relationship (including a customer 
of a competitor's customer, or a supplier to a supplier dealing with an alleged conspirator), since it would be difficult to disprove 
the fact that remote economic repercussions in the line of distribution result from almost every antitrust violation."
1114,3," We do not suggest that a non-operating theater lessor may never have standing to sue for treble damages under § 4 of the 
Clayton Act. If Calderone had alleged, for example, that the defendants had aimed their conspiracy at it, such as by agreeing to 
distribute and exhibit profitable pictures at theaters owned by the defendants or with which they had flat- lease arrangements, 
and not to distribute them to theaters with which they had percentage leases, Calderone would be in a different posture. "
1115,4," The dissent does not feel itself bound by the previous decisions of this Circuit mentioned above, because it views each of these 
decisions as distinguishable from the present case.  We fail to find any legal significance in the factual differences described at 
some length by Judge Levet.  Indeed, even the dissenting judges in two of the cases (SCM Corp. and Billy Baxter, Inc.) 
indicated that their disagreements centered upon not whether the precedents were factually distinguishable from the case before 
them, but whether a different test should be applied. Nor does the dissent provide any rationale in support of a differentiation based upon whether a plaintiff's relationship was with a 
victim of the conspiracy or with one in pari delicto.  Indeed, by denying standing in the latter situation in Fields Productions, 
Inc., supra, we failed to see the relevance of such a distinction.  Moreover, we do not agree that Calderone, rather than its 
lessee-exhibitor, is in an analogous situation to the television stations in Fields Productions, Inc., who were exhibitors of the 
motion pictures subjected to block booking."
1115,5," In addition, the test employed here is consistent with that of later Ninth Circuit decisions.  In Hoopes v. Union Oil Co. of 
California, 374 F.2d 480, 485 (9th Cir. 1967), and Mulvey v. Samuel Goldwyn Productions, 433 F.2d 1073, 1076 (9th Cir. 1970), 
the court found the plaintiff to be within the ""target area"" of the antitrust violation. "

""The Witness: He would pay more than that, particularly for a tow. . . . ""Q.  You mentioned that these rates were to -- what -- reimburse the contract station? . . . Is that supposed to cover their 
cost or to permit them to make a profit? ""A.  Well it doesn't -- frankly, it doesn't provide for them making much profit on what we actually pay for the service.  They 
feel their advantage is to represent us as a contract station. . . . ""Q.  And I suppose they could obtain repair work and automotive work on the basis of, say, doing some towing or providing 
some other type of service? ""A.  That is possible of course."" (Deposition of George J. Conway, Mgr. of Emergency Road Service Dept. CSAA, pp. 62-63.) "

said that he can hardly break even on a rate of this type.  It was explained that this is the rate we have with all our contract 
stations and that frankly, service stations and other smaller outlets are able to handle our calls with this rate.  Mr. Periat was 
told that the contract is not designed so that the stations will get rich just on emergency road service calls alone, but it is the 
business that is taken in by the shops that shows the profit.  It was added that any station that cannot show a profit by 
bringing in additional business from the contracts of 3-A members should perhaps not be affiliated with the Association.  No 
more was said by Mr. Periat about our rate."" (Memorandum of 9/19/68 from G. Nathan, Field Rep. Emergency Road Service Dept.)

1131,4," The record shows that in 1967, while CSAA might have paid only $3.50 to the Sunnyvale contract station for towing a 
member's automobile less than five miles, a non-member would have been charged $20, the standard fee charged by all 
Sunnyvale towing services -- including the one local contract station -- for normal towing. "
1137,1," Plaintiffs contend that the statute of limitations was tolled in 1954 when there was no federal statute of limitations, and that they 
are, therefore, entitled to the benefits of the Pennsylvania Statute of Limitations, which ran for six years. "
1139,2," Section 4B of the Clayton Act allows recovery for four years prior to the suspension of the statute of limitations. Plaintiffs' 
argument that a six-year period should be allowed, since this was the prevalent statute prior to the 1955 amendments setting a 
federal statute of four years is rejected; since as previously noted it is the 1955 amendment which tolls the statute they should 
also be bound by the period set forth in the 1955 amendment to the same statute. "

opinion leaves no doubt that it did not reverse the FTC order on the erroneous theory that such determinations might foreclose a 
contrary FTC § 5 decision.  We therefore put aside the Government's second question as irrelevant and focus on its first 
contention. "
1161,5," HN5[
] The Commission has described the factors it considers in determining whether a practice that is neither in violation of 
the antitrust laws nor deceptive is nonetheless unfair: ""(1) whether the practice, without necessarily having been previously considered unlawful, offends public policy as it has been 
established by statutes, the common law, or otherwise -- whether, in other words, it is within at least the penumbra of some 
common-law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness; (2) whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or 
unscrupulous; (3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers (or competitors or other businessmen)."" Statement of Basis 
and Purpose of Trade Regulation Rule 408, Unfair or Deceptive Advertising and Labeling of Cigarettes in Relation to the Health 
Hazards of Smoking.  29 Fed. Reg. 8355 (1964). S&H argues that a later portion of this statement commits the FTC to the view that misconduct in respect of the third of these 
criteria is not subject to constraint as ""unfair"" absent a concomitant showing of misconduct according to the first or second of 
these criteria.  But all the FTC said in the statement referred to was that ""the wide variety of decisions interpreting the elusive 
concept of unfairness at least makes clear that a method of selling violates Section 5 if it is exploitive or inequitable and if, in 
addition to being morally objectionable, it is seriously detrimental to consumers or others."" Ibid. (emphasis added). "
1162,6," The Commission did explicitly decline to assess S&H's conduct in light of one leading antitrust case.  In United States v. Arnold, 
Schwinn & Co., 388 U.S. 365, 379 (1967), this Court held that: ""Under the Sherman Act, it is unreasonable without more for a manufacturer to seek to restrict and confine areas or persons with 
whom an article may be traded after the manufacturer has parted with dominion over it.  White Motor [v. United States, 372 U.S. 
253 (1963)]; Dr. Miles [Medical Co. v. Park & Sons Co., 220 U.S. 373 (1911)]. Such restraints are so obviously destructive of 
competition that their mere existence is enough.  If the manufacturer parts with dominion over his product or transfers risk of loss 
to another, he may not reserve control over its destiny or the conditions of its resale."" Arguably, S&H's practice is proscribed by this doctrine.  When the FTC declined to rely on this precedent, however, it did so not 
to turn to considerations other than those embedded in the antitrust laws, but instead to look for considerations less ""technical"" 
and more deeply rooted in antitrust policy: ""We do not believe it appropriate to decide the broad competitive questions presented in this record on the narrow and technical 
basis of a restraint on alienation.  The circumstances here are much different from that where products are transferred to a 
dealer for resale.  They are complicated by the nature of the trading stamp scheme.  It is essential in this matter, we believe, and 
as we have heretofore indicated, to determine whether or not there has been or may be an impairment of competition.  Thus, we 
intend to look at the substance of the allegedly illegal practice rather than to decide the case by application of a technical 
formula."" 1 App. 175-176. "
1166,1," The appellees are Cab Employees, Automotive & Warehousemen, Local No. 881 (the Union), C.A. Christmas and Richard

Elizabeth Hospital, Inc. v. Richardson, 269 F.2d 167 (8th Cir. 1959)."
1168,3," The ""system"" maintained its stability by adhering to the terms of a contractual agreement between the taxicab operators and 
the Union.  Under this agreement, any cab company which produced in excess of a guaranteed minimum could place additional "

taxicab units."
1169,4," The strike-related violence occurred some two and one-half months after Yellow Cab filed its antitrust complaint.  Accordingly, it 
appears to be beyond the scope of the specific allegations raised in the pleadings.  In any event, there is no indication that the

1172,2," However, the jury in considering any loss of profits sustained by Plaintiff may not award damages for any profits Plaintiff may 
have lost from the sale of new or unused cars during the period involved.  This is because loss of profits may not be considered 
as an element of damages where the business from which they would have resulted was or would have been conducted in 
violation of the law.  In this connection, Oklahoma law provides that one must have a state license in order to sell new or unused 
cars as a dealer or salesman. The evidence is undisputed that Plaintiff had no such license during the period involved in this "
1173,," case, thus, could not lawfully sell or realize profits from the sale of new or unused cars.  The jury is further instructed as a matter 
of law that any efforts by Plaintiff to sell new or unused cars as a purchasing agent or buying service for others would be 
unlawful under Oklahoma law without the required state license and any loss of profits by selling new or unused cars by this 
method may not be considered by the jury in awarding damages.  (Record, pp. 2369-2370)."
1173,3," The court did not charge the jury that the refusal to deal is a violation of the antitrust laws if it is accompanied by a purpose to 
fix prices or restrain trade.  This is, of course, fundamental. "

The author suggests that official activity is requisite to the state action immunity doctrine. See also Note, ""State Action Exemption from the Antitrust Laws,"" 50 B.U. Law Rev. 393 (Summer 1970). This author also 
suggests that the state has to be directly and substantively involved in order for the exemption to apply. See Comment, ""Antitrust Immunity: Recent exceptions to the Noerr-Pennington Defense,"" 12 Boston College Ind. & Comm. Law 
Rev. 1133 (1971)."
1175,5," The argument that he did not actually sell new cars was considered by the trial court to be transparent.  We do not disagree 
with this."
1175,6," We mention this only in passing and not as a criticism or ruling on validity of the statute, but, rather, to point up the general 
nature of this state legislation. "
1176,," One of the stated purposes of the Oklahoma statute ( 47 O.S. § 561) is ""to foster and keep alive vigorous and healthy 
competition by prohibiting unfair practices by which fair and honest competition is destroyed and prevented,"" but the purpose is 
further declared to be ""to protect the public against the creation or perpetuation of monopolies and practices detrimental to the 
public welfare."" It defies logic to allow a conspiracy in restraint of trade to be immunized by allowing the conspirators to use the 
licensing provision of this regulatory system as a protective shield in a private action charging a conspiracy in restraint of trade."

Wrong and Private Action, 27 Harv. L. Rev. 317, 340-342 (1913). "
1177,8," * * * There is nothing in the language of the antitrust acts which indicates that Congress wanted to make the common-law in 
pari delicto doctrine a defense to treble-damage actions, and the facts of this case suggest no basis for applying such a doctrine 
even if it did exist.  Although in pari delicto literally means ""of equal fault,"" the doctrine has been applied, correctly or incorrectly, 
in a wide variety of situations in which a plaintiff seeking damages or equitable relief is himself involved in some of the same sort 
of wrongdoing.  We have often indicated the inappropriateness of invoking broad common-law barriers to relief where a private 
suit serves important public purposes.  Id. at 138."
1177,9," ""Both Simpson and Kiefer-Stewart were premised on a recognition that the purposes of the antitrust laws are best served by 
insuring that the private action will be an ever-present threat to deter anyone contemplating business behavior in violation of the 
antitrust laws. The plaintiff who reaps the reward of treble damages may be no less morally reprehensible than the defendant, 
but the law encourages his suit to further the overriding public policy in favor of competition.  A more fastidious regard for the 
relative moral worth of the parties would only result in seriously undermining the usefulness of the private action as a bulwark of 
antitrust enforcement.  And permitting the plaintiff to recover a windfall gain does not encourage continued violations by those in 
his position since they remain fully subject to civil and criminal penalties for their own illegal conduct.  Kiefer-Stewart, supra."" 392

1191,1," As we remarked in a previous antitrust appeal involving retail petroleum distribution, ""The line between a 'major' and a 'non-
major' oil company or 'independent' is not welldefined.  A major oil company is usually integrated in that it operates on the four 
functional levels of production, transportation, refining, and marketing.  Generally, a non-major does not own its refinery, or if it 
does, the refinery is usually small.  The non-major usually owns and operates its filling station."" Sun Oil Co. v. FTC, 1961, 294

1191,2," At the trial, Lehrman described his use of the TCA's during 1964 as follows: A. Well, during 1964 when the Save Station had come in, about, I would say, toward the latter part of the year, two or three 
different times, as the price was going down, if Gulf would support 26.9, I would post 24.9.  This would enable -- the Save would 
drop his down to 23, and the second call that I made to Gulf, I would tell them that he was 23, and they would authorize me to go 
to 24, and then I would put mine on 22, and then he would go to 21. Q. And what would happen when it went to 21? A. Well, he would -- I would have to call one more time to get it down to where Save would go to 20.9, and I ended up on 21.9 on 
my Gulftane gasoline. That was the lowest that -- Mr. Stokes said that was the lowest the Tyler District was authorized to go 
without a call to Houston, I believe. "
1192,3," Lehrman himself testified that after the conversation between Durst and Stokes he did not receive any more price support. 
Stokes, however, testified that Lehrman had continued to receive an allowance of.18 cents per gallon, even after Durst 
complained to Stokes about Lehrman's pricing policies.  The.18 cents per gallon was apparently in effect throughout the Tyler 
area.  Despite this qualification, Stokes did not deny that Gulf had severely restricted the amount and frequency of its TCA's to 
Lehrman in the wake of the Durst complaint.  Stokes was asked whether Durst's complaint concerned him. A.  Yes, it was of concern when he told me that, because I could see I had been giving away Gulf's money down there pretty 
regularly. Q.  Now what do you mean by that, sir? A.  Granting allowances that were too large.  I got to thinking about it."
1192,*, * * Q.  And so is that why you stopped granting the temporary competitive allowances that had previously been in effect for Mart? A.  What I stopped doing was granting allowances that would allow Lehrman a supported price of one cent above the self-serve.

to persuade the jury that the system was in fact used coercively towards him. "

Few business practices are anticompetitive on their face; whether or not such practices square with the antitrust laws often 
depends on how the practices are used in day-to-day business operations.  It is usually difficult for a court or a jury to cut 
through the rhetoric with which litigated business practices are described, and thereby to arrive at a reliable sense of the 
everyday significance of the practice in question.  The circumstances surrounding the use of a particular business practice give 
strong clues as to what those who employ the practice hope to accomplish by it, and what those individuals hope to accomplish 
may shed light on whether the practice does in fact have the hoped-for, but anti-competitive, effect.  In short, HN22[
] when a 
firm displays an anti-competitive animus in the operation of an otherwise ambiguous business practice, what the firm seeks to 
accomplish provides as sure an indicator of the actual effect of the practice on competition as can be found in the shifting sands 
of antitrust litigation. "

Switch (Hallsburg), Texas, which were located 8-9 miles from Mart, Texas."
1201,12," The colloquy is reported as follows in the official transcript: Q. Mr. Lehrman, were there Gulf Stations in Waco that were selling at a price below which you were selling during the period 
that you operated the station in Mart? MR. ERWIN: Your Honor, we object to that.  That goes directly to the question of whether or not there is price 
discrimination, and that has nothing to do with this case.  It is completely irrelevant to the issues here. MR. PRICE: It has to do with the price-fixing structure. MR. ERWIN: It doesn't have anything to do with the price that we sell to Mr. Lehrman, if they are not in competition with 
each other, and there is no allegation of price discrimination, and so it is completely irrelevant and immaterial. MR. PRICE: Your Honor, of course, we contend that they are in direct competition, and I think the evidence proves it.  I 
don't think there will be any to disprove it. MR. EDWARDS: Besides that, Your Honor, we have a stipulation with regard to the market area being confined solely to 
Mart, and that is in the pre-trial order, also . . . . THE COURT: Is there a stipulation that the market is limited to the Mart area? MR. PRICE: I have made no such stipulation, Your Honor. THE COURT: The objection is overruled. "
1202,13," Q.  Well, now, we started on the explanation of the pricing system but, first, let me ask you, has it been the same basically 
down in the Beaumont area when you worked there? A.  Now, what are you asking was the same? Q.  Whether the pricing system was basically the same, what you started to explain about support and assistance and so forth, 
has the basic system been the same during all of these years you have worked for Gulf in these different areas? A.  When I was in Beaumont I didn't know what the pricing system, as you call it, is, and I never had anything to do with pricing. Q.  Well, when you moved to Fort Worth in the 'fifties, since that time has it been basically the same? A.  To my knowledge, the tank wagon prices have remained relatively level, and we grant support in the same manner we have 
been doing for several years. Q.  And as far as you know, all of the areas in which you have had any personal knowledge or contact, it is basically the same, 
and still is today? A.  Now, what are you referring to now? Q.  This basic pricing system. A.  I don't know what you mean by the pricing system. You keep getting to this, but I am with you in saying I haven't seen any 
changes, but I still don't know what you mean -- Q.  By pricing system? A. -- by ""system."" Q.  Well, whatever the system is, and I am going to get into that in a little bit, in just a minute, Mr. Stokes, but it has remained 
basically the same, and it is basically the same throughout all areas that you have knowledge of? A.  Yes. "
1203,14," ""In determining the damages, if any, that the Plaintiff sustained as a result of a violation, if any, of the Antitrust Law, you are 
to be governed by the following instructions: The terms ""business"" and ""property,"" as used in the Antitrust Laws, signifies that which habitually busies or engages time, 
attention or labor as a principal serious concern or interest.  Our law permits the jury to take into account both any damages 
which may have been inflicted on existing property and the damages which may have been sustained as a result of being unable 
to make profit which reasonably could have been anticipated and would have been realized if it were not for the violation of the 
Antitrust Laws, if any such violation occurred.  But you are instructed that it must first be determined that any conspiracy which 
may or may not have existed was a substantial, identifiable cause of the damage, if any, to the Plaintiff. In a suit alleging a violation of the Antitrust Laws, in order for the Plaintiff to recover, he must prove that the violation was an 
identifiable, direct and substantial cause of the damage which he sustained.  The Plaintiff then must satisfy you that the damage, 
if any, which he suffered, was as a fact attributable to the conspiracy, if any there existed.  But while the Plaintiff has the burden 
of showing that any damage which he may have sustained was the result of the violation, he would not have to prove with exact 
mechanical accuracy the extent of the damages; however, the damages alleged must be established by a preponderance of the 
evidence as a direct and identifiable result of a violation of the Antitrust Laws. In other words, the Plaintiff must satisfy you that 
the damages, if any, would not have occurred but for the violation, if any. In this case you are instructed that you cannot award any damages, if any, that may have occurred prior to March 1, 1964. In considering the element of future profits in determining what damages, if any, were sustained by Plaintiff, you are instructed 
that if because of a conspiracy the Plaintiff was unable to earn net profits which would in reasonable probability have accrued to 
him but for the conspiracy, then, Plaintiff was in fact damaged.  Future profits mean net profits, and are determined by 
subtracting the cost and expense of a business from its gross revenue. You are instructed that you may consider in determining whether or not any part of Plaintiff's damages constitute future net 
profits the past history and net profits of the business, the experience and competence of the plaintiffs in the filling station 
business, the competition which the Plaintiff would have had in and around Mart, Texas, and the general market conditions in 
that area.  You may not base any findings of damages on sheer guesswork, but must make a just and reasonable estimate of 
damage based on the relevant evidence."""

year.  The evidence showed that the actual tenure -- and if I am wrong about this, you gentlemen correct me -- the actual time "
