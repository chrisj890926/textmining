32,3," Microsoft disputes plaintiffs' definition of the ""relevant markets"" and their allegations of Microsoft's power within those markets. 
Microsoft recognizes, however, that these issues are ""sharply disputed by the parties"" and are ""typically resolved in a battle 
among expert economists"" at trial. See Def.'s Mem. in Opp'n to Pls.' Mots. for Prelim. Inj. at 2, 3. Microsoft concedes that, for

35,10," In Jefferson Parish, four concurring Justices would have abandoned the per se rule.  466 U.S. at 32. "
36,11," Plaintiffs rely on the Declaration of Edward W. Felten, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Princeton University, for the 
proposition that Web browsing functionality can be removed from Windows 98 without damaging the underlying operating 
system. Whether Dr. Felten's ""mechanism,"" see Felten Decl. P 7, actually removes the ""browser,"" or merely removes code that 
""looks more like a key to opening IE than anything that could plausibly be considered IE itself,"" Microsoft, 147 F.3d at 952 n.17, 
remains to be seen. "
37,12," That court went on to state that, even had IBM not offered the products separately, there would be no unlawful tie because the 
items were part of a single product.  Innovation Data Processing, 585 F. Supp. at 1476. Following Jefferson Parish, however, the 
court revisited its decision, emphasizing that the basis for its original decision was the finding of no coercion, and declining to 
reach the ""separate product"" question. See Innovation Data Processing v. IBM, 603 F. Supp. 646, 648-49 (D.N.J. 1984)."
37,13," Plaintiffs also distinguish the ILC case. There, the court found that the drive unit and head/disk assembly were a single product 
because: they were designed to be and would be used as a unit; the aggregation offered dramatically larger online storage 
capacity; the aggregation satisfied a recognized customer need; the aggregation resulted in cost savings that were passed on, at 
least in part, to end users; the drive unit and head/drive assembly were normally used in fixed proportions; and the practice of 
other industry participants was to sell the integrated product at a single price. See ILC 448 F. Supp. at 232-34. In contrast, 
plaintiffs contend, operating systems and browsers are not used in fixed proportions. Despite the D.C. Circuit's assumption to the 
contrary, see Microsoft, 147 F.3d at 948, plaintiffs contend that some users prefer to use as many as three separate browsers 
while others prefer none at all. Furthermore, plaintiffs argue, not all sellers bundle the products together; no consumer savings 
have been shown to result from the bundling; and not even Microsoft claims that the benefits of bundling Windows and IE are 
""dramatic."""
37,14," In fact, in Jefferson Parish, the Supreme Court implicitly rejected Microsoft's argument that the Court's analysis was limited to 
integrated packages of services. See Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 19 n.30 (""We have often found HN6[
] arrangements 
involving functionally linked products at least one of which is useless without the other to be prohibited tying devices."")

45,21," Microsoft also argues that since it has unilaterally waived the challenged provisions of its ISP and ICP agreements, the claims 
related to those agreements are moot. But HN16[
] the Court retains jurisdiction to consider even the ""waived"" practices if they 
caused anticompetitive effects. See Northwest Envtl. Defense Ctr. v. Gordon, 849 F.2d 1241, 1245 (9th Cir. 1988) (""The fact that 
the alleged violation has itself ceased is not sufficient to render a case moot. As long as effective relief may still be available to 
counteract the effects of the violation, the controversy remains live and present.""). ""Voluntary cessation of allegedly illegal 
conduct"" does ""not make the case moot."" United States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 632, 97 L. Ed. 1303, 73 S. Ct. 894

54,1," On July 10, 1998, and on September 10, 1998, the defendants filed motions for Leave of Court to Submit Supplemental 
Authority. Those motions are each granted. The court has reviewed and considered the decisions referenced in the defendants' 
motions and the plaintiffs' response to the July 20, 1998, motion. These decisions are Massachusetts Laborers' Health & 
Welfare Fund v. Philip Morris Incorporated, No. 97-CV-11552-GAO, slip op. (D. Mass. June 19, 1998); Eastern States

54,2," The Wisconsin distributor defendants did not join in the filing of the original notice of removal. However, they subsequently filed 
a document indicating that they consented to and joined in the notice of removal of this action in the United States District Court

54,3," The distributor defendants are National Tobacco Co., Inc. and Gerald F. Krause Enterprises, Ltd. d/b/a Friedman Tobacco and 
Company Co."
54,4," This grounds has been rendered moot by the distributor defendants having now consented to, and joined in, the notice of 
removal. "
60,5," Of course, whether the plaintiffs have standing to bring such claims is a separate question. It is enough to say, however, that in 
order to resolve that question there is no need to interpret the contract and the rights it affords as between the fund fiduciaries, 
participants, and beneficiaries under the plan. "

62,8," Most of the text of Count VI is not contained in the plaintiffs' complaint in this action. Indeed, it is for this reason that the 
plaintiffs filed a motion for dismissal without prejudice. It is also the reason for the plaintiffs' refiling this action in state court to 
include the missing pages. That second action was thereafter removed to this court and assigned case number 98-C-0394. "
63,9," I am also satisfied that the plaintiffs' complaint, as to the distributor defendants, complies with the pleading requirements of § 
802.03(2), Wis. Stat. That section, like Rule 9(b), Fed. R. Civ. P. states: ""In all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances 
constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other condition of mind of a person 
may be averred generally."""
63,10," The defendants argue that the plaintiffs have failed to plead the various elements of fraud, particularly the distributors' 
supposed intent to induce the Funds' reliance. However, in order to prove a violation of § 100.18(1), Wis. Stat., it is not "
64,," necessary that the plaintiff prove intent to defraud. There are only two elements to a violation of § 100.18(1), Wis. Stat.: (1) the 
existence of an advertisement or announcement and (2) that such advertisement contains an assertion, representation or 
statement of fact which is ""untrue, deceptive, or misleading."" American TV, supra. "
77,1," PT24 also has an agreement with Fox's wholly-owned subsidiaries, Fox-Net, Inc. and Fox Television Stations, Inc., pursuant to 
which PT24 pays a fee in exchange for a license to distribute Fox Network programming to its customers in unserved 
households. (Compl. P 35). "
78,2," PT24 also wrote to Fox, seeking to amend their agreement to eliminate the ""unserved household"" limitation in exchange for a 
fee."
78,3," See 5/12/98 Order in CBS Inc. v. PrimeTime 24 Joint Venture, 96-3650-Civ-Nesbitt. "
82,4," As noted above, at the time of PT24's second attempt to negotiate, in February 1997, at least one law suit had been filed 
against it. See Defs.' Mem. Of Law at 10 n.8. "
83,5," Because the Court finds defendants' conduct to be immune from antitrust liability under the Noerr doctrine, it does not address 
defendants' further arguments that plaintiff has failed adequately to plead adverse effect on competition or antitrust injury. "

93,5," Physically speaking this is impossible. North Star's proposals rely on a legal fiction: the contract path. This fiction assumes that 
the electricity delivered to a particular customer passes directly to the customer from a designated power generation facility only 
along certain power lines. See Lee A. Rau, Open Access in the Power Industry: Competition, Cooperation, and Policy 
Dilemmas, 64 Antitrust L.J. 279, 286 (1996); David J. Rosso, Transmission Access--A Crucial Issue for an Industry, 123 Pub. 
Util. Fort., Feb. 16, 1989, at 18, 20. Electricity, however, follows the path of least resistance through a circuit, which is not 
necessarily the path negotiated in a contract. No utility company can control which particular electron travels to any end-user, 
unless the end-user is the only power consumer on the circuit."

96,9," At the time of the Fifth Circuit's decision the legislative policy statement for the telecommunications industry provided: It is the policy of this state to protect the public interest in having adequate and efficient telecommunications service 
available to all citizens of the state at just, fair, and reasonable rates. The legislature finds that the telecommunications 
industry through technical advancements, federal judicial and administrative actions, and the formulation of new 
telecommunications enterprises has become and will continue to be in many and growing areas a competitive industry 
which does not lend itself to traditional public utility regulatory rules, policies, and principles; and that therefore, the public 
interest requires that new rules, policies, and principles be formulated and applied to protect the public interest and to 
provide equal opportunity to all telecommunications utilities in a competitive marketplace. It is the purpose of this section to 
grant to the [PUC] the authority and the power under this Act to carry out the public policy herein stated. Act effective Sept. 1, 1975, 64th Leg., R.S., ch. 721, § 18(a), 1975 Tex. Gen. Laws 2327 (amended 1995) (current version at 
Tex. Util. Code Ann. § 51.001 (Vernon 1998))."
96,10," North Star's argument relies on a questionable economic theory that the electric power industry is actually composed of three 
separate product markets: the markets for power generation, power transmission, and power distribution. This theory ignores 
fundamental laws of physics. Electric generators produce no electrical power unless connected to a completed electrical circuit. 
Power transmission and distribution lines serve no function unless the lines carry an electric current. So it is questionable 
whether the three product ""markets"" are in fact separate given that their products do not exist independently. See 10 Phillip E. 
Areeda, et al., Antitrust Law PP 1743a-1750 (1996) (synthesizing an analytical regime for determining whether bundled items 
or services constitute one product or multiple products for the purposes of evaluating an antitrust tying claim); But see, e.g., 
Town of Massena v. Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9382, 1980-2 Trade Cas. (CCH) P63,526, 1980 WL 
1889 (N.D.N.Y. Sept. 8, 1980) (adopting the three-product-market theory for the electric power industry). However, because the 
court concludes that Texas's regulatory policy includes regulation of power generation (both wholesale and retail), it is 
unnecessary to identify relevant product markets at this time or to decide whether electric power generation is a separate 
product market."

97,12," This language is very similar to the statutory statement of policy towards the telecommunications industry in effect at the time 
of the DFW Metro Line decision. See supra note 9."
97,13," Moreover, a brief examination of chapter 35 demonstrates that Texas has not eliminated regulation of the wholesale 
generation industry, but instead has simply established a different set of regulations for that industry. Chapter 35 allows a 
""provider of generation"" to compete for power sales, and it allows electric utilities to purchase power. See Tex. Util. Code Ann. 
§§ 35.002, 35.003(a) (Vernon 1998). Section 35.004(a) requires that owners of transmission facilities provide wholesale 
transmission service at rates comparable to its own internal costs. However, the PUC still maintains regulatory oversight of the 
system. See id. §§ 35.004(b)-(c), .005-.007. Ultimately, the PUC and not the market determines whether a utility's conduct is 
economically reasonable. See id. § 35.005(a). And the statute still requires that the PUC adopt rules to govern the wholesale 
transmission of electricity. See id. § 35.006(a). The state of Texas has thus adopted a clear and affirmative policy to regulate 
wholesale power generation. "

foreign country, before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent, . . . "

119,4," This section is the dissenting opinion of Judge Newman. The court affirms the judgment of invalidity for violation of the on-sale 
bar, in separate opinions of Chief Judge Mayer and Judge Bryson. "
122,5," The three different views in the three opinions of this panel on the on-sale issue point up the need for a more certain law than 
today exists. Inventors and those who commercialize inventions should reasonably know when the on-sale bar starts to accrue, 
instead of awaiting litigation-borne post hoc judicial evaluations of the totality of the circumstances, varying with the nature of the 
invention, the nature of the customer contact, and the judicial weight given to the conflicting policy interests. I favor, as simple and fair, the bright line rule that for the § 102(b) on-sale bar to accrue the invention must exist in commercial 
form when the offer of sale is made. This rule would implement the dominant policy of providing a one-year grace period for 
determining the performance of the product in the marketplace. "
129,6," The record provided us does not show any response from the PTO. Although Bard states that ""the [PTO] determined that the

130,7," In Nobelpharma the Federal Circuit held in banc that Federal Circuit law would thenceforth apply to determination of whether 
fraudulent conduct occurred in obtaining a patent, whereas determination of the other elements of the section 2 violation, viz. 
market power in the relevant market and illegal restraints on competition, since not unique to the patent right would continue to 
be governed by regional circuit law.  141 F.3d at 1067-68, 46 U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) at 1104. "

cites to PP6 & 11 are to the jury's finding of patent misuse, and the jury instructions at A10096 concern the duty of candor to the 
PTO. The source of the quoted ""actual knowledge"" is not given. Such misdirections are not helpful to the appellate tribunal; see 
also note 6, supra."
132,9," The court has affirmed the district court's judgment of antitrust violation on this ground; see the separate opinion of Judge 
Bryson, joined by Chief Judge Mayer. This section contains the dissenting opinion of Judge Newman. "
139,10," Reliance on Engstrom's trial testimony is inherently less reliable than contemporaneous documentary evidence. Cf.  TP Lab., 
Inc. v. Professional Positioners, Inc., 724 F.2d 965, 972, 220 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 577, 583 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (inventor's expressions 
of ""subjective intent . . . particularly after institution of litigation, is generally of minimal value""). "
149,1," This case is cited by different abbreviations -- ""Queen City"" or ""Domino's""--in various other cases and in the academic 
literature. This Report and Recommendation shall refer to it as ""Queen City"" because of the common practice of using the 
plaintiff's name to identify a case when that name is not such a common litigant as to make it an unuseful identifier. I also note 
that the Areeda and Hovenkamp treatise chooses to refer to the case as Queen City and not Domino's. AREEDA & 
HOVENKAMP, ANTITRUST LAW (Supp. 1998)."
149,2," Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 (1984) (a 30% market share was not 
sufficient to constitute market power for purposes of a tie-in). "
150,3," Because I have recommended dismissal of the class action tie-in claims on alternate grounds, if that March 31, 1998, Report 
and Recommendation is accepted by the Court, this Report and Recommendation will be of significance solely to the antitrust 
claims set out in the Andrzejek case and Gary Smith plaintiffs individual antitrust tying claim."
150,4," The only food product that Domino's Pizza actually manufactured was fresh dough. Its franchisees were permitted to make 
their own dough, but if they did so they could not sell it to other franchisees, even though they would allegedly have sold it at 
25% to 40% below Domino's prices. Additionally, plaintiff's allege that Domino's refused to sell fresh dough to franchisees unless 
the franchisees purchased the other ingredients and supplies from Domino's Pizza, which supplies Domino's acquired from other 
manufacturers. Plaintiffs allege that each store paid between $ 3,000 and $ 10,000 more per year for ingredients and supplies 
due to these anti-competitive measures."
150,5," Quoting Brown Shoe, Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510, 82 S. Ct. 1502 (1962), the Third Circuit noted that, 
""the outer boundaries of product market are determined by the reasonable interchangeability of use or the cross-elasticity of 
demand between the product itself and substitutes for it."" Queen City, 124 F.3d 430 at 436."
150,6, Nor can I find it in the published district court opinion. 
151,7," A more correct statement would be either available in the current market, or could be made readily available by new market 
entrants who would be provided information and permission by Domino's as to the specifications needed for the ingredients 
used by Domino's franchises, and permission to use any Domino's logos or trademarks that were affixed to any of the products, 
such as paper goods and packaging. "
152,8," Judge Lay was technically incorrect. It was not Virtual Maintenance that could provide a suitable substitute software package if 
Ford Motor Company agreed to use it. It appears that Virtual only provided maintenance services for computers. Rather it was 
other competitors of Prime Computer that could have provided suitable surrogate software packages if Ford would have allowed 
the use of these software packages. "
154,9," Plaintiffs asserted an alternate theory that the amenity products were the ""tying goods,"" and the HFS logo was the ""tied 
product."""
154,10," In Valley Products, the Sixth Circuit noted that this quarter century old precedent was questioned in the recent Areeda and 
Hovenkamp antitrust treatise supplement as being ""one of a group of older cases that no longer constitutes 'reliable guides in a 
tying area. Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 511.1 (Supp. 1992)."" Valley Products, 128 F.3d at 405. 
The Sixth Circuit noted the difference between patents and trademarks, noting that a patented product was ""necessarily unique,"" 
whereas a trademark was not. It also questioned whether the Chicken Delight case was still viable precedence in light of Mozart 
Co. v. Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc., 833 F.2d 1342, 1346 (9th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 870, 102 L. Ed. 2d 
148, 109 S. Ct. 179 (1988), where the court held that a prestigious trademark of an automobile was not persuasive evidence of "
155,," economic power necessary to constitute a tying product for application of the per se antitrust rules against tie-ins. Valley 
Products, 128 F.3d at 405."
155,11," Judge Becker noted that ""the amount of commerce that the franchisors are foreclosing in the tied product market -- for pizza 
sauce, flour and other supplies (for which non-franchisor dominated suppliers, be they individual firms or a franchise 
cooperative, could easily meet quality controlled specifications) is enormous.  Queen City Pizza, Inc. v. Domino's Pizza, Inc., 129 
F.3d 724, 726 (6th Cir. 1997)(statement concerning the denial of rehearing en banc.)."
155,12," The majority in Queen City believed that the uniqueness of the property had to come from the nature of the product itself and 
not from the franchise agreement. Queen City, 124 F.3d 430 at 435-36. "
156,13, Plaintiffs do challenge the good faith of Little Caesar with regard to the approval of these three alternate distributors. 
159,14," The Collins court found that there was ""a lack of interchangeability or cross-elasticity of demand between approved Dairy 
Queen products and similar non-approved products."" Yet, that non-interchangeability is a product of the franchise contract and 
not one that would have resulted from ordinary market forces in the absence of the franchise contract. "
168,1," FirstBank's motion for summary judgment is directed toward Norte Car's claims. It does not discuss the claims of the other 
plaintiffs. While those claims may be subject to a similar dismissal, they were not the subject of Firstbank's motions, and are not 
addressed herein."
168,2," Consideration of these motions for summary judgment does not foreclose the possibility that the Court will entertain another 
motion for summary judgment later in these proceedings. "
169,3, The complaint against Baldrich Associates has been dismissed. 
170,4," The Court does not determine whether a heightened evidentiary standard should be applied in this action. As is explained 
below, the pleadings are deficient and insufficient; hence, the evidence in this action need not be evaluated except for the floor 
plan agreeing."
170,5, This defense again raises the Court's question as to exactly which party in the underlying transactions required insurance. 
171,6," An excellent comprehensive discussions on the general principles of antitrust law may be found in J.O. von Kalinowski, 
Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulation (2d ed. 1998), and P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law (1989)."
171,7," Norte Car vaguely suggests that the relevant market is the market for services related to the sales of low-value (less that $ 
10,000) cars in Puerto Rico. The Court makes no determination that this definition of a market comes anywhere near the 
precision needed for a the antitrust definition of market, except to point out that none of the facts alleged support a finding that 
FirstBank is involved in any market beyond the financial and banking markets. "
173,8," A private litigant may not bring an action for treble damages under the Robinson-Patman Act because this is not one of the 
""antitrust laws"" recognized by the Clayton Act as granting a private right of action for treble damages. See Nashville Milk Co. v. 
Carnation Co., 355 U.S. 373, 375-76, 78 S. Ct. 352, 2 L. Ed. 2d 340 (1958). However, an act that violates the Robinson-Patman 
Act may also violate Section 2 of the Clayton Act, which does allow a private right of action."
173,9," Norte Car's claim that FirstBank's commissions for the referral of retail paper cannot allege a price discrimination claim 
because Norte Car does not argue that FirstBank paid its own customers different rates of commission, only that FirstBank's 
rates were lower than those paid by other area banks. See AA Poultry Farms, Inc. v. Rose Acre Farms, 881 F.2d 1396, 1399 
(7th Cir. 1989) (Easterbrook, J.)."
173,10," Norte Car emphasizes that some of the injuries alleged are secondary-line injuries. In secondary-line injury cases, a plaintiff 
needs only to show injury to a competitor, not to competition. The secondary-line analysis advocated by Norte Car is only 
appropriate for Clayton Act and Robinson-Patman Act claims, which are not applicable here, as stated above. See Coastal Fuels 
of P.R. v. Caribbean Petroleum Corp., 79 F.3d 182, 191-92 (1st Cir. 1996). "
174,11," FirstBank argues that the necessary ""concerted action"" is not alleged such that FirstBank has violated Section One of the 
Sherman Act. The Supreme Court, however, has affirmed a Ninth Circuit case which found that a tying arrangement forced upon 
a customer satisfies the concerted action requirement of Section One.  Image Tech. Serv., Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 903 F.2d 
612, 619 (9th Cir. 1990), aff'd, 504 U.S. 451, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992)."
174,12," It should be noted that as to this first kind of tying claim, Plaintiffs failed to allege in its complaint that they actually ever bought 
the tied products. Circuit courts are divided as to whether a person may be held liable for a tying violation if the buyer never 
actually buys the tied product. Antitrust Law, § 22.02[3]."
174,13," The party who claims direct damages here is a third party insurance broker with ties to Norte Car. She claims that she should 
have had the business that FirstBank required Norte Car to direct to its designees. There are no motions pending with regard to 
this Plaintiff. "
175,14, Some of these arrangements may also be subject to a rule of reason analysis. 
178,15," In making such an evaluation, Plaintiff's counsel is reminded to consider Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. By 
presenting a signed complaint to the Court, the attorney is certifying ""that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and 
belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances"" . . . ""(2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions 
therein are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or 
the establishment of new law; . . ."" Fed.R. Civ.P. 11(b). "
189,*," The Honorable Frederick J. Scullin, Jr., of the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, sitting by 
designation. "
191,1," It is unclear, based on the record, precisely whether it is necessary that an individual have a phone service account in France 
or whether one need only have a France Telecom S.A. calling card account and the necessary hardware. "
192,2, The record does not indicate the derivation of this term.
192,3," Filetech has programmed its computers to take advantage of the three free minutes feature by switching its computers on and 
off at three-minute intervals until the entire electronic directory has been copied. "
193,4," We rely primarily on the affidavits describing this litigation that were submitted by France Telecom and credited by the district 
court. "
194,5," The motion was filed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) generally. France Telecom failed to specify the subsection of Rule 12(b) under 
which it was moving. See Filetech S.A.R.L. v. France Telecom, 978 F. Supp. 464, 472 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. 1997)."
194,6," The Ninth Circuit has defined these factors as follows: The degree of conflict with foreign law or policy, the nationality or allegiance of the parties and the locations or principal places of 
business of corporations, the extent to which enforcement by either state can be expected to achieve compliance, the relative 
significance of effects on the United States as compared with those elsewhere, the extent to which there is explicit purpose to 
harm or affect American commerce, the foreseeability of such effect, and the relative importance to the violations charged of 
conduct within the United States as compared with conduct abroad. Metro Indus. v. Sammi Corp., 82 F.3d 839, 846 (9th Cir. 1996) (quotation omitted). "
231,1," The 1980 amendments to Wis. Stat. Chapter 133 went into effect on May 8, 1980 -- before decisions were issued in Grams and 
in Independent Milk Products Co-op v. Stoffel, 102 Wis. 2d 1, 6-7, 298 N.W.2d 102 (Ct. App. 1980), a case citing similar 
precedent on interstate/intrastate transactions. However, both of these cases addressed conduct governed by pre-amendment 
antitrust law and thus do not provide direct guidance on the significance of the 1980 changes."
231,2," Federal statutes establish a four-year statute of limitations for private antitrust actions. 15 U.S.C. § 15b. Illinois Brick Co. v. 
Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707, 97 S. Ct. 2061 (1977), held that indirect purchasers were not entitled to recover treble 
damages under § 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15(a), for price-fixing in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1. "
232,3," This section was condensed and otherwise reworded and renumbered in 1980. Previously, HN3[
] the section read in part: (1) Every contract or combination in the nature of a trust or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce is hereby declared 
illegal. Every combination, conspiracy, trust, pool, agreement or contract intended to restrain or prevent competition in the 
supply or price of any article or commodity in general use in this state, to be produced or sold therein, or constituting a 
subject of trade or commerce therein, or which combination, conspiracy, trust, pool, agreement or contract shall in any 
manner control the price or any such article or commodity, fix the price thereof, limit or fix the amount or quantity thereof to 
be manufactured, mined, produced or sold in this state, or fix any price or figure in which its price to the public shall be in 
any manner controlled or established, is hereby declared an illegal restraint of trade. Every person, corporation, 
copartnership, trustee or association who shall either as principal or agent become a party to any contract, combination, 
conspiracy, trust, pool or agreement herein declared unlawful or declared to be in restraint of trade, or who shall combine or 
conspire with any other person, corporation, copartnership, association or trustee to monopolize or attempt to monopolize 
any part of the trade or commerce in this state shall forfeit for each such offense not less than $ 100 nor more than $ 5,000. 
Any such person, corporation, copartnership, trustee or association shall also be liable to any person transacting or doing 
business in this state for threefold the damages he may sustain by reason of the doing of anything forbidden by this section, 
and the cost of suit including a reasonable attorney's fee. As used in this section, the words ""article or commodity in general 
use in this state"" includes newspapers, magazines, periodicals, and advertising, including radio advertising…. Wis. Stat. § 133.01(1) (1977) (emphasis added). After 1980, HN4[
] the comparable section reads: (1) Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce is illegal. 
Every person who makes any contract or engages in any combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce may 
be fined not more than $ 100,000 if a corporation, or, if any other person, $ 50,000, or be imprisoned for not more than 5 
years, or both. (2) Every person who monopolizes, or attempts to monopolize, or combines or conspires with any other person or persons 
to monopolize any part of trade or commerce may be fined not more than $ 100,000 if a corporation, or, if any other person, 
$ 50,000, or be imprisoned for not more than 5 years, or both. Wis. Stat. § 133.03 (1998). "
233,4," Section 1 of the Sherman Act begins: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint 
of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1 
(emphasis added)."
233,5," Plaintiff cites a persuasive example of this type of suit in Wisconsin-- Carlson v. Abbott Labs., No. 94CV002608, Milwaukee 
County Circuit Court--an indirect purchaser class action brought by Wisconsin retail purchasers and consumers of infant baby 
formula. The Carlson plaintiffs claimed injuries from a wholesale price-fixing conspiracy extending beyond this state. In an 
unpublished oral decision denying summary judgment to defendant manufacturers, Circuit Court Judge William J. Haese noted: Wisconsin's legislature has created an additional category of plaintiff who can recover under the state antitrust law but 
who cannot recover under federal law. The legislature has also eliminated the language applying the statute to illegal 
conduct in this state. The legislature added the ability for indirect or retail purchasers to pursue their damages under the 
antitrust chapter pursuant to 133.18. I find no evidence that the legislature intended to limit recovery for indirectly injured 
Wisconsin citizens to prohibited conspiracies occurring solely within the borders of Wisconsin. To the contrary, I find an 
emphatic attempt to promote competition and punish conduct such as been alleged in this case. Carlson v. Abbott Labs., No. 94CV002608 (Milwaukee County Cir.Ct. Feb. 27, 1995) (Tr. of Mot. Hr'g at 16). "
234,6," A recent Alabama Supreme Court case recounts this history, confirming that a decisive factor in most early state antitrust cases 
was the Supreme Court's prevailing ""dual sovereignty"" theory. This theory set forth distinct and mutually exclusive zones of 
jurisdiction for the states and the federal government. See generally Abbott Labs. v. Durrett,     Ala.    ,    , 1998 Ala. LEXIS 208, 
1998 WL 436062, * 14-*17 (July 31, 1998); Lawrence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law § 5-4, 307-08 (2d ed. 1988) (noting 
the consistent dichotomy between interstate and intrastate commerce in Supreme Court jurisprudence prior to the New Deal). "
235,7," The Supreme Court has upheld the application of specific state antitrust statutes which clearly affect interstate commerce. See, 
e.g., California v. ARC America Corp., 490 U.S. 93, 104 L. Ed. 2d 86, 109 S. Ct. 1661 (1989); Watson v. Buck, 313 U.S. 387, 85 
L. Ed. 1416, 61 S. Ct. 962 (1941). See also Heath Consultants, Inc. v. Precision Instruments, Inc., 247 Neb. 267, 527 N.W.2d 
596, 606-07 (Neb. 1995) (citing state and federal cases concluding that the Constitution and federal law do not bar application of 
state antitrust statutes to interstate commerce). "
238,8," In various guises, a handful of courts in other states have considered the scope of their own state antitrust law with respect to 
interstate trade. Many, but not all, have adopted what amounts to an effects-based standard. See, e.g., Abbott Labs. v. Durrett, 
    So. 2d    , 1998 Ala. LEXIS 208, 1998 WL 436062 (Ala. July 31, 1998) (limiting field of operation to purely intrastate 
transactions); Heath Consultants, Inc. v. Precision Instruments, Inc., 247 Neb. 267, 527 N.W.2d 596, 606-07 (Neb. 1995) 
(extensively quoting Allied Chemical, 9 Wis. 2d 290, 101 N.W.2d 133); C. Bennett Bldg. Supplies Inc. v. Jenn Air Corp., 759 
S.W.2d 883, 889 (Mo. Ct. App. 1988); International Television Prods. Ltd. v. Twentieth Century-Fox Television Div., 622 F. "
239,," Supp. 1532, 1540 (S.D.N.Y. 1985); Lynch Display Corp. v. National Souvenir Ctr. Inc., 640 S.W.2d 837, 840 (Tenn. Ct. App 
1982) (using ""predominance"" standard but rejecting doctrine of mutual exclusivity); R.E. Spriggs Co. v. Adolph Coors Co., 37 
Cal. App. 3d 653, 112 Cal. Rptr. 585, 593 (Cal. Ct. App. 1974) (relying on ""factual nexus"" within state); Commonwealth v. 
McHugh, 326 Mass. 249, 93 N.E.2d 751 (Mass. 1950). "
246,1," Defendant filed a motion requesting that this Court dismiss RPT's appeal for its failure to comply with Rule 84.04(d). While the 
points on appeal are deficient according to the expressed standards, we believe that we can discern the issues which RPT 
attempts to raise. Therefore, we address the merits of the issues as set forth herein and deny Defendant's motion to dismiss. We 
strongly suggest that attorneys review the dictates of Thummel v. King, 570 S.W.2d 679 (Mo. banc 1978) in drafting wherein and 
why the trial court erred."
246,2," Levine cites from the Department of Justice Enforcement Policy which provides assistance in analyzing the exclusion of 
providers from multiprovider networks. Most multiprovider networks will contract with some, but not all, providers in an area. Such selective contracting may be a 
method through which networks limit their provider panels in an effort to achieve quality and cost containment goals and 
enhance their ability to compete against other networks. One reason often advanced for selective contracting is to ensure that "
247,," the network can direct a sufficient patient volume to its providers to justify price concessions or adherence to strict quality 
controls by the providers. Where a geographic market can support several multiprovider networks, there are not likely to be 
significant competitive problems associated with the exclusion of particular providers by particular networks.HN6[
] A rule of reason analysis usually is applied in judging the legality of excluding providers from a multiprovider network. The focus 
of the analysis is not on whether a particular provider has been harmed by the exclusion, but rather whether the exclusion 
reduces competition among providers in the market and thereby harms consumers. Therefore, exclusion may present 
competitive concerns if providers are unable to compete effectively without access to the network, and competition is thereby 
harmed. The Agencies also recognize, however, that there may be procompetitive reasons associated with the exclusion, such 
as the provider's competence or ability and willingness to meet the network's cost-containment goals. In addition, in certain 
circumstances network membership restrictions may be procompetitive by giving nonmember providers the incentive to form 
other networks in order to compete more effectively with the network. Levine, 72 F.3d at 1550-51. "
267,*," Honorable Harry W. Wellford, Senior U.S. Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation. "
268,1," Defendant Harcros Chemicals, Inc., is a chlorine repackager organized under the laws of Delaware with its principal place of 
business in Kansas. Harcros was formerly known as Thompson-Hayward Chemical Co. For purposes of this opinion both 
Thompson-Hayward and Harcros will be referred to as ""Harcros."" Defendant Van Waters & Rogers, Inc., is a chlorine repackager organized under the laws of the State of Washington with its 
principal place of business in Washington. In 1986, Van Waters & Rogers acquired the Moreland-McKesson Chemical 
Company. For purposes of this opinion, both companies are referred to as ""Van Waters."" Defendant Jones Chemicals, Inc., is a chlorine repackager organized under the laws of the State of New York with its principal 
place of business in New York. Defendant PB & S Chemical Company, Inc., is a chlorine repackager organized under the laws of the State of Kentucky with its 
principal place of business in Kentucky. Defendant Industrial Chemicals, Inc., a chlorine distributor for defendants Jones Chemicals and PB & S Chemical Company, is 
organized under the laws of the State of Alabama with its principal place of business in Alabama. The repackaging, distribution and sale of chlorine in Alabama takes place within the flow of interstate commerce, as is necessary 
for the plaintiffs to bring this action. See infra notes 5-7. Chlorine is imported into Alabama for repackaging and is then 
distributed and sold to Alabama municipal entities and to other customers in Alabama and elsewhere."
268,2, A minority of municipal entities negotiated chlorine prices with one or more suppliers. 
269,3," The Justice Department convened a grand jury to investigate the chlorine industry, including the defendants and others, but 
eventually dropped its investigation. Florida's separate investigation yielded two federal antitrust suits: the ""peninsula"" case, filed 
in Jacksonville, and the ""panhandle"" case, filed in Pensacola. The district court assigned to the ""panhandle"" case announced 
that it would grant defendants' motion for summary judgment, at which point the State of Florida agreed to settle both cases. See 
Harcros, 877 F. Supp. at 1511."
269,4," The plaintiffs and plaintiffs-intervenors did not consolidate their two complaints into one. The two complaints, however, are 
largely identical."
269,5," HN1[
] Section 1 provides: § 1. Trusts, etc., in restraint of trade illegal; penalty Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any contract or 
engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on 
conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $ 10,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any other person, $ 350,000, 
or by imprisonment not exceeding three years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court."
269,6," HN2[
] Section 2 provides: § 2. Monopolizing trade a felony; penalty Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of 
a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $ 10,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any other 
person, $ 350,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding three years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the 
court."
269,7," Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides in relevant part: Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue 
therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, 
without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of 
suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. Section 16 of the Clayton Act provides in relevant part: Any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of the United 
States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws, including 
sections 13, 14, 18, and 19 of this title, when and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against 
threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage is granted by courts of equity[.] "
270,8," Price-fixing conspiracies are made unlawful by § 8-10-3 of the Alabama Code, which provides: HN3[
] § 8-10-3 Restraint of trade or production; misdemeanor. Any person or corporation, domestic or foreign, which shall restrain, or attempt to restrain, the freedom of trade or 
production, or which shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, the production, control, or sale of any commodity or the 
prosecution, management, or control of any kind, class, or description of business or which shall destroy, or attempt to 
destroy, competition in the manufacture or sale of a commodity shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall 
be fined not less than $ 500 nor more than $ 2,000 for each offense. Section 6-5-60(a) provides: § 6-5-60 Generally. (a) Any person, firm, or corporation injured or damaged by an unlawful trust, combine or monopoly, or its effect, direct or 
indirect, may, in each instance of such injury or damage, recover the sum of $ 500 and all actual damages from any person, 
firm, or corporation creating, operating, aiding, or abetting such trust, combine, or monopoly and may commence the action 
therefor against any one or more of the parties to the trust, combine, or monopoly, or their attorneys, officers, or agents, 
who aid or abet such trust, combine, or monopoly. All such actions may be prosecuted to final judgment against any one or 
more of the defendants thereto, notwithstanding there may be a dismissal, acquittal, verdict, or judgment in favor of one or 
more of the defendants. HN4[
] Under Alabama law, federal antitrust law ""prescribes the terms of unlawful monopolies and restraints of trade as they should . . . be administered in Alabama."" Ex parte Rice, 259 Ala. 570, 67 So. 2d 825, 829 (Ala. 1953); see also McCluney v. Zap 
Prof'l Photography, 663 So. 2d 922, 926 (Ala. 1995) (citing Rice for the proposition that federal law relating to monopolization 
governs actions brought under section 6-5-60). Our discussion of the relevant federal law, see infra part III, therefore applies to 
and controls our disposition of the plaintiffs' state-law antitrust claims as well as their federal antitrust claims. "
272,9," Because Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D) does not define the term ""agent,"" we must assume that Congress intended to refer to 
general common law principles of agency when it used the term. See United States v. Saks, 964 F.2d 1514, 1523-24 (5th Cir. 
1992) (citing Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 490 U.S. 730, 109 S. Ct. 2166, 2172-73, 104 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1989)). 
HN12[
] At common law, senior officers of a corporation normally are agents and servants of the corporation. See 2A C.J.S. Agency § 4 (1972) (""An agent is . . . a person employed or authorized by another to act for him, or to transact business for him[, 
or] one entrusted with another's business . . . ."") (citing cases); Restatement (Second) of Agency § 2 cmt. c (1958) (""The officers 
of a corporation or a ship, . . . all of whom give their time to their employers, are servants equally with the janitor.""); see also, 
e.g., Shelter Modular Corp. v. Cardinal Enters., Inc., 347 So. 2d 1334, 1338 (Ala. 1977) (vice-president of corporation is agent 
thereof); Ex parte Board of Sch. Comm'rs of Mobile County, 235 Ala. 82, 178 So. 63, 64 (Ala. 1937) (""It is the general rule of the 
common law that the relationship of master and servant exists whenever the employer retains the right to direct the manner in 
which the business shall be done, as well as the result to be accomplished, or, in other words, not only what shall be done, but 
how it shall be done."")."
272,10," The district court found the testimony inadmissible as to Jones on two grounds: (1) that ""the president of a corporation is not 
the 'alter ego' of the corporation,"" and that Jones therefore did not ""speak for"" the corporation, as the court believed was required 
by controlling Alabama evidence law; and (2) that the purported statements did not fall under the co-conspirator hearsay 
exception found in Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). See Harcros, 877 F. Supp. at 1518-19. Both of these rulings are in error. First, it is well settled that HN13[
] the Federal Rules of Evidence, not state evidence law, govern the admissibility of evidence in cases in federal court. See Fed. R. Evid. 1101; Johnson v. William C. Ellis & Sons Iron Works, Inc., 609 F.2d 820, 821 (5th 
Cir. 1980). Under the Federal Rules, ""it is [not] necessary to show that an employee or agent declarant possesses 'speaking 
authority,' tested by the usual standards of agency law, before a statement can be admitted against the principal."" Wilkinson v. 
Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc., 920 F.2d 1560, 1565 (11th Cir. 1991). Instead, it is necessary that the content of the declarant's "
273,," statement concern a matter within the scope of his employment or agency. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D); Wilkinson, 920 F.2d 
at 1565. The district court therefore erred as a matter of law in holding otherwise. Second, HN14[
] Rule 801(d)(2)(E) establishes that ""a statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy"" is non-hearsay evidence. Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). As discussed below, we agree with the 
district court's conclusion that Jones' purported statements were not made ""during the course and in furtherance of the 
conspiracy."" That the Cassassas' testimony is not made admissible by Rule 801(d)(2)(E), however, does not change the fact 
that the testimony is admissible as a party admission under Rule 801(d)(2)(D). "
274,11," The plaintiffs assert that complimentary bids, i.e., bids submitted with no intention of winning the contract in question, were 
used by the defendants to create the illusion of competition in the Alabama chlorine market. The defendants reply that, because 
municipal entities often would solicit bids only from companies that had bid on previous contracts, complimentary bids were used 
merely to stay in the running for future contracts when, for whatever reason, a company did not wish, or was not able, to pursue 
a particular contract."
274,12," The district court apparently excluded the Caine notation on the ground that it did not qualify as a party admission under Rule 
801(d)(2)(D); since Caine did not have final authority over chlorine bids, the court viewed any statement by him regarding the 
Mobile bid in question as ""unauthorized."" Harcros, 877 F. Supp. at 1520. As discussed in note 10, supra, the Federal Rules of 
Evidence do not require that Caine have had ""speaking authority"" in order for his statement to be admissible under the party 
admission exception; the district court's rationale was therefore legally erroneous. We could not determine whether the Caine 
notation is actually admissible as a party admission under Rule 801(d)(2)(D) even if it were necessary to do so, however, 
because the writer of the notation has not been identified and the record on appeal does not disclose whether the document was 
properly authenticated in the district court. The district court excluded the notation without a hearing, solely on the basis of the 
parties' briefs. The plaintiffs also argued that the notation was admissible as a regular business record under Rule 803(6). Rule 803(6) provides 
an exception from the general prohibition on hearsay when the proffered statement is [a] memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any form, of acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnoses, made 
at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge, if kept in the course of a regularly 
conducted business activity, and if it was the regular practice of that business activity to make the memorandum, report, 
record, or data compilation, all as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness, unless the source of 
information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness. Fed. R. Evid. 803(6). The district court apparently rejected this argument without comment, and the plaintiffs complain of this 
holding on appeal. On the basis of the inadequate record on appeal, the notation appears not to have been a properly 
authenticated regular business record. The notation is admissible under Rule 803(6) if it is ""[a] memorandum [or] record . . . of 
acts [or] events . . . made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge"" of the acts in 
question, and ""if it was the regular practice of the business activity to make the memorandum [or] record . . . all as shown by the 
testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness, unless the source of the information or the method or circumstances of 
preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness."" Fed. R. Evid. 803(6) (emphasis added). From the record on appeal, the Caine 
notation appears not to satisfy the requirements of the business records exception because the record reveals no attempt 
whatsoever to authenticate the notation, as is explicitly required by Rule 803(6). See Fed. R. Evid. 803(6); United States v. 
Williams, 837 F.2d 1009, 1013 n.6 (11th Cir. 1988) (proper foundation for admission of 803(6) testimony should include 
testimony of witness with personal knowledge of how document was compiled); Itel Capital Corp. v. Cups Coal Co., 707 F.2d 
1253, 1259-60 (11th Cir. 1983) (person who actually prepared business record need not testify but other circumstantial evidence 
and testimony must suggest trustworthiness of documents); United States v. Dreer, 740 F.2d 18, 20 (11th Cir. 1984) (proper 
foundation for admission of business record must sufficiently indicate reliability, including ""circumstances surrounding the origin 
and the nature of the compilation""). The district court rejected the plaintiffs' invocation of the business records exception, "
275,," however, in the same fashion that it rejected their reliance upon the party admission exception - on the basis of the parties' briefs 
alone. We therefore could not determine whether the district court erred in concluding that the Caine notation is not admissible 
under Rule 803(6), even if it were necessary to do so. We also note that, even if the notation is determined not to be admissible as hearsay, the notation might be admissible as non-
hearsay insofar as it is not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. See Fed. R. Evid. 801. The Caine notation might be 
offered for several purposes other than to prove the truth of the matter asserted. The notation merely could not be offered to 
prove that Caine instructed the Mobile board to withdraw Industrial's bid; the appellants would have to rely on Caine's affidavit 
testimony and other evidence to support that proposition."
275,13," Two statements in the Caine affidavit may have been the cause of the district court's hearsay concerns. In discussing a bid 
that he participated in submitting to the Mobile Water and Sewer Board in 1987, while employed as a sales representative for 
Industrial in the Mobile/Dothan area, Caine stated: ""Mr. William Welch of Industrial Chemicals told me that, because there was a 
tie bid and Jones was the incumbent, Industrial needed to bow out gracefully."" The following sentence of Caine's affidavit read: ""I 
then communicated that information to Mrs. Whitworth [of the Mobile Board] . . . ."" The alleged statement of Welch to Caine, however, constitutes a non-hearsay admission by a party opponent. See Fed. R. Evid. 
801(d)(2)(D). Welch, as president of Industrial, was an agent of the company. In addition, since Welch stated in his deposition 
that he had sole responsibility for determining chlorine bid prices during a period that included 1987, his statement that Industrial 
should ""bow out"" of this particular chlorine bid concerned a matter within the scope of his agency and was made during the 
existence of that agency relationship. Cf. supra note 9 and accompanying text. Caine's report of his past statement to Mrs. Whitworth also qualifies as a non-hearsay admission under Rule 801(d)(2)(D). Welch 
stated in his deposition that Caine was an Industrial sales representative who served the Mobile area during 1987. As such, 
Caine was an agent of Industrial when he communicated Welch's ""bow out"" directive to Mrs. Whitworth of the Mobile Board. 
Communicating a bid (or the withdrawal thereof) authorized by his supervisor to a prospective customer in the Mobile area 
surely was within the scope of Caine's agency as a sales representative for that area. We express no opinion on whether this 
statement would constitute inadmissible hearsay if it did not qualify as an admission. "
276,14," We assume arguendo that Lloyd Krysti ""found out"" about the alleged conspiracy through conversations with Ragusa or by 
overhearing Ragusa speak about the conspiracy. Even if Lloyd ""found out"" about the alleged conspiracy in some other fashion, 
however, our conclusion - that Barbara Krysti's testimony is inadmissible - remains the same. No matter how Lloyd Krysti ""found 
out"" about the conspiracy, Barbara Krysti's recitation of his statements to her is inadmissible hearsay for the reasons stated in 
the text."
276,15," HN22[
] Rule 702 reads: "
277,," Rule 702. Testimony by Experts If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine 
a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in 
the form of an opinion or otherwise."
277,16," The Daubert Court noted that ""HN23[
] the inquiry envisioned by Rule 702 is, we emphasize, a flexible one."" Daubert, 509 U.S. at 594, 113 S. Ct. at 2797. ""Many factors will bear on the inquiry [into whether an expert's reasoning or methodology is 
reliable], and we do not presume to set out a definitive checklist or test."" Id. at 593, 113 S. Ct. at 2796. Nevertheless, the Court 
did identify certain factors that may be pertinent to such an inquiry. These factors include: ""whether [the theory or technique at 
issue] can be (and has been) tested""; whether it ""has been subjected to peer review and publication""; the ""known or potential 
rate of error"" of the technique, as well as the ""existence and maintenance of standards controlling [its] operation""; and the 
degree to which the relevant scientific community accepts the theory or technique as reliable. Id. at 593-94, 113 S. Ct. at 2796-
97. We discuss these factors in greater detail in note 25, infra. "
278,17," Garner holds a C.P.A. license and has experience analyzing the books of companies that participate in allegedly collusive 
markets. The defendants, who did not move for the exclusion of his testimony, do not attack his methodology on appeal. We do 
not doubt that HN24[
] accounting expertise is among the sorts of technical and specialized expertise the use of which is governed by Rule 702 and Daubert. See Morse/Diesel, Inc. v. Trinity Indus., Inc., 67 F.3d 435, 444 (2d Cir. 1995) (stating in 
dicta that expert testimony of certified public accountants is likely to be admissible); Frymire-Brinati v. KPMG Peat Marwick, 2 
F.3d 183, 186 (7th Cir. 1993) (requiring application of Daubert standard to accountant's expert testimony)."
278,18," As is discussed in part III.A.3, infra, HN25[
] in order to prevail on their claim of the existence of a price-fixing conspiracy 
without direct evidence, the plaintiffs must show (1) that the defendants acted in a consciously parallel fashion, and (2) ""plus 
factors"" that tend to exclude the possibility of non-collusive action. See Dunnivant v. Bi-State Auto Parts, 851 F.2d 1575, 1583 
(11th Cir. 1988); Gainesville Utils. Dep't v. Fla. Power & Light Co., 573 F.2d 292, 300-02 (5th Cir. 1978)."
278,19," The district court's opinion is far from clear. The grounds for the exclusion of McClave's testimony that we identify are those 
that we are able to reconstruct from the conclusory and disjointed miscellany that constitutes the district court's discussion of 
McClave's testimony."
278,20," The defendants do not assert, and could not reasonably assert, that McClave is not qualified to testify as to statistical evidence 
in antitrust cases. McClave holds a Ph.D. in statistics and has considerable experience in the analysis of markets alleged to be 
collusive. "
279,21," It is apparent that this problem, along with many others that we identify in this part of the opinion, might have been avoided 
had the district court simply held a Daubert hearing to allow the parties to clarify their positions, as well as the law, regarding the 
admissibility of these experts' testimony. While Daubert hearings are not required by law or by rules of procedure, they are 
almost always fruitful uses of the court's time and resources in complicated cases involving multiple expert witnesses, such as 
the instant case."
279,22," This error is repeated in the district court's discussion of McClave's analysis of tie bids, see Harcros, 877 F. Supp. at 1529, 
and of Industrial's profits, see id. at 1529-30. Whether or not McClave's testimony, standing alone, supports an inference that 
Industrial or any other defendant actually conspired to fix prices is not relevant to the question of the admissibility of the 
testimony; it is instead a matter for consideration at summary judgment, when the court must determine whether a trier of fact 
could find for the plaintiffs on the evidence adduced. See Cohen v. United Am. Bank of Cent. Fla., 83 F.3d 1347, 1349 (11th Cir. 
1996)."
279,23," We draw this conclusion on the basis of the district court's conclusory statement that McClave's ""statistical analysis is not 
impressive."" As we explain below, we conclude that a small portion of McClave's testimony is in fact unreliable and inadmissible. 
At this point, however, we endeavor to clarify the legal errors that permeate the district court's discussion of McClave's (and 
Lanzillotti's) testimony. "
280,24, The defendants do not attack the provenance or authenticity of McClave's raw data.
280,25," Twenty-nine states, along with the territories of Guam and Puerto Rico, have briefed this appeal as amici curiae in support of 
the appellant municipalities. The amici helpfully point out that, although ""an important aspect of assessing scientific validity (and 
therefore evidentiary reliability) is the ability of other scientists to test or retest a proponent's theory,"" not every scientific or 
technical methodology applied by expert witnesses is susceptible to such an analysis.  In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., 35 F.3d 
717, 758 (3d Cir. 1994), cert. denied sub nom.  General Elec. Co. v. Ingram, 513 U.S. 1190, 115 S. Ct. 1253, 131 L. Ed. 2d 
134 (1995). Economic or statistical analysis of markets alleged to be collusive, for instance, cannot readily be repeatedly tested, 
because each such case is widely different from other such cases and because such cases cannot be made the subject of 
repeated experiments. The proper inquiry regarding the reliability of the methodologies implemented by economic and statistical 
experts in this context is not whether other experts, faced with substantially similar facts, have repeatedly reached the same 
conclusions (because there will be few or no cases that have presented substantially similar facts). Instead, the proper inquiry is 
whether the techniques utilized by the experts are reliable in light of the factors (other than testability) identified in Daubert and in 
light of other factors bearing on the reliability of the methodologies. See supra note 16; see also, e.g., Ohio ex rel. Montgomery 
v. Louis Trauth Dairy, Inc., 925 F. Supp. 1247, 1252-53 (S.D. Ohio 1996) (noting that Daubert factors should be applied flexibly 
in determining admissibility of economic and statistical expert testimony); In re Aluminum Phosphide Antitrust Litig., 893 F. Supp. 
1497, 1506 (D. Kan. 1995) (""To the extent that Daubert factors are relevant to its determination [whether an economist's 
methodologies are reliable], the Court considers them along with any other relevant factors. . . . The inquiry is a flexible one, with 
the overarching subject being the evidentiary relevance and reliability of the principles that underlie a proposed submission.""). 
One factor left unenumerated by the Daubert Court is whether ""the methods used by the expert to derive his opinion satisfy the 
standards for scientific methodology that his profession would require of his out-of-court research."" People Who Care v. 
Rockford Bd. of Educ., Sch. Dist. No. 205, 111 F.3d 528, 537 (7th Cir. 1997). Taking this factor into account along with the 
factors identified in Daubert, we readily conclude that McClave's methodologies are quite reliable, with the small exception 
explained infra. "
281,26," The district court also attacked McClave's market definition on the ground that ""Dr. McClave calls his statistics 'market' shares, 
but admits that his numbers only include that portion of the market in which the plaintiffs buy chlorine by sealed bids."" Harcros, 
877 F. Supp. at 1529 n. 58. Our review of the record reveals that the court's assertion is false; McClave's database did indeed 
include data from the Alabama municipalities that purchased chlorine through negotiations with the defendants and other 
chemical companies rather than through sealed-bid auctions, and McClave so stated in both his prepared report and his 
deposition testimony."
281,27," As noted in the introduction to part II.B, supra, the district court lengthily criticized the testimony of Dr. Robert Lanzillotti, an 
economist whose testimony as an expert was proffered by the plaintiffs; the court did not, however, exclude Lanzillotti's 
testimony. The defendants have not questioned the district court's denial of their motion to exclude Lanzillotti's testimony. We 
note in passing that much of Lanzillotti's testimony does indeed appear to warrant exclusion: specifically, Lanzillotti's opinions 
regarding the legal standards applicable to the case are outside of his competence as an economist (and are erroneous) and 
should be excluded. The same is true of Lanzillotti's characterizations of pieces of documentary evidence as tending to show 
collusion; such judgments are for the court to make at summary judgment and for the trier of fact to make at trial. Furthermore, 
we point out that Lanzillotti's professed market definition is clearly wrong. Lanzillotti stated in his report that ""the relevant 
geographic market is the largest market for which data are available and facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of what 
transpired in the State of Alabama."" This is contrary to law and scholarship; HN28[
] the relevant geographic market is the 
market that includes ""producers that provide customers of a defendant firm (or firms) with alternative sources for the defendant's 
product or services."" Levine v. Central Fla. Med. Affiliates, Inc., 72 F.3d 1538, 1552 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 820, 117 
S. Ct. 75, 136 L. Ed. 2d 34 (1996) (quoting IIA Phillip E. Areeda et al., Antitrust Law P 530a, at 150 (1995)). Whether the 
litigants in a particular case are able to compile data regarding a particular market is irrelevant to the market definition analysis. 
See also Thompson v. Metropolitan Multi-List, Inc., 934 F.2d 1566, 1573 (11th Cir. 1991) (discussing geographic market 
definition process in detail). We express no opinion as to whether the market definition that Lanzillotti actually used in his 
analysis is the one that he professed to use in his report; nor do we express any opinion as to whether the use of the professed "
282,," market definition would have any derogatory effect upon the reliability of his testimony. We merely point out that the sort of 
market definition that Lanzillotti professed to use in his report - one with an apparent eye toward litigation - is inaccurate."
282,28," As explained in note 8, supra, our disposition of the plaintiffs' state-law antitrust claims is identical to our disposition of their 
federal antitrust claims. "
283,29," See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 1356, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (""It 
follows from these settled principles that HN29[
] if the factual context renders [plaintiffs'] claim implausible - if the claim is one 
that simply makes no economic sense - [plaintiffs] must come forward with more persuasive evidence to support their claim than 
would otherwise be necessary.""); Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Svcs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 468-69, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 
2083, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992) (""Matsushita demands only that the nonmoving party's inferences be reasonable in order to 
reach the jury . . . . If the plaintiff's theory is economically senseless, no reasonable jury could find in its favor, and summary 
judgment should be granted.""); Helicopter Support Sys., Inc. v. Hughes Helicopter, Inc., 818 F.2d 1530, 1534 (11th Cir. 1987) 
(""Matsushita dictates that if the alleged conspiracy is economically infeasible or irrational then, as a matter of law, summary 
judgment must be entered against the plaintiff."")."
283,30," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), this court adopted as binding precedent all 
decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981."
283,31," See also DeLong Equip. Co. v. Washington Mills Abrasive Co., 887 F.2d 1499, 1515 (11th Cir.1989). "
284,32," The parties agree that the market for repackaged chlorine in Alabama is oligopolistic. See Harcros, 877 F. Supp. at 1509. An 
oligopolistic market may be defined as a market in which ""the dominant participants . . . engage in interdependent or parallel 
behavior and [have] the capacity effectively to determine price and total output of goods or services."" Republic of Tex. Corp. v. 
Board of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys., 649 F.2d 1026, 1044 & n.32 (5th Cir. Unit A June 1981) (quoting United States v. 
Marine Bancorporation, 418 U.S. 602, 630, 94 S. Ct. 2856, 2874, 41 L. Ed. 2d 978 (1974))."
284,33," For the sake of clarity, we read this reference to a defendant's ""economic self-interest"" as a reference to what that defendant's 
legitimate economic self-interest would be under the assumption that it acted alone; a price-fixing conspiracy, if successfully 
implemented, is in the collective self-interest of the conspirators. Cf.  Bolt v. Halifax Hosp. Med. Ctr., 891 F.2d 810, 826-27 (11th 
Cir. 1990) (""The plaintiff must establish that each defendant would have acted unreasonably in a business sense if it had 
engaged in the challenged conduct unless that defendant had received assurances from the other defendants that they would 
take the same action.""); ABA Section of Antitrust Law, Antitrust Law Developments 10 & n.51 (4th ed. 1997)."
284,34," The second sentence of note 30 in Todorov reads: ""Conscious parallelism is uniform business conduct by competitors that 
permits a court to infer the existence of a conspiracy between these competitors."" We read this, in accordance with the 
remainder of that footnote and with the established law and scholarship on the point, to state only the first part of the test; that is, 
consciously parallel behavior permits a court to infer the existence of a conspiracy only in the presence of ""plus factors,"" such as 
the implausibility that the defendants would have acted as they did had they not been unlawfully conspiring in restraint of trade. "
285,35," The district court read Dunnivant to require plaintiffs to show that the defendants' actions were contrary to their legitimate 
economic self-interest, in addition to showing ""plus factors"" that tend to exclude the possibility that the defendants were merely 
practicing conscious parallelism. See Harcros, 877 F. Supp. at 1522-23. There is support for such a reading in the wording of 
Dunnivant. As explained in the text, however, we read Dunnivant, in accordance with the bulk of the law on point and with 
eminent scholarship, to establish only that the plaintiff either must prove that the defendants' actions were contrary to their 
legitimate economic self-interest or must show other ""plus factors"" tending to exclude the possibility of lawful action. See 
Gainesville Utils., 573 F.2d at 300-02; VI Areeda, Antitrust Law P 1434, at 213-221 (noting on p. 213 that, ""with rare exception, 
the courts have been very clear that mere parallelism, including interdependent conscious parallelism[,] cannot support a 
conspiracy finding unless there are additional or 'plus' factors.""); ABA, Antitrust Law Developments 8-14. In other words, 
whether the defendants' actions were contrary to their legitimate economic self-interest is only one prominent ""plus factor"" that 
plaintiffs may attempt to prove. Our review of this circuit's law on point did disclose the following statement from Bolt v. Halifax Hosp. Med. Ctr., 891 F.2d 810, 
826 (11th Cir. 1990): ""HN34[
] The rule in this circuit is that evidence of conscious parallelism does not permit an inference of 
conspiracy unless the plaintiff establishes that each defendant engaging in the parallel action acted contrary to its economic self-
interest."" As explained in the preceding paragraph, a showing that the defendant acted contrary to its legitimate economic self-
interest, see supra note 33, is sufficient to satisfy the requirement that the plaintiff show ""plus factors"" beyond mere consciously 
parallel action. Other ""plus factors,"" however, may also exist. On a different note, we observe that the district court cited our decision in Helicopter Support Systems., Inc. v. Hughes 
Helicopter, Inc., 818 F.2d 1530, 1534 & n.4 (11th Cir. 1987), as support for its addition of another prong to the established test 
for finding an agreement to restrain trade: that the plaintiff is required to ""exclude the possibility of independent action on the part 
of the defendants."" See Harcros, 877 F. Supp. at 1532. This citation was erroneous for two reasons. First, the language that the 
district court relied upon was addressed to plaintiffs who bring distributor-termination claims; that type of claim was not brought 
in this case. See Helicopter Support, 818 F.2d at 1534 (""The plaintiff in a distributor-termination case must also be able to point 
to evidence which tends to exclude the possibility that the manufacturer was operating independently in making his 
determination to terminate the distributor.""). In addition, the Helicopter Support language merely restated Matsushita's 
requirement (drawn from Monsanto) that the plaintiff show that an inference of conspiracy is reasonable, i.e., that the plaintiff 
allege a plausible conspiracy that is sufficiently supported by the circumstantial evidence. See Helicopter Support, 818 F.2d at 
1533 (after noting that evidence excluding independent action is required by Monsanto, we stated that, ""in short, Monsanto 
establishes that conduct which is as equally consistent with permissible competition as it is with an illegal conspiracy does not, 
without more, support even an inference of conspiracy.""). Helicopter Support, therefore, does not provide a basis for grafting an 
additional requirement onto the established test. "
286,36," Cf.  Petruzzi's IGA Supermarkets, Inc. v. Darling-Delaware Co., 998 F.2d 1224, 1245 (3d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom.  Moyer 
Packing Co. v. Petruzzi's IGA Supermarkets, Inc., 510 U.S. 994, 114 S. Ct. 554, 126 L. Ed. 2d 455 (1993) (in finding that 
defendants' refusal to bid on existing accounts as aggressively as new accounts constituted a plus factor, the court stated: 
""absent an agreement it does not make economic sense for defendants not to bid on an account, unless they have some 
problem like capacity or they know that the existing price is too high.""); 998 F.2d at 1246 (""It is one thing for competitors all to 
charge the same price, as a perfectly competitive market could lead them to do so. It is quite another for competitors all to refrain 
from soliciting each other's accounts.""); VI Areeda, Antitrust Law PP 1420d & 1420' (1986 & Supp. 1997)."
286,37," The plaintiffs also point to other evidence that, they assert, supports the existence of two additional ""plus factors"": delivered 
pricing (i.e., pricing that includes all transportation costs) and departure from the business practices that prevailed before the 
period of the alleged conspiracy. (The remainder of the plaintiffs' asserted ""plus factors"" are certainly no more supportive of an 
inference of collusion than of an inference of conscious parallelism.) We do not consider whether delivered pricing and departure 
from previous business practices do in fact establish ""plus factors"" in this case, however, because our conclusion regarding 
incumbency rates in the market suffices to support the holding we reach today."
286,38," Defendant Van Waters astutely points out in its brief that, if the defendants had wished to conspire, it would have been 
smarter to ""rotate incumbencies,"" i.e., to alter the distribution of contracts from time to time in order to minimize incumbency 
rates and prevent a holding such as the one we reach today. We agree (although we also point out that such an arrangement 
likely would have required more explicit, and hence more dangerous, collusion); nonetheless, the high incumbency rates 
exhibited in the market would not likely have occurred in the absence of some sort of communication among the defendants. 
Those rates therefore establish the necessary ""plus factor."""
286,39," In this part of the opinion we review the district court's entry of summary judgment on the antitrust claims against Harcros and 
Industrial. As stated in part III.A.1, however, this discussion applies to Jones Chemicals as well. "
287,40," One such letter, from Jones Chemicals, read: Although it in no way reflects the wishes of Jones Chemicals, we find it necessary to adjust our selling prices from time to 
time in order to keep up with the ever increasing cost of staying in business as a reliable source of chemicals."
287,41," One such clause, included in a bid document executed by Harcros for the benefit of the City of Lafayette, stated: I hereby affirm I have not been in any agreement or collusion among bidders or prospective bidders in restraint of freedom 
of competition, by agreement to bid at a fixed price or to refrain from bidding, or otherwise."
287,42," Because we affirm the district court's entry of summary judgment on the antitrust claims against Van Waters & Rogers and PB 
& S, we also affirm its entry of summary judgment on the plaintiffs' claim that these two defendants made fraudulent 
representations of non-collusion in bid documents."
287,43," In its order granting summary judgment, the district court also held that the defendants' fraud, if it occurred, was excused by 
the lack of a ""confidential relationship with the plaintiffs requiring disclosure of the existence of a conspiracy."" Harcros, 877 F. 
Supp. at 1537. The court cited Lowder Realty, Inc. v. Odom, 495 So. 2d 23, 26 (Ala. 1986); Holdbrooks v. Central Bank of Ala., 
N.A., 435 So. 2d 1250, 1252 (Ala. 1983); and Tonsmeire v. Tonsmeire, 285 Ala. 454, 233 So. 2d 465, 468 (Ala. 1970), in 
support of this proposition. These cases, and the doctrine they reflect, require that a close relationship exist between two parties 
before there arises a duty to disclose - that is, not to remain silent - about facts material to the relationship. See id. In the instant 
case, however, the plaintiffs allege not that the defendants merely failed to speak up about the alleged conspiracy, but that the 
defendants made affirmative and explicit misrepresentations to them regarding the existence of the conspiracy and the 
defendants' costs. These cases, and the doctrine underlying them, are therefore inapposite. "
298,1," The prosecution history of this patent is discussed more fully in Part IV(d), infra. "
299,2," The Order also specified that two other topics would be discussed: a motion to disqualify Plaintiff's counsel, and a Motion in 
Limine from the Defendant. (Order [Doc. # 76], at 2.) "
301,3," Although PRE was a copyright case, the Supreme Court seemed to generalize its discussion to cover all ""sham"" litigation, see 
PRE, 508 U.S. at 60, such that the requirements discussed in PRE apply to a patent infringement case as well. See, e.g., 
Filmtec Corp. v. Hydranautics, 67 F.3d 931, 937 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (applying the PRE test to a patent infringement case)."
301,4," HN8[
] The law of the Federal Circuit will control the question of whether conduct in enforcing a patent infringement suit is 
sufficient to strip a patentee of its immunity from antitrust laws. Nobelpharma AB v. Implant Innovations, Inc., 141 F.3d 1059, "
302,1068," (Fed. Cir. 1998). However, in the instant case, the law of the Fourth Circuit will still control the resolution of issues involving 
other elements of antitrust law, such as relevant market. See id."
302,5," HN12[
] The Supreme Court, in Warner-Jenkinson, reaffirmed the vitality of the doctrine of equivalents; however, it also held 
that amendments made during the prosecution of a patent should be presumed to be ""related to patentability"" if no other reason 
can be shown for the amendment. The holding thereby expanded the effect that prosecution history estoppel has on the doctrine 
of equivalents. See Warner-Jenkinson, 520 U.S. at 29, 117 S. Ct. at 1051; see also discussion infra Part IV(d). "
303,6," Indeed, Master Design consistently has asserted that it was this leg and apron design -- and not the type of table top -- that 
was the inventive concept behind its patent application. (See Def. Ans. [Doc. # 5], at Ex.A, File Wrapper, Resp. Paper No. 4 and 
Supplemental Information Disclosure Statement, at 2.)"
303,7," This question regarding the doctrine of equivalents was never reached by the summary judgment opinion in the instant case, 
because it was determined that prosecution history estoppel precluded Master Design from arguing infringement under the 
doctrine of equivalents. Moreover, it would not be proper to speculate on a possible outcome under the doctrine of equivalents. 
Yet, it is safe to say that, under the Gorham test, an objective litigant in Master Design's position would not be unreasonable in 
believing that it had a legitimate chance of success in an infringement suit based on the doctrine of equivalents. "
304,8," The pertinent part of § 121 reads: HN18[
] ""If two or more independent and distinct inventions are claimed in one application, the Commissioner may require the application to be restricted to one of the inventions."" 35 U.S.C. § 121."
304,9," The first rejection was pursuant to the second paragraph of § 112, which reads: HN19[
] ""The specification shall conclude 
with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his 
invention."" 35 U.S.C. § 112(2). The second rejection was pursuant to the first paragraph of § 112, as well as the second 
paragraph. The first paragraph provides: HN20[
] ""The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, and of 
the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in 
the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same, and shall set forth the best 
mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention."" 35 U.S.C. § 112(1)."
304,10," The complete File Wrapper is contained in Defendant's Answer [Doc. # 5], Ex. A. "
305,11," Prior to the appellate court's opinion, but after the magistrate judge's decision in Bayer, it was ruled that the PTO could only 
restrict -- and not reject -- an application based on § 121. See Application of Weber, 580 F.2d 455, 458 (3d Cir. 1978). This 
change in policy explains the Federal Circuit's use of the term ""restriction"" in a case originally involving a § 121 rejection. "
307,12," Given the Warner-Jenkinson presumption that all amendments relate to patentability, this question should arise less frequently 
in the future. Yet, even before Warner-Jenkinson, HN25[
] if the amendment clearly was made in response to an obviousness objection under § 103, for example, prosecution history estoppel would apply. See Texas Instruments, Inc., 988 F.2d at 1174 
(""As a general proposition, prosecution history estoppel is based upon a showing that an applicant amended a claim to avoid a 
cited prior art reference.""). In the face of such a clear amendment, an infringement suit certainly could be objectively baseless. "
308,13," This assertion was supported in the record by a Supplemental Affidavit from Leonard H. Frankel, the president of Europa, 
which was submitted with other evidence at the hearing. (See Evidence Submitted Supp. Def.'s Antitrust Counterclaim [Doc. # 
80], Ex.1.) "
309,14," In fact, some of Europa's own evidence seems to undermine its theory of the relevant market. The product information from 
Master Design seems not only to divide up the occasional table market into ""niches,"" as argued by Europa, but it also divides up 
the niches according to price ranges. Moreover, Mr. Frankel's affidavit suggests that the price of an occasional table is as 
important to the consumer as the style. (See Master Design's Supplementation of Record [Doc. # 81], Affidavit of Leonard 
Frankel, at 246-251.) Furniture makers attempt to produce tables at each ""price point,"" in order to fill out a ""complete line"" of 
tables. Id. This evidence suggests that the real market is determined by price points, and not by specific types of tables -- a 
factual matter about which Europa offered no evidence. "
315,1," The record reveals that there may be at least two other pending cases involving this matter. Our opinion is limited solely to the 
particular facts and circumstances of this case, and we express no opinion concerning the application of these principles in any 
other cases. "
316,2," Cleveland Stevedore filed a notice of appeal from the trial court's judgment on the jury verdict before the court denied its timely 
motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or new trial. Cleveland Stevedore did not file a separate notice of appeal from 
the denial of its motion for new trial. Bessemer filed a motion to dismiss the appeal in part on the grounds that Cleveland 
Stevedore did not appeal from the denial of its motion for new trial. The motion was referred to the merit panel for disposition. During the course of the appeal, a motion panel of this Court granted Cleveland Stevedore's motion to amend its notice of 
appeal to challenge the denial of its motion for new trial. As a result, that portion of Bessemer's motion to dismiss the appeal for 
failing to appeal the denial of the motion for new trial was rendered moot. The remainder of Bessemer's motion, which sought to 
dismiss Cleveland Stevedore's challenge to the denial of a pretrial motion for summary judgment, was not supported by any 
authority showing that dismissal was appropriate. For these reasons, Bessemer's motion to dismiss the appeal is hereby denied."
316,3, See Appendix. 
318,4," In its appellate brief Cleveland Stevedore narrowed this assignment. Its brief challenges only the trial court's instructions, but its 
motion for new trial raised additional issues. Because Cleveland Stevedore does not separately argue each aspect of its motion 
for new trial under this assignment of error, we deem the omitted arguments to be waived for purposes of this assignment. "
319,5," The argument that a party was required to prove damages to establish any injury is similar to one the Twelfth District rejected in 
Williams v. Oeder (1995), 103 Ohio App. 3d 333, 342, 659 N.E.2d 379. As in Williams, the instructions in the case at bar do not 
constitute reversible error. They did not improperly require proof of enhanced injury to satisfy the requirement of injury or 
confuse the existence of injury with resulting damages. "
320,6," The trial court took the first three special interrogatories verbatim from Cleveland Stevedore's proposed interrogatories. 
However, from Bessemer's proposed interrogatories the court added an injury element to the remaining two interrogatories 
submitted to the jury. Interrogatory 4A stated, ""Was the agreement, combination or conspiracy a material cause of injury to the 
business or property of Pacific Great Lakes/Cleveland Stevedore at Dock 20?"" Interrogatory 5A repeated the question, but 
substituted ""at Huron?"" for ""at Dock 20?"" Stating these separate injury elements separately for each dock eliminated any 
argument that Cleveland Stevedore was required to prove its claims concerning both docks to establish the existence of any "
321,," injury. Interrogatories 4B and 5B further clarified the matter by inquiring as to the year when each respective injury first occurred. 
Finally, interrogatories 4C and 5C specifically inquired about the compensatory damages for each injury."
321,7," The Ohio Valentine Act was patterned after the federal Sherman Antitrust Act and has been interpreted in light of federal 
judicial constructions of that Act.  C.K. & J.K., Inc. v. Fairview Shopping Center (1980), 63 Ohio St. 2d 201, 204, 407 N.E.2d 507; 
Schweizer v. Riverside Methodist Hospitals (1996), 108 Ohio App. 3d 539, 671 N.E.2d 312. Although we likewise cite and 
discuss federal cases, we expressly limit our holding to Ohio law."
321,8," At the conclusion of the trial, Cleveland Stevedore sought to avoid this requirement and broaden its antitrust claims when it 
contended it was already engaged in the business because of the four shipments of iron ore pellets that it handled. Although its 
complaint did not present this claim, and the trial court instructed the jurors at the outset of the case to the contrary, the final 
instructions embraced this theory. The jury was specifically instructed as follows: ""If you determine that Cleveland Stevedore's 
alleged injury was to its ongoing business or the mere growth in an ongoing business, no intent and preparedness showing is 
required."" (Tr. 7320.) If the jury accepted Cleveland Stevedore's argument that it was an existing business in the iron ore 
transportation field, any error on the intent and preparedness instruction would be irrelevant because Cleveland Stevedore 
would not have been required to establish this element. "
322,9," See also the court's concluding instructions, which contained the same phrasing of this requirement, quoted Tr. at p. 15. "
323,10," Cleveland Stevedore makes a similar argument concerning its claim of the concerted refusal to remove the restriction on using 
Dock 20 to unload iron ore, although it never requested a futility instruction concerning this claim. "
324,11," We specifically reject Cleveland Stevedore's reliance on Affiliated Capital Corp. v. City of Houston (5th Cir. 1984), 735 F.2d 
1555, which is its most favorable appellate case. Affiliated Capital made a stronger showing than Cleveland Stevedore that it 
was prepared to enter the market and had taken more steps to enter. Affiliated's exclusion from a government-franchised local 
cable television monopoly, moreover, provides a much stronger basis to infer resulting injury than the alleged exclusion in the 
case at bar. "
325,12," Prior to trial Cleveland Stevedore raised this matter by filing a motion for collateral estoppel and a motion for summary 
judgment. Although the latter motion included photocopies of the trial and appellate opinions in the MDL 587 litigation, Cleveland 
Stevedore never filed certified copies of the relevant documents. At least one court has held that the failure to file such 
documents ""reinforces the denial of the application"" for preclusion.  Struzynski v. Borden Chemical Div., Borden Inc. (1989), 57 
Ohio App. 3d 118, 120, 567 N.E.2d 279. "
326,13," MDL 587 held that the claims were not barred by Section 5a immunity under 49 U.S.C. 10706 or the Keogh doctrine.  In re 
Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litigation (3rd Cir. 1993), 998 F.2d 1144. Pinney Dock, however, held that certain claims were 
barred by these principles.  Pinney Dock & Transport Corp. v. Penn Central Corp. (6th Cir. 1988), 838 F.2d 1445."
326,14," There is likewise evidence that Cleveland Stevedore could have joined in the prior MDL 587 litigation to warrant denying its 
request to invoke ""offensive"" non-mutual collateral estoppel in the case at bar. See Eason v. Linden Avionics Inc. (D.N.J. 1989), 
706 F. Supp. 311, 318-319. After the Bessemer indictment, Cleveland Stevedore was contacted in 1982 and again in 1984, this 
time by an MDL 587 expert, six years before this case. Counsel for Cleveland Stevedore also represented parties in Pinney 
Dock and MDL 587. "
327,15," We note that Good's written expert report contained similar statements. (DX1340 at pp. 2, 7-8, and 21). The record indicates 
that redactions were subsequently made to the report. Cleveland Stevedore withdrew its objection to the report when it was 
redacted and did not include in the appellate record the redacted version. (Tr. 7070, 7353.) For these reasons Cleveland 
Stevedore may have waived any error concerning Good's testimony. We decline, however, to rule on this basis, because we 
prefer to address the merit."
327,16," During voir dire he testified, inter alia, that banks would not make a loan to a company if the company's net worth was less 
than 50% of the principal balance of the loan. During trial he testified that the first phase of Cleveland Stevedore's project would 
have required a bank to lend four times its net worth. "
336,1, All statutory references are to RSMo 1994 unless otherwise noted. 
338,2," The nature of the Board of Trustees of North Kansas City Hospital was thoroughly discussed in Russell, 843 S.W.2d at 355-
56. The Supreme Court concluded that the Board of Trustees was not a separate entity from the city and was merely a part of 
the city government just like the mayor, the city council, zoning commissions, boards of adjustment, park boards, and boards 
created to operate municipally owned utilities.  Russell, 843 S.W.2d at 357."
338,3," The Board of Trustees provided by resolution, ""Whereas, Section 610.023.1, R.S.Mo., provides that a public governmental 
body is to appoint a custodian who is to be responsible for the maintenance of that body's records and the identity and location 
of the custodian is to be made available upon request. . . Now, therefore, be it resolved: That the President of North Kansas City 
Hospital be and hereby is appointed custodian of the records of North Kansas City Hospital . . ."""
338,4," Consequently, even if the hospital were a separate entity from the Board of Trustees, since the documents in question are 
""retained by"" the Board of Trustees, they qualify as ""public records"" under the Sunshine Law. § 610.010.6. "
339,5," The trial court also found that the litigation and real estate exceptions were appropriately applied to close certain requested 
records. While St. Luke's challenged the trial court's rulings relating to the litigation and real estate exceptions in its original brief, 
the Board of Trustees' response indicated that the requested documents to which these exceptions would have applied had 
already been provided to St. Luke's. Both parties agree that these arguments are rendered moot."
339,6," ""If a public record contains material which is not exempt from disclosure as well as material which is exempt from disclosure, 
the public governmental body shall separate the exempt and nonexempt material and make the nonexempt material available for 
examination and copying."" § 610.024.1. "
341,7," Certainly, the Board of Trustees has valid commercial reasons for wishing to keep the information contained in the requested 
documents from the hands of a competitor of NKC Hospital.  State ex rel. Blue Cross & Blue Shield v. Anderson, 897 S.W.2d 
167, 170-71 (Mo. App. S.D. 1995). While the protection of trade secrets perhaps should be an exception to the Sunshine Law, § 
610.021 currently contains no such provision. "
342,8," Section 610.021(13) allows public governmental bodies to close ""individually identifiable personnel records, performance 
ratings or records pertaining to employees or applicants for employment, except that this exemption shall not apply to the 
names, positions, salaries and lengths of service of officers and employees of public agencies once they are employed as such."" 
§ 610.021(13). "
347,1," Defendants' Memorandum of Points and Authorities in support of Defendants' Joint Motion for Summary Judgment is cited as 
""Deft's Memo""; plaintiff's opposition as ""Pitf's Oppos.,"" and defendant's reply thereto as ""Deft's Reply."" "
348,2," See Black's Law Dictionary 965 (6th ed. 1990) (defining ""manufacture"" to include the ""production of articles for use from raw or 
prepared materials by giving such materials new forms, qualities, properties or combinations"")."
348,3," There is no question that the D.C. Council had the authority to do so. In California v. ARC America Corp., 490 U.S. 93, 98 n.3, 
101-102, 109 S. Ct. 1661, 104 L. Ed. 2d 86 (1989), the Supreme Court held that state indirect purchaser statutes, such as 
Section 4509, are not preempted by federal law and, in so doing, made specific reference to the D.C. provision. See also 
Shepherd Park Citizens Ass'n v. General Cinema Beverages, 584 A.2d 20, 23-25 (D.C. 1990)."
348,4," Defendants' reliance on Section 4515 of the D.C. Antitrust Act is misplaced. That section provides: ""It is the intent of the Council of the District of Columbia that in construing this [Act], a court of competent jurisdiction may 
use as a guide interpretations given by federal courts to comparable antitrust statutes."" (Emphasis supplied). Since the D.C. Act was passed to distinguish D.C.  [*8] antitrust law from federal law with respect to standing for indirect 
purchasers, there is no ""comparable"" federal antitrust statute. "
349,5," Defendants also allege that Justice Brennan auggested that standing take account of two factors: ""the number of intervening 
hands the product has passed through and the extent of its change in the process.'"" Deft's Memo at 8. This is sa 
misinterpretation of Justice Brennan's dissent. Having pointed out that the proof problems of indirect purchasers are ""factual 
matter[s] to be determined based on the strength of the plaintill's evidence,"" Id. at 759, Justice Brennan then followed that 
statement with a footnote, stating: One commentator has suggested that, in deciding whether to permit recovery by indirect purchasers in a particuar case, 
cotrts should consider the number of intsrvening hands the product nas passed through and the extent of its change in the 
process. P. Areeda, Antitrust Analysis: Problems, Toxts, Casee 75 (2d ed. 1974). Id. at 759 n.15. Justice Brennan's dissent, read as a whoic, shows that this was not formula he adopted for delermining standing."
349,6," This test, suqqested by Justice Brennan, satisfied defendants' position that the court should apply common  [*12] law concepts 
""to linit the universe of persons who may recover under the antitrust laws"" even where, as here, the statutory language ""broadly 
provides a remedy to 'any person' injured by an antitrust violation."" Deft's Reply at 3-4."
349,7," Quoting Professor Ageeda, Justice Brennan pointed out that ""[i]t would indeed be 'paradoxical to deny recover[y] to the ultimate 
consumer while permitting the middlemen a windfall recovery.'"" Id., quoting P. Arenda, Antitrust Analysis: Problems, Text, Cases 
75 (2d ed. 1974). "
350,8," Subsections 28-4509 (b) and (c) provide: (b) In actions where both direct and indirect purchasers are involved, a defendant shall be entitled to prove as a partial or 
complete defense to a claim for damages that the illegal overcharge has been passed on to others who are themselves entitled 
to recover so as to avoid duplication of recovery of damages. (c) In any case in which claims are asserted by both direct purchasers and indirect purchasers, the court may transfer and 
consolidate cases, apportion damages and delay disbursement of damages to avoid multiplicity of suits and duplication of 
recovery of damages, and to obtain substantial fairness. "
351,9," See also Committee Report at 2 (revealing an intent when apportioning damages to give consideration ""to a party who has 
taken the lead or has been most effective in pursuit of the interest of the consumers"")."
351,10," In re Master Key Antitrust Litigation was a case where plaintiffs, who had purchased buildings containing price-fixed hardware 
components of doors that were installed in the buildings, claimed that increased hardware prices had been passed onto them in 
the prices they had ultimately paid for the buildings."
351,11," See, e.g., Philadelphia Housing Auth. v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Corp., 50 F.R.D. 13 (E.D. Pa. 1970), aff'd sub

Rite Mfg. Corp., 395 F. Supp. 287 (S.D.N.Y. 1975) (zippel component)."
351,13," Like the District of Columbia, a few states enacted indirect purchaser provisions in response to Illinois Rrick. See, e.g., Bus. & 
Prof. Code § 16750(a); Hawaii Rev. stat. § 480-14(c); Wis. Stat. Ann. § 133.18(1). At lest one state court has interpreted its 
antitrust statute to reach the opposite conclusion of Illinois Brick. See Hyde v. Abbott Labs., 123 N.C. App. 572, 473 S.E.2d 680 
(N.C. App. 1996)."
351,14," Defendants  [*20] cite the case of B.W.I. Custom Kitchen v. Owens-Illinois, Inc., 191 Cal. App. 3d 1341, 235 Cal. Rptr. 228 
(Ct. App. 1987), in which a California court granted standing to an indirect purchaser of allegedly price-fixed glass bottles. The 
court noted that where a product ""is ultimately sold to the consumer, and is largely unchanged in form from the price-fixing 
manufacturer to the indirect purchaser, assessing whether the manufacturer's overcharges were passed on is less difficult."" Id. 
at 235. This court finds unpersuasive this very inconclusive dicta from a court in another jurisdiction interpreting an indirect 
purchaser provision with different statutory language. "
355,1," See Union Carbide v. Montell N.V., 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12228, 95 Civ. 0134, 1998 WL 474207, *1-2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 12,

Black, on Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment, submitted June 23, 1998. "
357,2," This case has been very burdensome to the judicial system. In the close to four years that the case has been pending, the 
parties filed nine (9) motions, apart from the thirty (30) motions now pending. Two magistrate judges have handled innumerable 
discovery and trial disputes, including 2,300 objections to proposed trial evidence. The parties have also retained four (4) special 
masters to assist in resolving complex motions and supervising settlement talks. In addition, the Court has already issued five 
(5) significant opinions in this matter. "
358,3," ""Project Global"" refers to UCC's negotiations with ENI, a company owned by the Government of Italy, to acquire Himont, ME's 
polypropylene subsidiary, in order to create a global polyolefins company combining their polyethylene and polypropylene assets 
('polyolefins' are a group of compounds which include polyethylene, polypropylene, and polybutylene). ME contends that UCC's 
simultaneous pursuit of Project Global and Project Nautilus (the UCC/SOC venture) caused UCC to delay the Nautilus 
discussions. ME further argues that UCC's inattention to Nautilus proximately caused Shell Oil Company (""SOC"") to exercise its 
right to accept Royal Dutch Shell's (""RDS"") invitation to participate in Project Sophia talks. Project Sophia was the ME/RDS joint 
venture later to become Montell. Therefore, according to ME's theory, any injury to UCC resulted not from ME's alleged 
conspiracy with SOC to interfere with Project Nautilus, but from UCC's own conduct. Defendant also seeks to show that UCC's 
pursuit of Project Global establishes that the Cooperative Undertaking Agreement (""CUA"") allowed SOC and UCC to pursue 
alternative business opportunities. Finally, Defendant seeks the admission of evidence relating to Project Global in order to 
prove that this lawsuit is really about UCC's competition with RDS to obtain Himont, and that UCC's loss in that competition is 
not an antitrust injury. See Defendant's Response to Plaintiff's Motion in Limine to Exclude Evidence of or Reference to Alleged 
Conduct of Plaintiff for the Purpose of Showing Purported Similarity to Defendant's Unlawful Conduct at 1-2."
358,4, Global Plastics refers to a 1990 business proposal by ENI to UCC for the purpose of purchasing Himont.
358,5," Between 1989 and 1991, Project Nautilus negotiations involved a proposed expanded joint venture between SOC and UCC 
which contemplated the building of two new polypropylene resin plants. "
360,6," The Court notes that this motion is strikingly similar to UCC Motion # 3 in which UCC moved to preclude this and other 
evidence of UCC's polyethylene business, discussed above at Part II.3. In that motion, UCC moved to preclude evidence of 
""plans, actions, opinions, or communications by or with UCC with respect to Montedison's and/or Himont's polyethylene 
business, including Spherilene technology."" See Plaintiff's Memorandum in Support of UCC's Motion in Limine to Exclude 
Evidence of or Reference to Alleged Conduct of UCC for the Purpose of Showing Purported Similarity to Defendant's Unlawful 
Conduct at 9."
360,7," Plaintiff's Motion in limine Number 15 seeks to preclude evidence relating to the alleged 15% discount. Plaintiff's Motion in 
limine Number 17 seeks to preclude the testimony of William D. McCombe, the Court-appointed appraiser of SPC's assets. 
Defendant seeks to offer Mr. McCombe as a fact witness with personal knowledge of the appraisal proceeding. Defendant 
argues that Mr. McCombe's testimony is relevant to the mitigation of damages. "
361,8," EniMont was a joint venture between the state-owned chemical company, ENI, and ME's polypropylene assets."
361,9," Pursuant to a court-ordered break-up of EniMont in Italy, the Italian government seized EniMont's assets. ME then allegedly 
bribed government officials to obtain an artificially-inflated price for the EniMont assets and attempted to sell its half of the 
EniMont assets at this price."
361,10," UCC alleges that this second bribe resulted in a two-year suspension of talks between UCC and ENI before the companies 
were able to reach an agreement. "
362,11," See Union Carbide Corp. v. Montell N.V., 27 F. Supp. 2d 414, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12009, at *4-15 (S.D.N.Y. 1998). "
363,12," UCC is attempting to prove the motives of both SOC and its licensing customers through proof of the motives of its resin 
customers in lodging complaints. This transference is illogical. "
379,1," The state antitrust claims are analyzed under the same precedent as the federal claims. Pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 
445.784(2): It is the intent of the legislature that in construing all sections of this act, the courts shall give due deference to 
interpretations given by the federal courts to comparable antitrust statutes, including, without limitation, the doctrine of per 
se violations and the rule of reason. "
380,2," According to Baum: ""In amateur baseball, the Division I teams of the NCAA are recognized in the sport as a flagship standard 
setter, so that the use of a baseball bat with high performance hitting capabilities at the NCAA Division I level will permeate 
amateur baseball and cause NCAA Division II and III teams, high school teams, and little league baseball teams to follow suit 
and employ similar baseball bats. Thus, control of bat selection at the NCAA Division I level controls bat selection through all of 
amateur baseball and the market for amateur baseball bats."" "
381,3," Baum briefly mentions that defendants ""engaged in fixing of prices for aluminum and aluminum alloy bats by artificially inflating 
prices at the retail level to secure monopoly profits and to fund the protection of their monopoly."""
381,4," HN1[
] Under 15 U.S.C. § 1: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any contract or 
engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony . . . ."
381,5," HN2[
] Under 15 U.S.C. § 2: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of 
a felony . . ."
381,6," The related concepts of antitrust injury and antitrust standing are often confused. This confusion occurs because the two concepts ""share a common ingredient."" The common ingredient is that both 
requirements limit ""recovery to those who have been injured by restraint on competitive forces in the economy."" Any injury "
382,," to determine whether antitrust injury has been shown is more limited than one to determine whether the plaintiff has 
standing. The single determinant of antitrust injury is whether the plaintiff has suffered an ""injury the type the antitrust laws 
were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes [a defendant's] act [] unlawful."" On the other hand, even if 
an antitrust injury is shown sufficiently, standing may be denied on the basis of other factors. The purpose of the additional 
inquiries is to confine recovery to cases that promote the congressional intent to ensure that consumers receive the 
benefits of competitive markets. Axis S.p.A. v. Micafil, Inc., 870 F.2d 1105, 1110-11 (6th Cir. 1989) (citations omitted)."
382,7," ""It is important for courts to keep in mind that the main purpose of the antitrust laws is to preserve and promote competition. 
Whether or not a particular practice violates the antitrust laws is determined by its effect on competition, not its effect on a 
competitor."" Richter Concrete Corp. v. Hilltop Concrete Corp., 691 F.2d 818, 825 (6th Cir. 1982). "
383,8, Baum has not alleged that defendant bat manufacturers have conspired to divide the market.
383,9," Baum's concern about the safety of the aluminum bats does not alter the analysis of whether an antitrust injury exists. In 
National Soc'y of Prof'l Eng'rs, 435 U.S. at 695, the Supreme Court stated that an attempt to justify a restraint on competition ""on 
the basis of the potential threat that competition poses to the public safety and the ethics of its profession is nothing less than a 
frontal assault on the basic policy of the Sherman Act."" "
385,10," In analyzing whether the alleged violation of the antitrust laws was the ""necessary predicate"" to Baum's injury, the Court 
assumes that defendants violated the antitrust laws."
385,11," In addition, the NCAA argues that the antitrust claims should be dismissed on the ground that it is not subject to Sherman Act 
scrutiny under the circumstances because formulation of bat performance standards is a ""fundamentally noncommercial 
activity."" This argument, however, need not be addressed given that Baum lacks standing to bring the antitrust claims."
385,12," Although Baum argues that defendant bat manufacturers have misrepresented the elements of the claim, the elements Baum 
argues are applicable also contain an element of breach. "
390,1," Count III of the First Amended Complaint has been dismissed, as well as any claims asserted in Count II arising out of 
Paragraph 56(a), any antitrust claims arising out of Paragraph 56(b), and any claims in Count V[-1] arising out of an alleged 
refusal to sell voice mail services. Order Affirming the Recommended Decision of the Magistrate Judge (""Affirming Order"") 
(Docket No. 111) at 2. The First Amended Complaint includes two counts identified as Count V; the first will be referred to herein 
as Count V-1 and the second as Count V-2."
390,2," The plaintiff, CTC Communications Corp. (""CTC""), ""voluntarily dismiss[es]"" claims based on Paragraphs 41(i), 56(m) and 86(j) 
in its First Amended Complaint. CTC Communications' Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Bell Atlantic's Motion for Summary 
Judgment (""CTC's Opposition"") (Docket No. 101) at 4 n.1. CTC also contends that Bell has not challenged Paragraphs 50(b), 
51(a), 56(h), and 56(k) of the First Amended Complaint in its motion for summary judgment. Id. Bell specifically disputes this 
characterization of its motion as to Paragraphs 56(h) and 56(k) in its reply. Bell Atlantic's Reply Memorandum in Support of its 
Motion for Summary Judgment (""Bell's Reply"") (Docket No. 108) at 1-2 & n.2. There is no Paragraph 51(a) in the First Amended 
Complaint. CTC's characterization of Bell's argument as to its claim for breach of contract based on Paragraph 50(b) in Count I 
is correct."
390,3," CTC has moved to strike Bell Atlantic Corporation's Local Rule 56 Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (""Bell's SMF"") 
(Docket No. 100), submitted in support of its motion for summary judgment as required by this court's Local Rule 56, on the 
ground that it fails to comply with the local rule in that it is composed of ""sweeping assertions liberally sprinkled with legal "
391,," opinions, legal conclusions, and legal argument, all of which are absolutely unsupported by any admissible evidence."" CTC's 
Motion to Strike Bell Atlantic's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (Docket No. 103) at 1. While there are many instances in 
which particular sentences or paragraphs among the unnumbered paragraphs in Bell's 19-page SMF do not meet the 
requirements of the local rule, striking the entire document is not the appropriate sanction. Where necessary, I will identify those 
portions of Bell's SMF upon which the court will not rely due to failure to meet the requirements of the local rule. I note that the 
court's task is made more difficult by the fact that CTC does not respond directly to any of the factual assertions in Bell's SMF, 
making it necessary for the court to compare every entry in CTC's 25-page Statement of Disputed Material Facts (Docket No. 
102) with every acceptable entry in Bell's SMF, a very time-consuming exercise in a case of the magnitude and complexity of 
this action. "
393,4," The offset provision of the agreement does not change this result. It does not create a condition precedent to payment of 
commissions; it simply gives Bell the right to set off amounts owed to it by CTC at the time Bell's payment is due to CTC. If Bell 
has not yet determined whether CTC owes it money from some previous transaction at the time a payment to CTC comes due 
under the agreement, it must wait to make a set-off at a later time when a payment to CTC is due and Bell has made the 
necessary determination concerning past overpayments, or that CTC owes it money for whatever other reason. The provision 
most certainly does not give Bell the right to delay paying commissions due to CTC indefinitely until Bell determines that CTC 
does or does not owe Bell money. "
394,5," The antitrust law upon which CTC's claims in Counts II and IV of its First Amended Complaint are based is found at 15 U.S.C. 
§ 1 et seq. and will often be referred to in this recommended decision as the Sherman Act."
394,6," CTC states that it ""will voluntarily dismiss"" Count III. CTC's Opposition at 4 n.1. That count has already been dismissed by the 
court. Affirming Order at 2. CTC also states that it ""will also voluntarily dismiss its claim concerning Bell Atlantic's reduction of 
wholesale discounts"" and ""its claim of sham litigation."" CTC's Opposition at 4 n.1. CTC may not simply voluntarily dismiss any of 
its claims at this stage of the action. Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a); D'Alto v. Dahon California, Inc., 100 F.3d 281, 283 (2d Cir. 1996). 
Taking CTC's statement as a motion to dismiss any claims raised in Paragraphs 41(i), 56(m), and 860) of its First Amended 
Complaint, see Bangor Baptist Church v. State, 92 F.R.D. 123, 125 (D. Me. 1981), I recommend that the court grant the motion. "
395,7," In its reply memorandum, Bell expands this argument to include ""imposition of 'unreasonable economic terms' on the sale of 
wholesale services,"" without specifying any paragraphs in the First Amended Complaint. Bell's Reply at 3. Bell's failure to include 
this claim in its initial motion deprived CTC of the opportunity to respond to Bell's state-action argument on this claim. As a result, 
the court will not consider Bell's motion for summary judgment on this claim on the basis of the state action doctrine. Grant v. 
News Group Boston, Inc., 55 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1995); In re One Bancorp Sec. Litig., 134 F.R.D. 4, 10 n.5 (D. Me. 1991). "
396,8," The Business Link program is not available in Vermont. Gordon Dec. P 21(b). Neither party appears to find this significant in 
connection with the state action issue. "
397,9," While I do not rely on them, I note that my conclusion is in accordance with those of the three state regulatory commissions that 
have ruled to date on this issue in proceedings initiated by CTC. Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, D.T.E. 98-18, 
Ruling dated July 2, 1998, Exh. HH to CTC's Opposition; New York Public Service Commission, Case 98-C-0426, Order 
Granting Petition effective September 14, 1998, enclosed in letter to the court from Rodger D. Young, Esq., dated October 23, 
1998 (""Young Letter""); New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission, DR 98-061, Order Permitting Assignment of Certain Retail 
Customers, Order No. 23,040, dated October 7, 1998, enclosed in Young Letter. Bell states, without evidentiary support, that the 
Massachusetts order has been stayed and Bell's petition for reconsideration by that agency granted. Bell's Reply at 7 n.7. "
398,10," Like the state action doctrine also invoked by Bell, the filed rate doctrine is plainly a creature of a different time. The Supreme Court has recognized that 'although the filing requirement prevented 
price discrimination and unfair practices' when AT&T held a monopoly in long-distance telecommunications, strict 
application of the filed rate doctrine 'frustrates those same goals' in today's era of deregulation and multiple competing 
carriers. MCI Telecomms. Corp. v. AT&T, 512 U.S. 218, 233, 129 L. Ed. 2d 182, 114 S. Ct. 2223 (1994). . . . In practice, as 
this case illustrates, the filed rate doctrine may lead to results that are quite unjust. But . . . this court is not the proper forum 
in which to resolve the problem. Unless and until Congress or the Supreme Court re-examines the doctrine, we are bound 
to enforce it. Fax, 138 F.3d at 491."
398,11," The ""FCC-tariffed"" services to which CTC refers are apparently ""carrier access services."" Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's 
Second Interrogatories to Plaintiff CTC Communications Corp., Exh. B to Bell's SMF, Answer 8 at 14. The intraLATA services 
listed in Paragraph 56(j) of the First Amended Complaint are not further defined in the summary judgment record and, unlike the "
399,," services in all of the other paragraphs subject to Bell's filed rate argument, are not separately addressed in Bell's written 
submissions. "
400,12," Bell's assertion that I recommended denial of its motion to dismiss on this ground ""because the state commissions rather than 
the FCC were the primary regulators here,"" Motion for Summary Judgment at 15 n.6, is incorrect. My analysis at that time quite 
clearly and carefully raised but did not resolve the question whether application of the primary jurisdiction doctrine is appropriate 
when the regulatory agency involved is a state agency rather than a federal one. Recommended Decision on Defendant's 
Motion to Dismiss (""Rec. Dec."") (Docket No. 46) at 10-12."
400,13," In its reply memorandum, Bell appears to extend its primary jurisdiction argument to include ""any remaining allegations of 
wrongful conduct under . . . the antitrust laws."" Bell's Reply at 7. The only subparagraphs of paragraphs 41 and 56 of the First 
Amended Complaint not addressed specifically in the motion for summary judgment or the court's order on Bell's motion to 
dismiss are Paragraphs 41(f) and 56(h) and (k). Bell argues that any allegations in Paragraph 56(k) should be ""dismissed"" 
because ""CTC's experts point to no injury either to competition or to CTC based on this conduct."" Id. at 2 n.2. This paragraph will 
accordingly be discussed in section III(B)(7), infra, in the context of Bell's more general argument to this effect. My conclusions 
set forth in this section apply equally to Paragraphs 41(f) and 56(h), which deal with Bell's alleged refusal to allow CTC to publish 
the fact that it has authority to market and resell Bell services. "
401,14," Bell's motion for summary judgment on CTC's claims under the Act will be discussed in section III(C), infra. "
402,15," For example, one of the allegations in the First Amended Complaint that Bell contends is subject to deferral under the primary 
jurisdiction doctrine is that Bell has refused to allow resellers to communicate directly with its technical personnel concerning the 
intraLATA communications services that the resellers have sold to end users. First Amended Complaint PP 41(g), 56(i). Bell has 
not suggested in any of its submissions in connection with this motion that such communication is a matter subject to filed tariffs 
or committed to administrative agency determination by statute. "
403,16," Bell also argues in passing that the testimony of CTC's experts is inadmissible under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm. Inc., 509 
U.S. 579, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469, 113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993), because those experts fail ""to take into account the central fact of this 
case: Bell Atlantic's nature as a pervasively regulated public utility."" Motion for Summary Judgment at 23 n.9. To the contrary, 
the testimony of CTC's experts that is presented in the summary judgment record meets the Daubert test for admissibility: the 
experts appear qualified, their testimony concerns specialized knowledge, and their testimony would assist the trier of fact. 
United States v. Shay, 57 F.3d 126, 132 (1st Cir. 1995). If the testimony in fact fails to take into account the fact that Bell is 
subject to regulation and if that fact is central to this case, those facts go to the weight of their testimony, not its admissibility. "
404,17," Bell's citation to authority for its argument that market share should be at most a point of departure in determining the 
existence of monopoly power in a regulated industry, Southern Pac. Communications Co. v. AT&T, 238 U.S. App. D.C. 309, 740 
F.2d 980, 1000 (D.C.Cir. 1984), does not affect this conclusion. First, Bell suggests that the remaining factors to be considered 
are the power to control prices or exclude competition. Bell's Reply at 10. CTC's experts offer testimony concerning their 
conclusions that Bell has excluded competition by engaging in the actions challenged by CTC. Second, Southern Pacific was 
decided twelve years before the Telecommunications Act of 1996 changed national policy to make competition in the provision 
of local telephone service a possibility as well as a goal. The nature of monopoly power must by definition be changed when the 
environment for the possible exercise of that power has changed so fundamentally."
404,18," Bell also seeks summary judgment on this basis on CTC's claims alleging a tying arrangement involving voice mail and 
Centrex. Motion for Summary Judgment at 29. This claim, set forth in Count III of the First Amended Complaint, has already 
been dismissed. Affirming Order at 2. "
405,19," Bell uses a figure of 3.4%, Motion for Summary Judgment at 28, but only 3% is supported by the authority cited by Bell, 
Goldberg's deposition testimony. "
406,20," One exception to this result might be the claim for disparagement set forth in Paragraph 56(k) of the First Amended Complaint, 
as to which Bell contends there is no evidence of injury either to competition or to CTC. Bells' Reply at 2 n.2. However, Bell 
failed to raise this issue in its initial motion, and, as previously noted, it is not entitled to summary judgment on the basis of an 
issue argued for the first time in its reply memorandum. Grant, 55 F.3d at 7."
406,21," Information concerning the New York action and the order issued in that case is set forth in this court's order granting CTC's 
motion to dissolve that order and denying Bell's motion for a permanent injunction. Decision on Motion to Dissolve TRO, etc. at 
1-2, 16-17, 19-20, 25-26. "
407,22," Bell's SMF includes a paragraph concerning Business Link customers and the use and availability of credits under this 
program, Bell's SMF at 13 [P 2], but it provides no citation to the summary judgment record to support the factual assertions it 
contains and thus may not be considered in support of its motion for summary judgment. See Pew v. Scopino, 161 F.R.D. 1, 1 
(D. Me. 1995); Donnell v. United States, 834 F. Supp. 19, 21 n.1 (D. Me. 1993). "
417,1," Plaintiff has since abandoned his defamation claim. Plaintiff's reply, p.7 n.11. "
418,2," For a summary of the content of these declarations, see Penner v. Breitling U.S.A., Inc., 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4816, 1996 WL 
182202 (N.D. Cal 1996); see also Order Denying Motion to Set Aside Summary Judgment in the Penner suit. (C 93-4308, July 1, 
1996). "
420,3," Plaintiff also suggests that the statement comes in as impeachment of Ms. Bodman. This argument lacks merit since nothing in 
Towey's declaration quotes, paraphrases, or even refers to statements made by Ms. Bodman."
420,4," Plaintiff seeks leave of the Court to depose Ms. Hoogasian and to seek financial documents from Saks and Shreves. Towey's 
declaration was dated March 1, 1996. Discovery was cut off on June 11, 1998. Plaintiff does not explain why he failed to depose 
Ms. Hoogasian or seek these documents prior to the discovery cut off date. Accordingly, the Court denies plaintiff's request."
420,5," Defendants ""categorically deny an admission of liability occurred during this meeting."" Breitling Reply Memo, p. 5. Questions of 
credibility, however, are not to be determined on summary judgment and the declaration will be assessed at face value. "
422,6," Breitling U.S.A. attempted to open a second store, Shreves, in December 1991. That venture, however, ended unsuccessfully 
when Shreves went bankrupt. Breitling U.S.A. subsequently opened Saks Fifth Avenue in May 1992."
422,7," Defendants deny the existence of such an agreement as a matter of fact, but concede it for purposes of defendants' motion for 
summary judgment. Breitling Reply Memo, p. 6."
422,8," HN16[
] Cal. Com. Code § 2306(2) describes Exclusive Dealings as ""[a] lawful agreement by either the seller or the buyer for exclusive dealing in the kind of goods concerned. . . ."" "
423,9," Reference to minimum annual purchase requirements is absent not only from the initial invoices, but from all of the writings 
between the parties. While the parties specifically referred to exclusivity in seven correspondences, no mention is made of 
minimum annual purchases at any dollar value at anytime by either party. Lasser Decl., Exh.E."
423,10," Plaintiff contends that defendants should be estopped from setting up the statute of frauds as a bar to recovery. HN20[
] 
Estoppel is appropriate ""where the defendant by his words or conduct represents that he proposes to stand by the oral contract, 
and the plaintiff, in reliance thereon, changes his position."" Witkin, Summary of California Law, 9th ed. § 322. To prevail on an 
estoppel argument, plaintiff must demonstrate either that (1) in reliance upon the oral agreement, plaintiff so changed his 
position that he suffered unconscionable injury or (2) defendant would be unjustly enriched by the non-enforcement of the oral 
agreement. Monarco v. Lo Greco, 35 Cal. 2d 621, 623-624, 220 P.2d 737 (1950). Aside from urging its application, plaintiff does not suggest why estoppel applies to the instant facts. Plaintiff's MPSJ, p.15. While 
plaintiff claims that he promoted the Breitling line and increased sales, the loss of exclusivity did not preclude plaintiff from 
continuing to sell Breitling watches to his new client base and profiting on those sales. Mozaffarian Decl. P 10. Plaintiff has not "
424,," provided any evidence to indicate that the loss of exclusivity harmed plaintiff to an extent that would constitute ""unconscionable 
injury."" Nor has plaintiff provided evidence to suggest that defendants were unjustly enriched by plaintiff's promotional efforts. 
Since plaintiff can show neither unconscionable injury nor unjust enrichment, plaintiff's estoppel argument fails."
424,11," Defendants also argue that even if an exclusivity agreement were enforceable between the parties, Breitling U.S.A. had good 
cause to cancel the agreement on account of plaintiff's consistent and well-documented failure to pay his bills in a timely 
manner. Although the parties dispute the precise credit terms, defendants argue that even under plaintiff's version of the credit 
arrangement, plaintiff's payments were consistently untimely. Breitling submitted compelling documentary evidence reflecting late payments. Lasser Decl., Exh.E; Bodman Decl. P 8 
(""Breitling records indicate that . . . for more than 80% of Shapur's total purchase orders (a total volume of about $ 109,000), he 
did not even pay a portion of the purchase price within ninety days from delivery."") Defendants also submitted correspondence 
between the parties in which Breitling U.S.A. complained with increasing impatience about the delinquency of plaintiff's 
payments. Lasser Decl., Exh.E; Mozaffarian Supp. Decl., Exh.D. Plaintiff submitted no business records, cancelled checks or accounting documentation to demonstrate that he paid in 
accordance with the credit terms of the alleged agreement. Rather, he offered a declaration which asserted that ""I made all 
payments on time pursuant to my agreement with Breitling,"" Mozaffarian Decl. P 9, and submitted correspondence showing that 
he paid some invoices with post-dated checks. Mozaffarian Decl., Exh.J. Finally, plaintiff submitted a spreadsheet of uncertain 
origin entitled ""the accounting of Breitling invoices in 1992"" to demonstrate that plaintiff paid all of his bills. Mozaffarian Supp. 
Decl. P 6. Breitling does not dispute that plaintiff eventually paid all of his bills on the Breitling account; it is the timeliness of the payments 
which is contested, and plaintiff submitted no documentary evidence supporting his position on that point. HN21[
] Under the 
UCC, plaintiff was obliged to pay in accordance with the credit arrangement. Cal. Com. Code § 2301. Chronically delinquent 
payments are a well-established basis for the cancellation of distributorship agreements. Camfield Tires, Inc. v. Michelin Tire 
Corp., 719 F.2d 1361, 1366 (8th Cir. 1983) (holding that defendant manufacturer was justified in canceling dealership agreement 
because plaintiff dealer maintained large overdue balances); Frigiking, Inc. v. Century Tire and Sales Co., Inc., 452 F. Supp. 
935, 938 (N.D. Tex. 1978) (same). The Court has serious doubts that plaintiff has ""set forth specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial"" on the question 
of the justifiability of termination based on late payments. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). The Supreme Court has cautioned that HN22[
] 
""the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on 
which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff."" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202, 106 
S. Ct. 2505 (1986). ""If the evidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted."" Id. 
at 249-250 (citations omitted). However, in light of the dispositive nature of the analysis of the statute of frauds in this case, the 
Court makes no finding on justifiable termination. "
436,1," Plaintiffs are Iron Workers Local Union No. 17 Insurance Fund, IBEW Local No. 38 Health & Welfare Fund, Ohio Laborers' 
District Council-Ohio Contractors' Association Insurance Fund, Dealers-Unions Insurance Fund, Local 47 Welfare Fund No. 1, 
Toledo Electrical Welfare Fund and their trustees."
436,2," Ohio-based multi-employer trust funds, by one estimate, pay health care costs of approximately 450,000 persons. The 
proposed class consists of all jointly-administered, multi-employer health and welfare trusts in Ohio and their respective trustees. 
The trust funds serve union members in industries, such as transportation and the building trades, where a unionist might have a 
series of employers throughout his or her career. See Doc. 153, Affidavit of Michael E. Withey. "

Marketing Co., Inc.; The Council for Tobacco Research - U.S.A., Inc.; The Tobacco Institute, Inc.; Hill & Knowlton, Inc.; and 
British-American Tobacco Co., Ltd. (""BATCo.""). On September 8, 1998, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed The Smokeless Tobacco Council, Inc. as a defendant in this case [Doc. 
237]. Further, by order entered September 14, 1998, this Court dismissed Defendant B.A.T. Industries, p.l.c. as a defendant in 
this case [Doc 238]."
437,4," On September 8, 1998, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed without prejudice certain claims. These include Count V (fraud), Count 
IX (unjust enrichment), and Count XII (violation of the Ohio Deceptive Trade Practices Act). Plaintiffs earlier withdrew Count VIII 
(breach of warranty), Count XIII (violation of ERISA), Count XVII (strict product liability), and Count XVIII (negligence), [See Doc. 
237]. On June 22, 1998, Plaintiff Funds also voluntarily dismissed certain claims based upon the ""regulatory enterprise."" These claims 
include Count II (violation of federalRICO, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962(a) and (d)); Count III (violation of federalRICO, 18 U.S.C. §§ 
1962(b) and (d)); Count XV (violation of Ohio RICO, § 2923.32(A)(3)); and Count XVI (violation of Ohio RICO, § 2923.32(A)(2)). 
See Doc. 134. Further, by order dated September 10, 1998, the Court dismissed Counts VI (intentional breach of special duty) 
and Count VII (negligent breach of special duty) [Doc. 234]. The five remaining claims in this case are: Count I (federalRICO, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and (d), except against Defendants 
Council for Tobacco Research, The Tobacco Institute, and Hill & Knowlton); Count IV (federal antitrust, 15 U.S.C. § 1, against all 
remaining defendants); Count X (state antitrust, Ohio Rev. Code § 1331 et seq., against all remaining defendants); Count XI 
(civil conspiracy against all remaining defendants); and Count XIV (Ohio RICO, Ohio Rev. Code § 2923.31 et seq., except 
against Defendants Council for Tobacco Research, The Tobacco Institute, and Hill & Knowlton)."
437,5," Plaintiffs' antitrust claims include one federal claim for violations of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., and one state law 
claim for violations of the Valentine Act, Ohio Rev. Code. § 1331.01 et seq. "
438,6," In that same opinion and order, the Court granted the motion to dismiss by Defendant B.A.T. Industries, p.l.c., as the Court 
found it lacked personal jurisdiction over this foreign corporation. "
439,7," In Klehr, the Supreme Court recognized the applicability of the fraudulent concealment doctrine specifically in civil RICO cases. 
The Court also noted the effect of the doctrine in antitrust cases, such as a comment that a plaintiff's behavior was not irrelevant 
to applying the doctrine ""to antitrust or to civil RICO."" 117 S. Ct. at 1993. The Court notes too that Congress ""consciously 
patterned civil RICO after the Clayton Act."" Id. at 1990. Therefore, this Court does not hesitate to discuss the fraudulent 
concealment doctrine in the context of plaintiffs' federal and state RICO claims. However, the Ohio Corrupt Activity Act claim 
also allows a claim ""at any time within five years after the unlawful conduct terminates or the cause of action accrues."""
439,8," See Section P, First Amended Complaint: ""Tolling of the Applicable Statutes of Limitation,"" including PP 252, 253 and 254. 
Paragraph 254 reads, in pertinent part: Until very recently, . . . Plaintiffs and members of the Class and their participants and beneficiaries could not reasonably 
have discovered the wrongdoing at any time prior to this time, nor could the Plaintiffs and members of the Class and their 
participants and beneficiaries have, as a practical matter, taken legally effective action given the unavailability, until very 
recently, of internal memoranda and other documents (as generally described herein) as evidence in support of their 
claims. Defendants have attempted and are continuing their attempts to keep such internal information from reaching 
Plaintiffs and members of the Class and their participants and beneficiaries. Indeed, Defendants still refuse to admit, and 
continue to conceal, the fact that using Defendants' tobacco products causes disease and that nicotine in Defendants' 
cigarettes is addictive. The cigarette manufacturers still refuse to admit that they have manipulated the level and delivery of 
nicotine in their cigarettes. First Amended Complaint at P 254."

. and I want Gummi Bears, and I like Gummi Bears, and I eat Gummi Bears, and I don't like it when I don't eat my Gummi 
Bears, but I'm certainly not addicted to them. Pl. Exh. 153 at 27."
444,31," Ohio Rev. Code § 2923.34(K) also allows a claim under the Ohio Corrupt Activity Act to be filed within five years of the time 
the cause of action accrues. That possibility provides for filing suit five years after the cause of action accrued. As applied to 
plaintiffs' federal RICO claim, it is unclear when the named plaintiffs discovered or should have discovered their RICO-type injury 
or injuries, and the date or dates on which the named plaintiffs knew or should have known of the ""pattern of racketeering."" The Court notes that the second limitations possibility, which closely resembles the rule for the federal RICO claim, has been 
used by other federal courts sitting in Ohio. See Baker v. Pfeifer, 940 F. Supp. 1168, 1181 (S.D. Ohio 1996); Cincinnati Gas & 
Elec. Co. v. General Elec. Co., 656 F. Supp. 49, 81 (S.D. Ohio 1986). However, these cases did not involve claims of an on-
going conspiracy, as are at issue in this litigation."
444,32," While the Court in Klehr rejected the so-called ""last predicate act"" rule because the plaintiffs' civil RICO claim could have been 
timely only under that rule, it did not decide the validity of the accrual rules applied by other circuits. 117 S. Ct. at 1989-91. See

445,33," The Eleventh Circuit panel in Bivens further explained its rationale by noting that ""the Supreme Court [had] described RICO as 
'an aggressive initiative to supplement old remedies and develop new methods for fighting crime.' The language of the statute, 
as well as 'Congress' self-consciously expansive language and overall approach' mandate that RICO is to be read broadly.

456,60," The Supreme Court rejected the defense in Hanover Shoe for two reasons: First, noting that a wide range of considerations 
may influence a company's pricing decisions, the Court concluded that establishing the amount of an overcharge shifted to 
indirect purchasers ""would normally prove insurmountable."" 392 U.S. at 493. The plaintiff initially would need to trace an 
overcharge's effects on the purchaser's prices, sales, costs and profits. Then, the plaintiff would need to show that ""in the real 
economic world rather than an economist's hypothetical model,"" these variables would have behaved differently absent the 
alleged overcharge.  Id. at 492-93. Second, the Court reasoned that a pass-on defense would reduce the effectiveness of 
actions brought under § 4 of the Clayton Act by diminishing the recovery available to any potential plaintiff. Id. at 494."
456,61," Once again, the Supreme Court reasoned that proof of pass-on in the ordinary case would add new dimensions of complexity

claims on statute of limitations grounds (Count IV and Count X, respectively) [Doc. 373]. The Court denied the remainder of 
defendants' summary judgment motions. The Court also dismissed Defendants Council for Tobacco Research, The Tobacco

511,9," Without an objection, plaintiffs sought additional time within which to respond to the motion to dismiss. On March 10, 1998, 
plaintiffs filed their opposition to plaintiffs' motion to dismiss. On March 20, 1998, defendants replied. Upon the defendants' 
request, the Court conducted a hearing on the motion to dismiss on July 15, 1998. "
512,10," In Holmes, more directly injured parties had already brought an action complaining of the same conduct. 503 U.S. at 273."
512,11," HN3[
] Effective December 1, 1998, Subd. (f) is added to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. That provision reads: (f) Appeals. A court of appeals may in its discretion permit an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying 
class action certification under this rule if application is made to it within ten days after entry of the order. An appeal does 
not stay proceedings in the district court unless the district judge or the court of appeals so orders. As noted, this provision only becomes effective on December 1, 1998. It has no direct bearing upon the class certification in this 
case that was granted on October 20, 1998. "
514,12," Defendants had also sought certification of whether the Plaintiff Funds had suffered antitrust injury and had standing to bring 
antitrust claims. Because this Court subsequently granted defendants' motion for summary judgment as to plaintiffs' antitrust 
claims, the request to certify this question is moot."
514,13," Plaintiffs say that all agree that Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268-70, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532, 112 
S. Ct. 1311 (1992), controls the issue of standing."
514,14," Commentary suggests that the language of § 1292 makes a distinction regarding the right to intermediate appeal on legal 
matters as opposed to matters involving questions of fact. For instance, Wright & Miller states: There is indeed no reason to suppose that interlocutory appeals are to be certified for the purpose of inflicting upon courts 
of appeals an unaccustomed and ill-suited role as factfinders. Even when the question is the supposed question of law 
whether there are any genuine issues of material fact that preclude summary judgment, ordinarily it seems better to keep 
courts of appeals aloof from interlocutory embroilment with the factual content of the record."

521,24," Defendants contest plaintiffs' damage model. Defendants say the model cannot be used to show either the named plaintiffs' 
damages or the damages of absent class members. No matter how this issue is decided, the plaintiffs have shown no other method for establishing damages. However this Court 
decides whether plaintiffs' damage model may be offered, the preparation and presentation of this case will remain common for 
all plaintiffs. "
525,*," The Honorable J. Thomas Marten, United States District Judge for the District of Kansas, sitting by designation. "
526,2," Southern Disposal alleges Defendants monopolized waste disposal in Choctaw County, but the contract at issue applied only 
to the City. The City of Hugo is the county seat of Choctaw County, Oklahoma."
526,3, Southern Disposal does not pursue any Commerce Clause claims on appeal. 
529,4," Interestingly, the Meder opinion also never specifically addresses or overrules Burns and Bishop. We do not believe the 
Oklahoma Supreme Court would overrule these prior decisions sub silentio. "
530,5," For purposes of our Fourteenth Amendment analysis, we assume Southern Disposal's claims are made only against the City 
as a ""state actor."" Appellant makes no attempt to show Texas Waste Management qualifies as a state actor and/or acted under 
color of state law. "
531,6," Even if we assume arguendo that Southern Disposal's pleadings did adequately state both Due Process and Equal Protection 
violations, we believe its claim would still fail constitutional scrutiny. Since no suspect class or fundamental right is involved in 
this instance, the City need only have a rational basis for its actions. See Jacobs, Visconsi & Jacobs, 927 F.2d at 1119. We find 
the exclusive contract with Texas Waste Management is reasonably related to the City's goal of providing waste disposal 
services to its residents, and therefore survives rational basis scrutiny. "
535,1," There is some debate over when (and whether) this promise was made. Dr. Johnson says it was made sometime prior to the 
start of her employment, but cannot remember whether it was made prior to her signing the employment contract. Dr. Johnson's 
husband, Dr. David Johnson, states in his deposition that the promise was made prior to Dr. Johnson's signing of the 
employment contract. Meanwhile, Dr. Fadel denies ever making such a promise."
535,2," In other words, if Dr. Johnson grossed less than this amount, UHS would make up the difference. "
536,3," The final decision was in the hands of UHS, which followed the recommendation of the obstetrics department."
536,4," Dr. Johnson also named as a defendant Hossam E. Fadel, M.D., P.C., the professional corporation through which Dr. Fadel 
operates his practice. For purposes of this opinion, there is no significant distinction between Dr. Fadel in his individual capacity 
and Dr. Fadel in his corporate capacity; we therefore refer to both defendants simply as ""Dr. Fadel."""
536,5," HN1[
] Because this case comes to us on appeal from a grant of summary judgment for defendants, (1) all facts are viewed, 
and all factual disputes are resolved, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff; and (2) we are to affirm if there is no genuine 
issue of material fact and the defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); Rayle Tech, Inc. v. 
DEKALB Swine Breeders, Inc., 133 F.3d 1405, 1409 (11th Cir.1998). "
537,6," This fact distinguishes our case from those on which Dr. Johnson relies, cases in which the defendant prevented the plaintiff 
from obtaining a necessary factor of production. See Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Tech. Serv., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 455, 112 S. 
Ct. 2072, 2076, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992) (defendant limited availability of necessary replacement parts); General Indus. Corp. v. 
Hartz Mountain Corp., 810 F.2d 795, 799 (8th Cir.1987) (defendant imposed harsh credit and supply restrictions); Multiflex v. 
Samuel Moore & Co., 709 F.2d 980, 987-88 (5th Cir.1983), disavowed on other grounds by Deauville Corp. v. Federated Dept. 
Stores, 756 F.2d 1183 (5th Cir.1985) (defendant impeded plaintiff's access to capital and customers)."
537,7," Dr. Johnson alleges that financial assistance from UHS is not extraordinary, but common. Although UHS does appear to have 
provided financial assistance to a number of physicians in the past, such financial assistance does not appear to be common in 
the amounts that Dr. Johnson seeks. Furthermore, Dr. Johnson has presented no evidence that a substantial number of 
physicians in Augusta needed hospital subsidization to allow them to enter the market, and thus that she has suffered any 
special injury as a result of UHS' actions. "
538,8," UHS' understanding of the contract is difficult to discern, because it denies ever having made any contract with Dr. Johnson."
538,9," HN7[
] Georgia law defines the doctrine of promissory estoppel as follows: ""A promise which the promisor should reasonably 
expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or 
forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise."" Ga.Code Ann. 13-3-44(a) (1998). "
539,10," As noted previously, see supra note 1, there is some debate over whether the promise was made before or after the 
employment contract was signed. If the promise was made afterwards, Dr. Johnson obviously could not have been expected to 
include it in the contract. Just as obviously, however, if the promise was made after the contract was signed, Dr. Johnson could 
not have acted in reliance on the promise when she signed the contract. Thus, she still would not have a valid fraud claim. "
540,11," Dr. Johnson also challenges the district court's ruling granting UHS' motion to strike certain evidence as hearsay. None of our 
holdings in this opinion are contingent on this evidence; we therefore reject this challenge as moot. "
550,1," By letter dated July 30, 1998, the court was informed that defendant had changed its name to DuPont Pharmaceuticals 
Company. "
551,2," Class plaintiff Steckel sued defendants DuPont Pharmaceutical Company, E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Company, and Merck & 
Company, Inc. For purposes of this memorandum opinion, these defendants shall be referred to in the singular."
551,3," Plaintiff notes in its complaint that the introduction of a generic alternative to a brand name product typically results in significant reduction in the brand name 
product's market share within the first year. The high level of a generic drug's market penetration is due to its lower cost, 
generic substitution laws, and preferred status in third-party reimbursement plans. (D.I. 1, P 15 (98 Civ. 1695)) "
552,4," Bioequivalence ""means the absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active 
moiety in pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives becomes available at the site of drug action when 
administered at the same molar dose under similar conditions in an appropriately designed study."" 29 C.F.R. § 320.1 (e) (1998)."
552,5," Plaintiff and class plaintiffs characterize this Petition for Stay as ""baseless"" and designed specifically to inflict competitive injury 
on plaintiff by forcing it to conduct time-consuming and costly studies before it could enter the oral anticoagulant market. (D.I. 1, 
P 68 (98 Civ. 1695); D.I. 1, P 33 (C.A. 97-659))"
552,6," HN1[
] In ruling on a motion to dismiss, a court may consider only the allegations contained in the complaint, exhibits 
attached thereto, and matters of public record. See 5A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure § 
1357 (2d ed. 1990). Where, as here, the parties have provided the court with undisputedly authentic regulatory documents, the 
court may consider them in reviewing a motion to dismiss. See City of Pittsburgh v. West Penn Power Co., 147 F.3d 256, 259 
(3d Cir. 1998); see also Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. White Consol. Indus., Inc., 998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir. 1993)."
552,7," Plaintiff further alleges that defendant's petitioning of the USP to narrow the content uniformity specifications for warfarin 
sodium tablets was ""an obvious attempt to impose stricter regulations on a new competitor"" designed to thwart plaintiff's entry 
into the oral anticoagulant market. (D.I. 1, PP 23, 24 (98 Civ. 1695)) "
553,8," Plaintiff contends that these ADE reports were rife with lies and mischaracterizations and were ""designed to defame plaintiff 
both at the FDA and in the marketplace."" (D.I. 13 at 13 (98 Civ. 1695)) Plaintiff alleges that some of these ADE reports did not 
even involve its generic warfarin sodium tablets. (D.I. 1, P 38 (98 Civ. 1695)) Plaintiff further claims that defendant solicited a 
large number of reports or reported events that the health care providers in question did not consider ""adverse events;"" indeed, 
many health care providers were unaware of being credited with ADE reports. (D.I. 1, PP 39, 41, 42 (98 Civ. 1695))"
553,9," Pharmacy benefit managers dictate which brands of pharmaceuticals will be dispensed to patients of managed care 
organizations and insurance companies. According to plaintiff, ""almost three-quarters of all the prescriptions dispensed in this 
country are affected by such third-party adjudication."" (D.I. 1, P 54 (98 Civ. 1695)) "
555,10," HN6[
] The Supreme Court has extended Noerr-Pennington immunity as well to the petitioning of nongovernmental bodies 
when they perform quasi-public duties. See Allied Tube & Conduit Corp. v. Indian Head, Inc., 486 U.S. 492, 100 L. Ed. 2d 497, 
108 S. Ct. 1931 (1988). The USP is a private entity, but it publishes the official compendium of pharmaceuticals in the United 
States. (D.I. 1, P 24 (98 Civ. 1695)) Since the USP promulgates standards governing pharmaceuticals (through procedures 
similar to those used by administrative agencies), the court will analyze the defendant's petition to the USP as it would a petition 
before an administrative agency."
555,11," Plaintiff argues the ""baselessness"" inquiry is inherently a question of fact and, therefore, inappropriate for resolution by the 
court. (D.I. 13 at 15 (98 Civ. 1695)) The Supreme Court, however, has found that HN9[
] a court may decide, as a matter of 
law, whether a party invoking Noerr-Pennington immunity had probable cause to bring an allegedly baseless suit. See PRE, 508 "
556,," U.S. at 63. A finding of probable cause ""compels the conclusion that a reasonable litigant in the defendant's position could 
realistically expect success on the merits of the challenged lawsuit."" Id. "
557,12," Plaintiff argues that the ""commercial exception"" to Noerr-Pennington immunity subjects defendant to antitrust liability for its 
misrepresentations to state legislatures that purchased pharmaceuticals for its citizens. Because neither the Second nor the 
Third Circuits have recognized the existence of this exception to Noerr-Pennington immunity and because the court has denied 
defendant's motion to dismiss on other grounds, the court declines to address the validity of plaintiff's ""commercial exception"" 
theory. "
560,13," Defendant's petitions to the FDA, the USP, and those state agencies that merely set standards governing the bioequivalency 
of generic drugs do not fall within this definition. Plaintiff has not alleged, nor could it, that any statements made to these 
regulatory bodies proposed a commercial transaction. "

Youngs Drug Prods. Corp., 463 U.S. 60, 64-65, 77 L. Ed. 2d 469, 103 S. Ct. 2875 (1983), because ""there is greater potential for 
deception or confusion in the context of certain advertising messages."" Id. at 65. Moreover, commercial speech is marked by 
""greater objectivity and hardiness . . . [which] may make it less necessary to tolerate inaccurate statements for fear of silencing 
the speaker."" Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 771 n.24, 48 L. Ed. 2d

564,15," Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides, in pertinent part, that HN29[
] ""any person who shall be injured in his business or 
property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court . . . and shall recover 
threefold the damages by him sustained. . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 15(a). "
577,1," Because the Court finds that defendants have pled facts sufficient to suggest the Soft Drink Act does not apply here, the Court 
need not address plaintiffs' argument that the Soft Drink Act preempts state law. "
578,2," The fact that the preliminary injunction issued by the New Jersey court was eventually dissolved does not in itself mean that the 
suit was ""objectively baseless."" See Real Estate, 508 U.S. at 60 n.5, 113 S. Ct. at 1928 n.5 (court must resist the temptation to 
engage in post hoc reasoning by concluding that an unsuccessful action must have been unreasonable). "
579,3," Defendants attempt to distinguish plaintiffs' authority by arguing they have alleged conduct, in addition to litigation activities, 
that violates state antitrust laws. However, their abuse of process claims seem to focus on plaintiffs' litigation activities. 
Counterclaim P 64. In addition, here the Court finds that it is the litigation activities alleged by defendants that are immune from 
liability, and addresses plaintiffs' other activities elsewhere in this order. "
582,1, The patent covering the needles was held invalid by the panel majority on the basis of 35 U.S.C. § 102(b). 
588,1," The Court will also be free to gauge the defendants' business justifications and the significance of nascent MRI providers that 
have applied to compete in a market that plaintiff thinks is anti-competitive. Although defendants noted these issues in their 
briefs, the facts can not be weighed at this time. "
604,1," The original Complaint named five plaintiffs. On September 23, 1998, the Court granted Plaintiffs' Motion to Delete Three 
Proposed Named Representatives. The remaining plaintiffs are Sally Bridges and Tammy Brady. "
605,2," Though captioned ""Plaintiffs' Cross Motion for Summary Judgment on Counts I & II,"" Plaintiffs clarified at oral argument that the 
Cross Motion is for summary judgment on Count I only."
605,3," Plaintiffs emphasize the ""exclusive"" nature of the contracts between Defendants and the schools receiving commissions. The 
Court observes that it is difficult to distinguish exclusive contracts from non-exclusive contracts in this context since it appears 
that in all schools, student portraits are taken once per year and only one studio takes portraits in each school in any given year. "
606,4," A large buyer demanding that a seller pay a fee to a designated broker who then gives the money to the buyer is an example of 
a ""dummy brokerage."" See Stephen Jay Photography, Ltd. v. Olan Mills, Inc., 903 F.2d 988, 992 n.6 (4th Cir. 1990)."
606,5,

] Commercial bribery"" is defined as ""the advantage which one competitor secures over fellow competitors by secret 
and corrupt dealing with employees or agents of prospective purchasers."" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 173 (5th ed. 1979). 
Commercial bribery within the reach of [§ 13(c)] takes place when a person who purports to be an agent or fiduciary for one 
party to a transaction receives, for his or her own account and contrary to the interests of his or her principal, commissions 
or value from the other party to the transactions. 3 E. KINTNER, FEDERAL ANTITRUST LAW S 26.12, at 528 (1983). Keller W. Allen & Meriwether D. Williams, Commercial Bribery, Antitrust Injury and Section 2(c) of the Robinson-Patman Anti-
Discrimination Act, 26 Gonz. L. Rev. 167 (1990/1991)."
607,6," One early First Circuit case discussing 15 U.S.C. § 13(c) indicates that any commission paid to an agent of one party by the 
other party is a violation of the statute, even if the payment is for services rendered. See Quality Bakers of America v. FTC, 114 
F.2d 393, 398 (1st Cir. 1940) (""It is plain enough that the paragraph, taken as a whole, is framed to prohibit the payment of 
brokerage in any guise by one party to the other, or the other's agent, at the same time expressly recognizing and saving the 
right of either party to pay his own agent for services rendered in connection with the sale or purchase""). Neither party has cited 
Quality Bakers, however, and the Court finds that the case does not reflect the modern interpretation of the law, which is that a 
party may pay a commission to the other party's agent as long as it is for services rendered by that agent to the party paying the 
commission. See Rangen, Inc., 351 F.2d at 859 (noting that ""emasculation of the services rendered exception [found in Quality 
Bakers] has been criticized as unduly hindering legitimate brokerage"")."
607,7," Many courts have found that no competitive injury is necessary to establish a violation of 15 U.S.C. § 13(c). See FTC v. 
Simplicity Pattern Co., 360 U.S. 55, 65, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1079, 79 S. Ct. 1005 (1959) (proscriptions of [13(c)] are ""absolute"" and do 
not require showing of competitive injury); Metrix Warehouse, Inc. v. Daimler-Benz Aktiengesellschaft, 716 F.2d 245, 247 (4th 
Cir. 1983) (""nothing in the language of [13(c)] . . . requires proof of an adverse effect on competition before a violation may be 
found""); Environmental Tectonics, 847 F.2d at 1066; Rangen, Inc., 351 F.2d at 858; In re American Honda Motor Co., Inc., 941

WL 543088, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 3, 1997). Courts are divided, however, on whether a competitive injury is necessary to confer standing on a private party asserting a 
violation under 15 U.S.C. § 13(c) as required by 15 U.S.C. § 15(a) which provides a private right of action for ""any person . . . 
injured by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws."" See Environmental Tectonics, 847 F.2d at 1066 (""A private plaintiff 
does not have to prove price discrimination to recover for a violation of [§ 13(c)], but the plaintiff must still meet the standing 
requirements to proceed""); Larry R. George Sales Co. v. Cool Attic Corp., 587 F.2d 266, 270-72 (5th Cir. 1979) (""Recovery and 
damages under the antitrust law is available to those who have been directly injured by the lessening of competition and is 
withheld from those who seek the windfall of treble damages because of incidental harm""); Federal Paper Bd. Co. v. Amata, 693 
F. Supp. 1376, 1389 (D. Conn. 1988) (finding buyer had no standing to assert commercial bribery claim where only injury was 
that buyer paid higher price for goods than it otherwise would have); Bunker v. Ramo Corp. v. Cywan, 511 F. Supp. 531 (N.D. Ill. 
1981); Hansel ' N Gretel Brand, Inc., 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13324, 1997 WL 543088, at *8. But see Seaboard Supply Co. v. 
Congoleum Corp., 770 F.2d 367 (3rd Cir. 1985) (omitting examination of standing in considering commercial bribery claim where 
plaintiff had not alleged antitrust injury); Metrix Warehouse, Inc., 716 F.2d at 247; Municipality of Anchorage v. Hitachi Cable, 
Ltd., 547 F. Supp. 633, 639 (D. Alaska 1982) (""when commercial bribes are paid to a company's employees to obtain contracts "

Motor Corp., 630 F. Supp. 902, 909 (E.D.N.Y. 1986). Here, Plaintiffs allege that they were injured by paying a higher price for school photographs than they would have paid absent 
the commission. Though Plaintiffs were injured, it is not at all clear that the paying of higher prices by customers is the sort of 
injury to competition sufficient to establish a violation of § 13(c) or to confer standing to bring an antitrust action. See Allen Pen 
Co., Inc. v. Springfield Photo Mount Co., 653 F.2d 17 (1st Cir. 1981) (indicating that plaintiff must ""establish injury because [§ 
13(c)] is designed to prevent violation of the basic [§ 13(a)] price discrimination prohibition under different guise,"" but not 
discussing standing). Since neither party has raised or briefed these issues, and because the Court finds several substantive 
deficiencies in Plaintiffs' § 13(c) claim, the Court declines to decide these questions."
608,8," The present case can be distinguished from Burge v. Bryant Pub. Sch. Dist., 520 F. Supp. 328 (E.D. Ark. 1980), aff'd, 658 F.2d 
611 (8th Cir. 1981), in which district and appellate courts found that a photographer paid commissions to schools for services 
rendered to him by the schools. While the services rendered in Burge were similar to those provided by the schools in the case 
at bar, there was no evidence, as there is here, that schools which did not receive commissions also provided similar services. Likewise, in Stephen Jay Photography, Ltd. v. Olan Mills, Inc., 713 F. Supp. 937 (E.D. Va. 1989), where the district court found 
that schools had rendered services to photography studios in exchange for commissions, there was no evidence concerning 
services provided by schools which did not receive commissions. The Fourth Circuit declined to address this issue on appeal. 
See Stephen Jay Photography, Ltd., 903 F.2d 988 (4th Cir. 1990). "
609,9," The Court has not found, nor have the parties cited, one case which discusses the meaning of the term ""purchase"" in the 
Nonprofit Institutions Act. The interpretation adopted by the Court in the present case is consistent with the purpose of the Act to 
""permit institutions which are not in business for profit to operate as inexpensively as possible."" Logan Lanes, Inc., 378 F.2d at 
216. "
610,10," To the extent that ""secrecy is an essential element"" of a commercial bribery claim, Stephen Jay Photography, Ltd. v. Olan 
Mills, Inc., 713 F. Supp. 937, 941 (E.D. Va. 1989), the Court observes that Defendants have expressly notified parents of their 
arrangement with the schools receiving commissions since 1996. Even prior to 1996, however, Plaintiffs were not obligated to 
buy photos from Defendants at the commission price or any price."
610,11," Defendants correctly describe Plaintiffs' claim as alleging a ""primary line injury."" The term ""primary-line injury"" refers to injury 
to direct competitors of the discriminating seller. See Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 
220, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168, 113 S. Ct. 2578 (1993). In this case, Plaintiff claims that other photography studios are injured by 
Defendants' price discrimination. In contrast, ""secondary-line injury"" is injury to competition among retailers or wholesalers 
buying from the discriminating seller. See Jefferson County Pharmaceutical Ass'n, v. Abbott Laboratories, 460 U.S. 150, 178 n.6, 
74 L. Ed. 2d 882, 103 S. Ct. 1011 (1983) (O'Connor, J., dissenting). "
611,12," There also is no question that all schools are offered the same opportunity to designate Defendants as the exclusive providers 
of student portraits on school grounds in exchange for a commission. Thus, there can be no claim of price discrimination as to 
the schools to the extent that they are regarded as purchasers."
611,13," The Court finds it unnecessary to consider Defendants' claim that their pricing structure was merely a ""good faith effort to meet 
competition"" pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 13(b) because it finds Defendants' other arguments dispositive. "
612,14," Local Rule 56 provides in relevant part: The papers opposing a motion for summary judgment shall be accompanied by a separate, short and concise statement of 
material facts, supported by appropriate record citations, as to which it is contended that there exist a genuine issue to be 
tried. All material facts set forth in the statement required to be served by the moving party, if supported by appropriate 
record citations, will be deemed to be admitted unless properly controverted by the statement required to be served by the 
opposing party. D. Me. R. 56. "
633,1," Trump and THCR (collectively ""Trump"") joined in one motion, and Hilton filed a separate motion to dismiss. "
634,2," The relevant funding statutes include the Casino Control Act of 1977 and the Municipal Landfill Site Remediation and 
Redevelopment Act of 1996 (the ""Remediation Act"") (Compl. PP 30-33.) Under the Casino Control Act, New Jersey imposes 
upon casino licensees an investment alternative tax, which can be reduced by purchasing certain investment bonds. (Id. P 30.) 
Monies raised by sale of the investment bonds are used by New Jersey to fund development projects throughout the state. (Id.) 
The Casino Control Act also imposes a fee of $ 1.50 for each charge made for the use of a casino-hotel parking space. These 
fees are also used by the State of New Jersey for economic development of Atlantic City and its surrounding areas. (Id. P 31.) 
Under the Remediation Act, Plaintiff may be able to recover up to 75% of the clean-up costs associated with development of the 
H-Tract. (Id. P 33.) This legislation provides developers who remediate landfills with a rebate of half of the sales tax generated 
by the new development. (Id.) "
636,3," In Kramer, plaintiff was an owner of an unauthenticated Jackson Pollack painting, who sued Sotheby's, Christie's and the 
Pollack-Krasner Foundation after the auction houses refused to sell his painting without authentication. Plaintiff claimed that 
defendants conspired to limit the number of Pollack paintings on the market, so that they could increase the value of their own 
Pollack paintings. The court found that the art houses had an independent interest in not selling forgeries, and that Defendants 
would have been disadvantaged from creating a monopoly market for Pollack paintings, since they would profit far more from an 
increased number of sales that would occur in an open market. Kramer, 890 F. Supp. at 256."
636,4," Because the Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged injury to competition under the rule of reason analysis, the Court 
will not decide whether Defendants' conduct constituted a ""per se"" antitrust violation. "
637,5," The Court finds, and the parties agree, that New Jersey law applies to both state law claims. Under New York choice of law 
principles, which this Court relies upon when adjudicating state law claims, this Court must look to the locus of the tort to 
determine which state law to apply. Krock v. Lipsay, 97 F.3d 640, 645 (2d Cir. 1996). Since New Jersey was the locus of these 
torts, the Court will apply that state's law."
637,6," In the tortious interference context, ""malice"" is defined as inflicting harm intentionally and without justification or excuse. 
Printing Mart-Morristown, 116 N.J. 739, 563 A.2d 31, 37 (N.J. 1989). "
638,7," New Jersey courts have referred to the Restatement in tortious interference claims. See Printing Mart-Morristown, 563 A.2d at 
37 (analyzing the similarities between the Restatement and New Jersey standards for tortious interference); MacDougall v. 
Weichert, 144 N.J. 380, 677 A.2d 162, 174 (N.J. 1996) (adopting the Restatement's balancing test for determining malice). "
649,1," Evidence was taken on October 14, 15, 19 and 20, 1998 and post-hearing argument was held on October 28, 1998."
649,2," Programs written in the JAVA language, developed and licensed by Sun Microsystems, are exceptions. JAVA is designed to 
allow ISVs to write application programs that can be used on more than one operating system. "
650,3, MS/DOS was the original operating system offered for IBM personal computers.
650,4," ""UNIX"" is a core of technology originally developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories. There are various versions of the UNIX system, 
as well as other, non-Windows operating systems such as Open VMS and IBM's OS/390, to which Bristol's product can translate 
Windows applications. For convenience, the court will use ""UNIX"" or ""UNIX-based"" to refer to all of these operating systems."
650,5," Wind/U was offered in two ways. Bristol developed a software development kit for Windows software application developers. 
This product allows a particular Windows program to run on UNIX. Bristol also offers a Wind/U product, which, when installed on 
a UNIX-based operating system, enables that system to run any Windows application."
650,6," ""Source code"" is the computer program as written by the programmer. It includes both logic, expressed in algebraic-like 
equations or human readable words, and ""comments"" which are human language text written to provide understandable 
descriptions of the intent of the program's logic. Because operating systems have different APIs, source code is needed to 
create an effective cross-platform product."
650,7, WISE is an acronym for Windows Interface Source Environment.
650,8," In 1993, shipments of new UNIX operating systems represented 23.6% of shipments in the server market and 94% in the 
workstation market. Comparable Microsoft figures were 0.7% and 0.1%."
650,9," ""Version release"" and ""update release"" were defined in the contract as a change in the product designation number to the right 
of the decimal period, in the tenths and hundredths digits respectively. For example, a version release of Windows 3.1 would be 
designated as Windows 3.2, whereas an update release would be designated as Windows 3.11."
650,10," A product release is indicated by a change in the product designation number in the units digit to the left of the decimal. For 
example, if the current product release were designated as Windows 3.1, then a new product release would be designated as 
Windows 4.0. "
651,11," For ease of discussion, reference will generally be made to NT 5 because it has been the primary focus of the hearing. The 
court recognizes, however, that plaintiff also seeks access to existing NT 4 source code."
651,12," When so packaged, the Bristol product can run all Windows applications loaded onto the UNIX system."
651,13," Microsoft offered, e.g., a royalty rate of $ 100 per system, up from the $ 25 per system provided in the 1994 contract."
651,14, The Order proposed by Bristol is attached to its Motion [Dkt. # 3].
651,15," There is conflicting evidence in the record regarding the release date. It is the conclusion of this court that, at this time, the 
release date is likely to be toward the end of 1999. "
652,16," The heightened standard is also applicable if the injunction will provide the moving party with substantially all the relief he 
seeks and the relief cannot be undone if the movant fails to prevail on the merits. Tom Doherty, 60 F.3d at 33-34. Because of 
this court's conclusion that the relief sought is mandatory, it will not address the issue of whether the heightened standard is also 
called for under the second criteria."
652,17," Although the disjunctive ""or"" is used, the standard is met only when both requirements are satisfied. See Abdul Wali, 754 F.2d 
at 1026 (""Accordingly we hold that the prisoners must show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, i.e., that their 
cause is considerably more likely to succeed than fail (together, of course, with the requisite irreparable injury)."") (emphasis 
added)."
652,18," Although both ""clear"" and ""substantial"" have been used to describe the level of proof, they have the same meaning in this 
context. Tom Doherty, 60 F.3d at 34. "
653,19," The court does not mean to suggest that a loss of merely some business would meet the irreparable harm standard. HN8[
] 
A loss of substantially all its business is required. See Jack Kahn Music Co., 604 F.2d at 762-63. The court finds such a situation 
to exist in this case."
653,20," Bristol will continue to earn revenue from Wind/U royalties for some period, but it is insufficient to sustain its business. The 
likely precipitous drop in revenues from Wind/U is reflected in the decline in the number of potential customers engaging in an 
""evaluation"" or a trial run of the product. For example, nineteen potential customers evaluated Wind/U in August 1997; only three 
potential customers did so in August 1998. Because over 95% of Bristol's new sales come from customers who have first 
evaluated the software, the number of evaluations serves as a leading indicator of Bristol's sales."
653,21," Microsoft has already released preliminary versions of NT 5 source code to ISVs so that the ISVs can begin to develop NT 5 
application programs. It is Microsoft's expectation that over 60,000 such applications for NT 5 will be on the market when it is 
released. Within 18 months of release, it is further estimated that there will be 100,000 applications for NT 5. There were 45 
applications that could run on Windows 95 when it was released. "
654,22," In this opinion, the court sometimes shortens this standard to ""a clear showing"" with regard to an issue. It is intended that this 
should be read as ""a clear showing of a likelihood of prevailing at trial"" on that issue."
654,23," The court assumes for purposes of this discussion that an antitrust violation has occurred. National Assoc. of Pharmaceutical 
Mfrs., Inc. v. Ayerst Labs, 850 F.2d 904, 914 (2d Cir. 1988). "
655,24," Associated General Contractors outlines these antitrust standing requirements for claims brought under Section 4 of the 
Clayton Act, which are more comprehensive than the standing requirements for Section 16 claims. See Cargill, 479 U.S. at 111 
n.6. (""Because standing under § 16 raises no threat of multiple lawsuits or duplicative recoveries, some of the factors other than 
antitrust injury that are appropriate to a determination of standing under § 4 are not relevant under § 16.""). In the underlying claim, Bristol seeks both treble damages under Section 4 and injunctive relief under Section 16 of the Clayton 
Act. It must make a clear showing that it at least has standing to bring its Section 16 claim to prevail on the preliminary injunction 
motion presently before the court. Because the court finds that Bristol has met the more stringent requirements for a Section 4 
damage case, it has clearly demonstrated that it has standing for purposes of the equitable relief sought in its motion for a 
preliminary injunction under Section 16. "
656,25," As part of its argument, Microsoft contends that Bristol cannot be Microsoft's competitor because, if it is, then all companies 
that write software are Microsoft's competitors. See Declaration of Richard L. Schmalensee at P 16. However, not all software 
enables an operating system, like UNIX, to run applications written for a different operating system. It is this aspect of the 
Wind/U product that makes Bristol a competitor of Microsoft as a seller of operating systems."
656,26," Microsoft's own internal communications reflect its view of Bristol as a ""competitor"" and acknowledge the risk that cross-
platforms, like Wind/U, pose to the success of the NT operating system in the workstation and server markets. Specifically, the 
cross-platform capacity of Wind/U threatens to strengthen the market appeal of UNIX and to neutralize the competitive 
functionality NT 5 would offer over UNIX. Clearly, Microsoft recognized the potential of Bristol, through its Wind/U sales to 
makers of UNIX operating systems and their users, to lessen Microsoft's sales. See Hayden Pub. Co. v. Cox Broadcasting 
Corp., 730 F.2d 64, 71 (2d Cir. 1984)."
656,27, See supra note 23. 
657,28," Microsoft cites four circuit court decisions in support of its argument that Bristol must show an actual, market wide adverse 
effect on competition, and not just harm to itself, to establish antitrust injury: Tops Markets, Inc. v. Quality Markets, Inc., 142 F.3d 
90, 96-97 (2d Cir. 1998); Electronics Communication Corp. v. Toshiba Am. Consumer Products, Inc., 129 F.3d 240 (2d Cir. 
1997); Balaklaw v. Lovell, 14 F.3d 793 (2d Cir. 1994); and TransSport, Inc. v. Starter Sportswear, Inc., 964 F.2d 186, 190-91 (2d 
Cir. 1992). The first three are cited for their discussions of the requirements of a Sherman Act Section 1, not Section 2, cause of 
action. The fourth case cited, TransSport, although a Section 2 case, is concerned at the pages cited with the issue of whether 
the defendant's conduct was an unreasonable exercise of its monopoly power, not with antitrust injury. Therefore, these cases 
are inapposite to the analysis here."
657,29," This section and the one that follows discuss Bristol's claims under Section 2 of the Sherman Act (the First through Sixth 
Claims). Because the Connecticut Antitrust Statute, Conn. Gen. Stat. § 35-27, mirrors the federal anti-monopoly statute, Shea v. 
First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n of New Haven, 184 Conn. 285, 303-04, 439 A.2d 997 (1981), the analysis in these sections is also 
applicable to Bristol's state law antitrust claims (the Seventh through Twelfth Claims)."
657,30," In its Fourth Claim, Bristol alleges a violation of Section 2 based on the theory that Microsoft's refusal to deal constituted denial 
of access to an essential facility. Complaint at PP 80-85. Bristol does not press that claim as a ground upon which to rest the 
issuance of a preliminary injunction. See Bristol's Summary of Proof at 4. Therefore, the court will not address that claim at this 
time."
657,31, It is uncontested that the geographic scope of each product market is worldwide.
657,32, See Testimony and Declaration of Professor Langlois. 
658,33," Microsoft announced on October 27, 1998 that NT 5 will be renamed Windows 2000 at release and that it is Microsoft's 
intention that NT 5/Windows 2000 will serve as the basis for all Microsoft PC operating systems ""from consumer products to the 
highest-performance servers."" Given that NT 5/Windows 2000 is expected to have greater capabilities than current Microsoft 
products, there may well be only one market in the future."
658,34," It is not altogether clear whether the doctrine has survived the Supreme Court's decision in Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. 
McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 122 L. Ed. 2d 247, 113 S. Ct. 884 (1993) and the Second Circuit's decision in Twin Labs., Inc. v. 
Weider Health & Fitness, 900 F.2d 566 (2d Cir. 1990). Although Spectrum Sports did not address the monopoly leveraging 
doctrine directly, the Court rejected the concept that Section 2 could ever be implicated without actual monopolization or a 
dangerous probability thereof.  Spectrum Sports, 506 U.S. at 459 (""[HN18[
] Section] 2 makes the conduct of a single firm unlawful only when it actually monopolizes or dangerously threatens to do so."") (emphasis added). Similarly, the Second 
Circuit's opinion in Twin Labs, while not explicitly overruling Berkey Photo, described part of the decision as ""dictum."" Further, 
Twin Labs could be read to suggest that a plaintiff in a monopoly leveraging claim must demonstrate ""tangible harm to 
competition"" in order to prevail. Twin Labs., 900 F.2d at 570-71. Because Bristol has not made a clear showing of success on 
the merits under the more favorable Berkey Photo standard, this court need not at this time resolve the question of whether 
Berkey Photo has been limited by Twin Labs or overruled sub silentio by Spectrum Sports. "
659,35," Bristol has acknowledged that Windows is far and away the single most attractive choice for an ISV. Bristol's Post-Trial 
Summary of Proof at 14."
659,36," Bristol also argues that it is unlawful under Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467, 
105 S. Ct. 2847 (1985), for a monopolist in one market ""to refuse to continue a pro-competitive arrangement"" in another. Bristol's 
Post-Trial Summary of Proof at 34-35. In essence, Bristol's theory of liability combines the monopoly leveraging doctrine of 
Berkey Photo with the ""refusal to deal"" liability of Aspen Highlands. No court has so extended the monopoly leveraging doctrine. 
Particularly in light of the recent doubt cast on Berkey Photo, see supra note 34, this court declines to be the first to do so."
659,37," Monopoly power may also be proven by direct evidence that prices were controlled or that someone was excluded from the 
market. Tops Markets, Inc. v. Quality Markets, Inc., 142 F.3d 90, 98 (2d Cir.1998). At this preliminary injunction stage, no such 
evidence has been adduced. "
660,38," For example, as of December 1997, Microsoft estimated that it had already spent $ 270 million in developing the NT 5 product 
version. Since that time, 2,000 developers have continued to work on the product."
660,39," Operating systems involve technical standards on which the production of a wide array of complementary products depends. 
The value to any one user of a standard depends on the number of others who also adopt that standard. A standard that attracts 
a critical mass of users can gain sufficient momentum to drive out competing candidates and to establish itself as dominant. 
When network effects of this sort are present, users face high costs of switching away from a dominant standard."
660,40," Further supportive of the conclusion that Bristol has not clearly shown that Microsoft has monopolized these markets are the 
various predictions in the trade press that UNIX-based systems will continue to compete vigorously with Microsoft in these 
markets for the foreseeable future. These predictions were credited by the defendant's expert, Dr. Schmalensee. Several 
exhibits contain similar opinions by Bristol representatives."
660,41, Bristol has also asserted parallel state law claims. Complaint at PP 108-13. See supra note 29. 
661,42," Microsoft's CEO refers to this phenomenon as a ""success loop."""
661,43," The continued vitality of UNIX also raises doubt about the existence of a dangerous probability that Microsoft will achieve 
monopoly power in these two markets. See supra note 40. "
662,44," In light of this conclusion, this court need not address whether Bristol has clearly shown a specific intent to monopolize and 
anticompetitive or predatory conduct."
662,45," In its Reply Memorandum, Bristol suggests that the court should adopt the less stringent standard articulated in the 
Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 872 and 894 for purposes of deciding whether the promise made by Microsoft is sufficient to 
require Microsoft to renew the 1994 WISE agreement on similar terms. Section 872 of the Restatement deals with tortious acts 
committed in reliance on misrepresentations regarding the ownership or disposition of property for which the person making 
such misrepresentations is subject to liability as if the statements were true. Section 894 provides a defense for a non-tortious 
act committed in reliance on misrepresentations of fact. Without deciding whether these sections are relevant to Bristol's claims, 
the court declines to apply these Restatement standards given that Bristol has not cited, nor has the court been able to find, any 
Connecticut appellate cases adopting them. "
663,46," Bristol has pled a violation based on various ""unfair"" acts. Because it has not pleaded that Microsoft's acts were also 
deceptive, this court's analysis will focus only on the question of unfairness under CUTPA. "
664,47," Although this case concerned Section 5 of the FTC Act rather than CUTPA, essentially the same criteria have been used 
under both statutes to evaluate whether an act is ""unfair."" HN40[
] Conn. Gen. Stat. § 42-110b(b) (""In construing [CUTPA], . . . the courts of this state shall be guided by interpretations given by the Federal Trade Commission and the federal courts to 
Section 5(a)(1) of the [FTCA], as from time to time amended."")."
664,48," These cases are all appeals from administrative proceedings before the FTC. It has been suggested that extending the FTC 
Act in this way is appropriate. The policy bases for such an extension of the FTC Act relate to the fact that the FTC Act is enforceable only through an 
administrative process and not through private actions. Thus, one may assume the following: (1) that the agency possesses 
administrative expertise; (2) that the agency will proceed with a sense of broad public interest and not for individual 
interests; and (3) remedies under the FTC Act are likely to be more limited than under the antitrust law. This third factor 
seems significant because the more substantial antitrust remedies would not appear to be justifiable for marginal violations 
of law."
664,1," Langer, Morgan & Belt, The Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act 24 (1994). However, unlike the FTC Act, CUTPA is 
actionable by private parties, with remedies equivalent to those available under the antitrust laws. Conn. Gen. Stat. § 42-110g. The court will analyze whether, on the record before it, the plaintiff has clearly shown a likelihood of success in establishing a 
""marginal"" antitrust violation, without deciding at this time that such a cause of action is viable under CUTPA."
664,49," Although it was responding to Microsoft's request, Bristol did submit a list of less than all NT 5 source code that it stated it 
would accept in a new contract. A finder of fact could conclude from this that, at least at one time, it was Bristol's view that not all 
source code was needed to compete. "
674,*," The Honorable Clifford Scott Green, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation. "
678,1," The statute at issue in Bennet, the Endangered Species Act of 1973, Pub. L. No. 93-205, 87 Stat. 884 (codified as amended in 
scattered sections of 16 U.S.C.), provides: (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection any person may commence a civil suit on his own behalf-- (A) to enjoin any person, including the United States and any other governmental instrumentality or agency (to the extent 
permitted by the eleventh amendment to the Constitution), who is alleged to be in violation of any provision of this chapter 
or regulation issued under the authority thereof; or . . . . . . . . (C) against the Secretary where there is alleged a failure of the Secretary to perform any act or duty under section 1533 of 
this title which is not discretionary with the Secretary. The district courts shall have jurisdiction, without regard to the amount 
in controversy or the citizenship of the parties, to enforce any such provision or regulation, or to order the Secretary to 
perform such act or duty, as the case may be . . . ."
678,16, U.S.C. § 1540(g) (1994).
678,2," Although the Court in Associated General did not make explicit findings regarding whether Congress expressly negated 
background prudential standing doctrine, the Court has subsequently cited Associated General for precisely that proposition. 
See Bennett, 117 S. Ct. at 1162 (citing Associated General for the proposition that Congress legislates against the background 
of prudential standing doctrine unless it is expressly negated). We discuss Associated General at greater length in Section II(C) 
of this opinion. "
679,3," The quoted portion of § 45 has not been altered since the Lanham Act was enacted in 1946. See Pub. L. No. 489, reprinted in 
1946 U.S.C.C.A.N. 412, 429. "
680,4," Though § 43(a) was modified after the Thorn decision, the operative language defining the class of persons entitled to bring a 
private damages action has not undergone substantive change. See Thorn, 736 F.2d at 931 (quoting the then-existing § 43(a): "
681,," ""Section 43(a) provides that an action may be brought 'by any person doing business in the locality falsely indicated as that of 
origin or in the region in which said locality is situated, or by any person who believes that he is or is likely to be damaged by the 
use of any such false description or representation.' "")."
681,5," This analysis rests upon an earlier version of § 43(a), which, unlike the present statute enacted in 1992, appeared to create two 
classes of parties with standing to sue. The earlier version of the statute provided that an action could be brought by any person doing business in the locality falsely indicated as that of origin or in the region in which said locality is 
situated, or by any person who believes that he is or is likely to be damaged by the use of any such false description or 
representation."
681,15," U.S.C. § 1125(a) (1988) (emphasis added). The text of the present statute, which is quoted earlier in our opinion, does not 
differentiate textually between the standing of ""false designation"" plaintiffs and others to bring suit. "
682,6," But see L.S. Heath & Son, Inc. v. AT & T Info. Sys., Inc., 9 F.3d 561, 575 (7th Cir. 1993) (""Because Heath is not in the 
computer business and thus is not a competitor of AT&T, Heath does not have standing to raise the false advertising claim.""); 
Stanfield v. Osborne Indus., Inc., 52 F.3d 867, 872 (10th Cir.) (""To have standing for a false advertising claim, the plaintiff must

682,7," A ""false association"" claim refers to false representations concerning the origin, association, or endorsement of goods or 
services through the wrongful use of another's distinctive mark, name, trade dress, or other device.  Waits v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 
978 F.2d 1093, 1108 (9th Cir. 1992)."

698,2," Individual complaints naming Playmobil as Defendant were filed as: (1) Clark v. Playmobil, filed in the Southern District of 
Florida, under docket number 2: 96-14002, and upon MDL transfer assigned docket number 96-CV-3937; (2) Mortensen v. 
Playmobil, filed in the District of New Jersey, under docket number 2: 96-109, and upon MDL transfer assigned docket number 
96-CV-3938; and (3) Steffen v. Playmobil, filed in this District under the now consolidated docket number 96-CV-2896."
698,3," It is important to note that in Carter v. Playmobil, Laura Carter brought a class action complaint, however, unlike the other 
consolidated cases, the Southern District of Florida ruled on Carter's motion for class certification and denied the motion without 
prejudice on August 5, 1996. In so doing, the Court found that plaintiff satisfied the prerequisites of Rule 23(a): (1) that the class 
is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) that there are questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) 
that the claims or defenses of the representative party are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) that the 
representative party will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. The Court, however, denied the motion to certify 
the class pursuant to Rule 23(b). The Court noted that Carter failed to address the extent to which litigation commenced by other 
members of the class preempts certification of this cause of action. In addition, the Court found that plaintiff failed to address the 
desirability, or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the Southern District of Florida. Consequently, the 
Court denied the motion without prejudice. "

Whitacre to stay at ADM by secretly supplementing his salary without having to report the additional income to the Internal 
Revenue Service. He nonetheless pled to the fraud, and U.S. District Court Judge Howard Baker of the Central District of Illinois 
sentenced him to a term of 108 months of incarceration. "
720,3," Whitacre suffers from bi-polar disorder which frequently causes him to experience bouts of depression. He has made two 
publicized unsuccessful suicide attempts; the second just days prior to his sentencing for his fraud conviction. To date, the court 
has seen no objective evidence to indicate that Whitacre's suicide attempts were genuine. "
727,4," This analysis does not account for the differing collateral consequences incidental to a crime of fraud or dishonesty as opposed 
to an antitrust offense; Whitacre's prior fraud conviction renders that question moot. See, e.g., Fed. R. Evid. 609 (a)(2) 
(conviction for a crime of dishonesty or making false statements is always admissible, regardless of punishment, notwithstanding "
728,," the standard ten-year time limit provided under Fed. R. Evid. 609(b)). This discussion is not intended nor should it be construed 
as the court's opinion or belief as to what sentence any of the defendants should or might receive for their price-fixing 
convictions."
728,5," Again, the analysis is not intended nor should it be construed as an invitation to further prosecute Mark Whitacre. "
729,6," At oral argument, government counsel claimed that Whitacre's allegations were motivated to thwart the lysine prosecution and 
then offered corroborative evidence never admitted at trial. The evidence was a tape of a purported conservation between 
Whitacre and his fraud confederate David Paige, which supposedly verifies the government's contention. At first, counsel 
insisted that the court could consider evidence outside the record, then immediately retracted his assertion. Government counsel 
is reminded that the scope of post-trial motions is limited to evidence entered into the record.  United States v. Baker, 78 F.3d 
1241, 1245 (7th Cir. 1996) (limiting sufficiency of evidence claims to evidence actually presented at trial). If the audiotape is as 
persuasive as counsel now contends, it should have been presented at the pretrial evidentiary hearing, or at the latest, during 
trial when Wilson invoked 804(b)(3) to admit Varounis' testimony. It undoubtedly would have assisted the court in ruling much 
faster on the thorny issues related to the motions to suppress for selective taping and Whitacre's allegations in general. Thus, 
the government has waived admission of the audiotape to support its argument. "
734,7," At oral argument, Wilson's counsel implied that Professor Areeda was some obscure antitrust scholar who did not carry any 
persuasive weight. However, Professor Areeda's scholarship has been cited by the U.S. Supreme Court in approximately 40 
opinions since 1968. In other words, Areeda is to antitrust what Professor Wayne R. LaFave is to criminal procedure, and his 
opinions should not be lightly dismissed. "
742,1," The plaintiffs originally sued only the Commission itself, but amended the complaint after defendants filed a motion to dismiss 
on Eleventh Amendment grounds. "
744,2," It bears noting that the district court in Patch permitted several utility companies not in the suit originally to intervene because 
the changes in the state's utility plan at issue in the case would directly affect their business.  Public Serv. Co. of New Hampshire 
v. Patch, 173 F.R.D. 17, 27 (D.N.H. 1997), aff'd, 136 F.3d 197 (1st Cir. 1998). The First Circuit did not address these rulings in 
affirming the district court's denial of intervention to the consumer groups and other parties."
744,3," The Wholesalers' argument that, if this court rules for the plaintiffs, it would have to strike all of § 15, rather than just the three 
license limit, is both incorrect and irrelevant to this discussion. As Judge Wolf recently observed, HN5[
] state law governs the 
severability of a state statute, and under Massachusetts law, if a court finds a part of a statute to be unconstitutional, the court 
should find the remainder of the statute constitutional and valid as far as possible if the remaining parts are severable.  
Canterbury Liquors & Pantry v. Sullivan, 999 F. Supp. 144, 147 (D. Mass. 1998). Here, the remainder of § 15 is clearly 
severable. Furthermore, even if all of § 15 were to be struck, the Wholesalers would still not have a sufficient interest because 
no part of the section is directly relevant to the Wholesalers' businesses."
744,4," The Wholesalers' reply memorandum simply elaborates on their asserted economic interests in the case, premised on the fact 
that eliminating the three license limit on retailers would have industry-wide effects. Their claim that such a change could 
endanger family-owned businesses which have benefitted the community in civic and charitable ways (Id. at 5) is simply 
another--and quite conjectural--way of stating a potential economic harm. "
745,5," Even if the Wholesalers did have a sufficient interest to justify intervention as of right, I would deny them intervention as of right 
because their interests are also adequately represented by the Commonwealth. The same reasoning I use in discussing this 
issue in relation to MassPack applies equally to the Wholesalers. "
746,6," The district court made this statement in the course of its decision to allow several utility companies to intervene. Because the 
grant of intervention rights to those parties was not appealed, the First Circuit did not address this issue."
746,7," To be sure, there are apparent in the submissions of the defendants and those of the proposed intervenors differences of 
emphasis presumably as a result of somewhat different views regarding the issues to be pressed at the motion to dismiss stage. 
The defendants--unlike the Wholesalers who offer a full argument--treat the 21st Amendment question only in a footnote and do 
not treat at length, as the Wholesalers do, the question of whether ownership limitations constitute a per se antitrust violation; 
nor do the defendants argue separately and extensively, as both the wholesalers and MassPack do, the question of Parker v. 
Brown immunity. As my disposition of the motion to dismiss suggests, the choice by the defendants of issues to present at the 
motion to dismiss stage appears sound. The additional arguments the proposed intervenors pressed at this stage appear more 
appropriate for consideration after some factfinding, if that were necessary. "
747,8," The Wholesalers also point out that when another liquor regulation was recently struck down in Canterbury Liquors & Pantry v. 
Sullivan, 16 F. Supp. 2d 41 (D. Mass. 1998), the Attorney General declined to appeal the decision. The case went on to the First 
Circuit only because the Wholesalers, who had intervened as defendants, appealed. The First Circuit, however, decided that the 
Wholesalers lacked standing to bring an appeal.  Sea Shore Corp. v. Sullivan, 158 F.3d 51 (1st Cir. 1998). The court concluded 
that where a defendant ""intervenor does not receive a direct benefit from a reversal of the decision below, it is not 'likely, as 
opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.'"" Id. at 58 (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of 
Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351, 112 S. Ct. 2130 (1992). It is by no means clear that the Wholesalers could make 
any more substantial standing here if I were to rule for the plaintiffs. "
748,9," As noted, the wholesaler amici press this point more forcefully. "
750,10," Defendants vigorously contest this assertion, pointing to numerous statutory controls as to the number and nature of liquor 
retail stores. I need not address this dispute because the provision challenged here, irrespective of residual discretion as to 
collateral questions of location, size and output, is unilateral state action simpliciter. "
751,11," The plaintiffs look to Hertz Corp. v. City of New York, 1 F.3d 121 (2d Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1111, 127 L. Ed. 2d 
375, 114 S. Ct. 1054, 114 S. Ct. 1055 (1994) for support. In Hertz, a rental car company challenged a city statute which 
prohibited rental car companies from charging differential fees based on a customer's residence.  Id. at 124. The Second Circuit 
found New York City's law to be a hybrid restraint in violation of the Sherman Act ""because it removes one element of 
competition in car-rental pricing, but does not further regulate or review the prices set by rental companies."" I find the reference to Hertz unpersuasive. As a leading commentary on antitrust law observes, ""The ordinance in Hertz did not 
give any private actor the discretion to impose any kind of restraint at all; as a result, its analysis is fundamentally inconsistent 
with [governing Supreme Court precedent]."" 1 Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 217c, at 319 (rev. ed. 
1997). "
755,1," NRS 49.275 states, in pertinent part as follows: ""HN1[
] No reporter . . . may be required to disclose any published or unpublished information obtained or prepared by 
such person in such person's professional capacity in gathering, receiving or processing information for communication to 
the public, or the source of any information procured or obtained by such person, in any legal proceedings . . . ."" "
765,*," The Honorable Marvin Katz, District Judge, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation."
765,1," Before 1989, Beech-Nut was owned by Nestle Food Co. In November 1989, Ralston Purina purchased Beech-Nut from Nestle. 
Therefore, the four defendants are actually Heinz, Gerber, Nestle/Beech-Nut, and Ralston/Beech-Nut."
765,2," The District Court certified the action as a class for the period beginning January 1, 1989, and ending December 31, 1992. "
767,3," The phrase ""concerted action"" is often used as shorthand for any form of activity meeting the Section 1 "" 'contract . . . 
combination or conspiracy' requirement."" Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp., 561 F.2d 434, 445-46 (3d Cir. 1977) quoting L. Sullivan, 
Law of Anti-Trusts, p. 312 (1977)."
767,4," The District Court disposed of plaintiffs' case under the first prong of Fesser; it did not reach prongs (2), (3), and (4). Only 
Nestle questioned whether the defendants provided sufficient proof of fact of injury and damages under prong (4). Because the 
District Court did not address and the defendants did not argue that plaintiffs' evidence fell short with respect to prongs (2) and 
(3), we do not consider them. "
769,5," Plaintiffs assert that in the baby food industry a communication from a competitor is referred to as ""rumor,"" a term of art. This 
characterization is attributed to an exchange between plaintiffs' counsel and Jerri Jean Wilson, Gerber's Director of Field 
Communications, during her deposition, where she stated that ""rumor"" means chit-chat that occurs among employees of the 
defendants on ""the street."" "
770,6," According to plaintiffs, ""Stages"" marked the beginning of Beech-Nut's effort to displace Gerber as the premium price brand of 
baby food and end its competition with Heinz for the more price sensitive consumer."
770,7," At the time, Beech-Nut was owned by Nestle. "
773,8," At oral argument, the plaintiffs cited the following cases as authority for this assertion: Vernon v. Southern Calif. Edison Co., 
955 F.2d 1361 (9th Cir. 1992); In re Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings, 906 F.2d 432 (9th Cir. 1990); Rosefielde v. Falcon Jet 
Corp., 701 F. Supp. 1053 (D.N.J. 1988). However, we conclude that none of these cases support the plaintiffs. Vernon did not 
involve price-fixing; rather, it concerned whether the defendant denied the plaintiff access to certain power transmission lines. In 
Pretrial Proceedings, testimony indicated that upper level executives engaged in secret conversations regarding product pricing. 
Id. 906 F.2d at 450. Similarly, in Rosenfield, testimony showed that several upper level executives ""were aware of the price "
774,," information exchange and considered the data obtained by sales engineers to set the price of business jets."" Id. 701 F. Supp. at 
1064. "
776,9," Plaintiffs assert that Heinz's McCloskey strongly advocated that Heinz enter the Chicago market in 1988 and 1991 and its 
unwillingness to enter proves that the 1984 ""truce"" remained in place. Plaintiffs ignore, however, the effort of Heinz to enter the 
Chicago market in 1988, evidenced by its formal, written proposal to Dominick's, a large Chicago supermarket chain. Dominick's 
rejected the proposal. "
777,10," Dr. Madansky initially set out to determine the prices paid by the plaintiffs to the defendants for baby food products. His results 
were based on ""the monthly dollar-volume weighted average of the per ounce price paid by Gerber and Beech-Nut customers 
who qualified for pricing at the 40,000 lb. or over price bracket and by all Heinz customers for the baby foods comprising 
Gerber's First Foods, Second Foods, Third Foods, Juices, and Cereals categories . . . ."" The purpose at the time apparently was 
to provide a basis for damages. "
779,11," We observe that most of the documents introduced by the plaintiffs merely discuss ""rumors"" that the authors heard or 
""suspicions"" that they had. As such, the documents can be discounted as non-probative for they show a lack of knowledge about 
the competitors' pricing and are inconsistent with a price-fixing scheme. For example, in the March 2, 1990, Beech-Nut 
document to which the plaintiffs point, the author merely states that he ""anticipates"" a Gerber price increase in the first quarter of 
1987. In another Beech-Nut document the author has had heard ""very strong rumors"" of a Gerber price increase. App. at 3893a. "
780,12," Despite its earlier conclusion ""that there is no permissible inference of parallel pricing,"" the District Court devoted 
approximately 20 of its 34-page opinion to the discussion of the plus factors. The extensive discussion by the district court at 
least negates the plaintiffs' complaint that the district court ignored the evidence. "
786,13," HN21[
]  28 U.S.C. § 1920(2) provides that a federal court may tax costs ""for all or any part of the stenographic transcript 
necessarily obtained for use in the case."""
786,14," HN22[
] New Jersey Local Rule 54.1(g)(7) provides, in pertinent part: In taxing costs, the Clerk shall allow all or part of the fees and charges incurred in the taking and transcribing of depositions 
used at the trial under Rule 32 of the Civil Rules. Fees and charges for the taking and transcribing of any other deposition 
shall not be taxed as costs unless the Court otherwise orders. . . .[emphasis added.] "
791,1," Alternatively, Defendant's motion seeks a new trial or an order of remittitur. Because the Court finds judgment as a matter of 
law should be granted in Defendant's favor, the Court need not address Defendant's alternative requests. "
795,2," While Plaintiff's exhibit 305 indicates Defendant sold below its AVC to 56 customers, R. at 770-71, testimony at trial from both 
sides indicated the number was 66. Therefore, the Court will use the latter figure in its discussion. "
805,1," For detailed information regarding the facts and proceedings in this action, see the Memorandum And Order (Doc. # 103) 
entered July 25, 1995, sustaining plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment (reported at 902 F. Supp. 1394 (D. Kan. 1995), aff'd, 
134 F.3d 1010 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 65, 1998 WL 334040 (1998)); the Memorandum And Order (Doc. # 815) 
entered April 20, 1998, overruling defendant's motion for partial summary judgment (reported at 5 F. Supp. 2d 921 (D. Kan. 
1998)); and the Memorandum And Order (Doc. # 814) entered April 17, 1998, overruling defendant's motion to decertify classes."
805,2," The jury awarded each class 75% of the damages which plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Robert D. Tollison, calculated it had sustained. 
Plaintiffs therefore ask the Court to award each class 75% of the CPI adjustment which Dr. Tollison attributed to it. Plaintiffs seek an additional adjustment for Mary Beth Spencer Dyson, a member of the Hall class. At trial, the parties stipulated 
that Dyson suffered $ 32,000.00 in damage as a result of the Rule. Plaintiffs note that because that amount exceeds the damage 
estimate which Dr. Tollison calculated for Dyson ($ 18,304.00 without a CPI adjustment), the total proposed adjustment for the 
Hall class is slightly higher than 75% of Dr. Tollison's figure. The NCAA attacks plaintiffs' proposal to increase the verdicts by 75% of Dr. Tollison's proposed adjustment, arguing that the jury 
verdicts covered the classes but that Dr. Tollison applied his CPI adjustment to individual class members. For this reason, 
according to the NCAA, Dr. Tollison's adjustment cannot be applied across the board to the class verdicts."
805,3," Plaintiffs do not ask the Court to award prejudgment interest under 15 U.S.C. § 15(a), which authorizes simple interest, if just, 
under circumstances described later in this order."
805,4, No other witnesses testified at the hearing. 
806,5," In Heatransfer Corp. v. Volkswagenwerk A.G., 553 F.2d 964, 986 n.20 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1087, 55 L. Ed. 
2d 792, 98 S. Ct. 1282 (1978), plaintiff's damages included $ 326,000.00 in interest on a capital value computation. Defendants 
challenged the inclusion, arguing that as a matter of law, prejudgment interest was not allowable. Plaintiff responded that the 
figure did not represent interest but was simply a means of establishing capital value loss at the date of trial. The district court 
held that the portion of the damage award which had been labeled ""interest"" could not be considered improper prejudgment 
interest. It noted some reservations about the manner in which plaintiff had calculated capital value loss, but declined to grant a 
remittitur in view of the Fifth Circuit rule that a court may not remit damages below that which a jury might have awarded. On 
appeal, without explanation, the Fifth Circuit rejected defendant's argument that prejudgment interest is not allowable as a 
matter of law. In Multiflex, Inc. v. Samuel Moore & Co., 709 F.2d 980, (5th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1100, 80 L. Ed. 2d 126, 104 S. Ct. 
1594 (1984), plaintiff's expert adjusted the damage estimates to create a net present value for plaintiff's previous injury. 
Defendant argued that the expert's projections ""amounted to nothing more than prejudgment interest, which normally would not 
be recoverable in an antitrust action."" Id. at 996 (citing Volkswagenwerk and 15 U.S.C. § 15). Relying on Volkswagenwerk, the 
Fifth Circuit held that plaintiff was entitled to recover amounts that its lost profits would have earned in an open investment 
market. It therefore affirmed the net present value adjustment to the damage award, finding that the claim was based on an 
economic theory and not on a claim to statutory or common law prejudgement interest.  Id. at 997."
806,6," In addition to the fact that the proposed CPI adjustment would be trebled, the NCAA complains that it would cover a greater 
time period than that permitted under Section 15(a) for the award of prejudgment interest. Under Section 15(a), the Court can 
only award prejudgment interest from the date of service of plaintiff's antitrust pleading to the date of judgment, or for any shorter 
period. Here, the date of service is not clear. Plaintiffs filed suit, however, on November 5, 1993, and September 3, 1994 (Law 
and Hall) and January 13, 1995 (Schreiber), and the Court entered judgment on May 4, 1998 in all three cases. Accordingly, 
statutory prejudgment interest could not cover a period longer than 40 to 53 months. Under plaintiffs' theory, the proposed CPI adjustment apparently runs from ""the year of damage"" for each particular coach, and 
runs to January 1997, so that damages for each coach are stated in 1997 dollars. Tr. 1456-58. For a coach who was employed 
when the Rule went into effect on August 1, 1992, the CPI adjustment could span as much as 68 months. For other coaches the 
time could be a much shorter one. The NCAA does not suggest whether the net outlay under the CPI adjustment would be 
greater or less than an adjustment that might be allowed for prejudgment interest."
806,7," In Locklin, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a trial court's refusal to increase antitrust damages to account for 
""inflationary shrinkage."" It found no authority for an adjustment to offset a decrease in the value of the dollar, and--with the single 
observation that plaintiffs' damages were trebled--rejected the argument that plaintiffs would not receive full compensation 
without an adjustment for interest.  429 F.2d at 876. In Hughes, the Second Circuit agreed. It interpreted congressional silence "
807,," as a sign that trebled damages would adequately serve the remedial interests of the antitrust laws and noted that ""trebled 
damages will more than adequately compensate [plaintiff] for its injuries."" 449 F.2d at 80. See also, Colorado v. Goodell Bros., 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14549, Civ. A. No. 84- A-803, 1987 WL 6771, at *4 (D. Colo. Feb. 
17, 1987) (inflation adjustment not allowed in antitrust action where treble damages awarded, citing Locklin); Smith v. Pro-
Football, Inc., 528 F. Supp. 1266, 1275 (D. D.C. 1981) (because of treble damages, prejudgment interest not needed to 
compensate plaintiff for injuries); and 4 Julian O. von Kalinowski, Antitrust Counseling and Litigation Techniques § 42.02[5], pp. 
42-8 (Matthew Bender 1993) (""it appears that no adjustment can be made for inflation,"" citing Locklin)."
807,8," No one asked Dr. Tollison to define what interest does represent, but the textbook definition of interest is ""the return paid to 
those who loan money."" Economics (13th ed.) by Samuelson & Nordhaus (McGraw-Hill 1989). "
808,9," The NCAA apparently argues that the statutory interest authorized in Section 15(a) includes an inflation component, but that 
fact has not been established as a matter of fact or law. "
809,10," In Bigelow, the Supreme Court explained that ""any other rule would enable the wrongdoer to profit by his wrongdoing at the 
expense of his victim"" and that ""failure to apply it would mean that the more grievous the wrong done, the less likelihood there 
would be of a recovery."" 327 U.S. at 264-65. "
811,11," The Court notes that the NCAA has just concluded another annual convention and that, so far as the record suggests, no 
movement was afoot to re-enact the Rule or its equivalent. "
816,1," Although the Third Circuit disagreed with the Ninth and D.C. Circuits, its decision is not inconsistent with our present decision 
because it limits re-examination of prior decisions to ""extraordinary circumstances [that] warrant such reconsideration."" Public 
Interest Research Group v. Magnesium Elektron, Inc., 123 F.3d 111, 118 (3d Cir. 1997). The ""extraordinary circumstances"" 
approved of by the Magnesium Elektron Court are the same exceptions to the law of the case doctrine recognized by this court 
in Becerra. See id. at 116-18."
816,2," Appellant's argument is even more incongruous with Art. 2315, considering that the Civil Code provision is expressly addressed 
to negligent conduct. Antitrust price-fixing is hardly negligent. "
817,3," Since 1990, this court has certified only nine cases to the Louisiana Supreme Court. See Hodgen v. Forest Oil Corp., 87 F.3d 
1512 (1996); Wallace v. Shreve Mem. Library, 79 F.3d 427 (1996); Naquin v. Prudential Assurance Co., Ltd., 65 F.3d 427 
(1995); First Nat'l Bank of Boston v. Beckwith Mach. Co., 26 F.3d 580 (1994); Schirmer v. Edwards, 2 F.3d 117 (1993); Grubbs 
v. Gulf Int'l Marine Inc., 985 F.2d 762 (1993); Frey v. Amoco Prod. Co., 951 F.2d 67 (1992); Louisiana v. Roemer, 949 F.2d 145 
(1991). In the most recent instance, we certified the pressing question ""whether dairy cows owned by a dairy farmer are exempt 
as tools or instruments of the debtor's trade under Louisiana Revised Statute 13:3881(A)(2)."" Wilson v. Bryan, 162 F.3d 378, 
1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 30840, 1998 WL 846838, at 2 (5th Cir. 1998)."
817,4," Section 51:137 reads: Any person who is injured in his business or property by any person by reason of any act or thing forbidden by this Part 
may sue in any court of competent jurisdiction and shall recover threefold the damages sustained by him, the cost of suit, 
and a reasonable attorney's fee."
817,5," 15 U.S.C. § 15 (1997). Section 4 of the Clayton Act reads in part: Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue 
therefor in any district court of the United States . . . and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the 
cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. "
818,6," Several state courts have interpreted their own antitrust laws, which also mirror § 4 of the Clayton Act, to deny standing to 
indirect purchasers. See Blewett v. Abbott Labs., Inc., 86 Wash. App. 782, 938 P.2d 842, 845-46 (Wash. Ct. App. 1997); Stifflear 
v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 931 P.2d 471, 475-76 (Colo. Ct. App. 1996); Mack v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 673 So. 2d 100, 
108, (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1996). But see Hyde v. Abbott Labs., Inc., 123 N.C. App. 572, 473 S.E.2d 680, 686 (N.C. Ct. App. 1996) 
(refusing to adopt the Illinois Brick rule, even though the state's antitrust statute is patterned after § 4 of the Clayton Act); Blake 
v. Abbott Labs., Inc., 1996 Tenn. App. LEXIS 184, 1996 WL 134947 (Tenn. Ct. App. March 27, 1996) (granting standing to 
indirect purchasers under the Tennessee Trade Practices Act)."
818,7," Under the ""last antecedent"" canon of statutory construction, a qualifying phrase in a statute ""usually is construed to apply to the 
provision or clause immediately preceding it."" In re RLV, 484 So. 2d 206, 209 (La. Ct. App. 1986)(quoting Sutherland Stat. 
Const. § 47.33 (4th ed. 1984)). "
819,8," The appellees also rely on Al Copeland Enters. v. Jamplis, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4258, 1991 WL 49651 *5 (E.D. La. 1991), to 
argue that ""Louisiana antitrust laws do not apply to interstate commerce . . . ."" Although the federal district court made this legal 
finding, it does not guide us in resolving how the Louisiana Supreme Court would decide the issue."
819,9," Our conclusion that the Louisiana Supreme Court should resolve this issue is reinforced by the subsequent events surrounding 
the Prescription Drugs case. One year after the Seventh Circuit's decision, the Alabama Supreme Court rejected Prescription 
Drugs and held that its antitrust laws are limited to intrastate conduct. See Abbott Labs. v. Durrett, 1998 Ala. LEXIS 208, 1998 
WL 436062, at *22 (Ala. July 31, 1998)."
819,10," Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XII, section 1 reads: When it appears to the Supreme Court of the United States, or to any circuit court of appeal of the United States, that there 
are involved in any proceedings before it questions or propositions of law of this state which are determinative of said cause 
independently of any other questions involved in said case and that there are no clear controlling precedents in the 
decisions of the supreme court of this state, such federal court before rendering a decision may certify such questions or 
propositions of law of this state to the Supreme Court of Louisiana for rendition of a judgment or opinion concerning such 
questions or propositions of Louisiana law. This court may, in its discretion, decline to answer the questions certified to it. "
826,1," The plaintiff class is defined as follows: All persons and entities in the United States who, at any time during the period from October 15, 1989, to the present, 
purchase or purchased prescription brand name drugs directly from any of the defendants. The class excludes defendants; 
other manufacturers of prescription brand name drugs; other wholesalers of prescription brand name drugs; co-conspirators 
of any of the foregoing entities; affiliates, parents and subsidiaries of any of the foregoing entities; governmental entities; 
mail order pharmacies; health maintenance organizations; hospitals; clinics; and nursing homes. "
828,2," Ms. Whitcomb's testimony about pharmacist's drug switching practices was undermined by the testimony of the Class Plaintiffs'

] Additional Obligations of Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers ""In addition to the duties contained in subsection (b) of this section, each incumbent local exchange carrier has the following 
duties: ""(1) Duty to Negotiate ""The duty to negotiate in good faith in accordance with section 252 of this title the particular terms and conditions of agreements 
to fulfill the duties described in paragraphs (1) through (5) of subsection (b) of this section and this subsection. The requesting 
telecommunications carrier also has the duty to negotiate in good faith the terms and conditions of such agreements. ""(2) Interconnection ""The duty to provide, for the facilities and equipment of any requesting telecommunications carrier, interconnection with the local 
exchange carrier's network -- ""(A) for the transmission and routing of telephone exchange service and exchange access; ""(B) at any technically feasible point within the carrier's network; ""(C) that is at least equal in quality to that provided by the local exchange carrier to itself or to any subsidiary, affiliate, or any 
other party to which the carrier provides interconnection; and ""(D) on rates, terms, and conditions that are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory, in accordance with the terms and 
conditions of the agreement and the requirements of this section and section 252 of this title. ""(3) Unbundled Access "
868,," ""The duty to provide, to any requesting telecommunications carrier for the provision of a telecommunications service, 
nondiscriminatory access to network elements on an unbundled basis at any technically feasible point on rates, terms, and 
conditions that are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement and 
the requirements of this section and section 252 of this title. An incumbent local exchange carrier shall provide such unbundled 
network elements in a manner that allows requesting carriers to combine such elements in order to provide such 
telecommunications service. ""(4) Resale ""The duty -- ""(A) to offer for resale at wholesale rates any telecommunications service that the carrier provides at retail to subscribers who 
are not telecommunications carriers; and ""(B) not to prohibit, and not to impose unreasonable or discriminatory conditions or limitations on, the resale of such 
telecommunications service, except that a State commission may, consistent with regulations prescribed by the Commission 
under this section, prohibit a reseller that obtains at wholesale rates a telecommunications service that is available at retail only 
to a category of subscribers from offering such service to a different category of subscribers. ""(5) Notice of Changes ""The duty to provide reasonable public notice of changes in the information necessary for the transmission and routing of 
services using that local exchange carrier's facilities or networks, as well as of any other changes that would affect the 
interoperability of those facilities and networks. ""(6) Collocation ""The duty to provide, on rates, terms, and conditions that are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory, for physical collocation of 
equipment necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network elements at the premises of the local exchange 
carrier, except that the carrier may provide for virtual collocation if the local exchange carrier demonstrates to the State 
commission that physical collocation is not practical for technical reasons or because of space limitations."""
868,2," Section 251(b) imposes the following duties on incumbents: HN2[
] ""(1) Resale ""The duty not to prohibit, and not to impose unreasonable or discriminatory conditions or limitations on, the resale of its 
telecommunications services. ""(2) Number Portability ""The duty to provide, to the extent technically feasible, number portability in accordance with requirements prescribed by the 
Commission. ""(3) Dialing Parity ""The duty to provide dialing parity to competing providers of telephone exchange service and telephone toll service, and the duty 
to permit all such providers to have nondiscriminatory access to telephone numbers, operator services, directory assistance, and 
directory listing, with no unreasonable dialing delays. ""(4) Access to Rights-of-Way ""The duty to afford access to the poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way of such carrier to competing providers of 
telecommunications services on rates, terms, and conditions that are consistent with section 224 of this title. ""(5) Reciprocal Compensation ""The duty to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the transport and termination of telecommunications."" "
869,3," TELRIC pricing is based upon the cost of operating a hypothetical network built with the most efficient technology available. 
Incumbents argued below that this method was unreasonable because it stranded their historic costs and underestimated the 
actual costs of providing interconnection and unbundled access. The Eighth Circuit did not reach this issue, and the merits of 
TELRIC are not before us."
869,4," Dialing parity, which seeks to ensure that a new entrant's customers can make calls without having to dial an access code, was 
addressed in the Commission's Second Report and Order. See In re Implementation of the Local Competition Provisions of the 
Telecommunications Act of 1996, 11 FCC Rcd 19392 (1996). In a separate opinion that is also before us today, the Eighth 
Circuit vacated this rule insofar as it went beyond the FCC's jurisdiction over interstate calls.  People of California v. FCC, 124 
F.3d 934, 943 (1997). "
870,5," JUSTICE BREYER says, post, at 10, that ""Congress enacted [the] language [of § 201(b)] in 1938,"" and that whether it confers 
""general authority to make rules implementing the more specific terms of a later enacted statute depends upon what that later 
enacted statute contemplates."" That is assuredly true. But we think that what the later statute contemplates is best determined, 
not by speculating about what the 1996 Act (and presumably every other amendment to the Communications Act since 1938) 
""foresees,"" ibid., but by the clear fact that the 1996 Act was adopted, not as a freestanding enactment, but as an amendment to, 
and hence part of, an Act which said that ""the Commission may prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary in the 
public interest to carry out the provisions of this Act."" JUSTICE BREYER cannot plausibly assert that the 1996 Congress was 
unaware of the general grant of rulemaking authority contained within the Communications Act, since § 251(i) specifically 
provides that ""nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or otherwise affect the Commission's authority under section 
201."" "
871,6," JUSTICE BREYER appeals to our cases which say that there is a ""'presumption against the pre-emption of state police power 
regulations,'"" post, at 10, quoting from Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 518, 120 L. Ed. 2d 407, 112 S. Ct. 2608 
(1992), and that there must be ""'clear and manifest' showing of congressional intent to supplant traditional state police powers,"" 
post, at 10, quoting from Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230, 91 L. Ed. 1447, 67 S. Ct. 1146 (1947). But the 
question in these cases is not whether the Federal Government has taken the regulation of local telecommunications 
competition away from the States. With regard to the matters addressed by the 1996 Act, it unquestionably has. The question is 
whether the state commissions' participation in the administration of the new federal regime is to be guided by federal-agency 
regulations. If there is any ""presumption"" applicable to this question, it should arise from the fact that a federal program 
administered by 50 independent state agencies is surpassing strange. The appeals by both JUSTICE THOMAS and JUSTICE BREYER to what might loosely be called ""States' rights"" are most 
peculiar, since there is no doubt, even under their view, that if the federal courts believe a state commission is not regulating in 
accordance with federal policy they may bring it to heel. This is, at bottom, a debate not about whether the States will be allowed 
to do their own thing, but about whether it will be the FCC or the federal courts that draw the lines to which they must hew. To be 
sure, the FCC's lines can be even more restrictive than those drawn by the courts -- but it is hard to spark a passionate ""States' 
rights"" debate over that detail. "
872,7," We discuss the Louisiana case because of the light it sheds upon the meaning of § 152(b). We of course do not agree with 
JUSTICE BREYER's contention, post, at 11, that the case ""raised a question almost identical to the one before us."" That case 
involved the Commission's attempt to regulate services over which it had not explicitly been given rulemaking authority; this one 
involves its attempt to regulate services over which it has explicitly been given rulemaking authority."
872,8," LEdHN[8B][
] [8B] Because this reasoning clearly gives separate meanings to the provisions ""apply"" and ""give the Commission jurisdiction,"" we do 
not understand why JUSTICE THOMAS asserts, post, at 9-10, that we have not given effect to every word that Congress used. 
Nor do we agree with JUSTICE THOMAS that our interpretation renders § 152(b) a nullity. See post, at 9. After the 1996 Act, § 
152(b) may have less practical effect. But that is because Congress, by extending the Communications Act into local 
competition, has removed a significant area from the States' exclusive control. Insofar as Congress has remained silent, 
however, § 152(b) continues to function. The Commission could not, for example, regulate any aspect of intrastate 
communication not governed by the 1996 Act on the theory that it had an ancillary effect on matters within the Commission's 
primary jurisdiction. JUSTICE THOMAS admits, as he must, that the Commission has authority to implement at least some portions of the 1996 Act. 
See post, at 7. But his interpretation of § 152(b) confers such inflexibility upon that provision that he must strain to explain where 
the Commission gets this authority. A number of the provisions he relies on plainly read, not like conferrals of authority, but like 
references to the exercise of authority conferred elsewhere (we think, of course, in § 201(b)). See, e.g.,  § 251(b)(2) (assigning 
state commissions ""the duty to provide, to the extent technically feasible, number portability in accordance with requirements 
prescribed by the Commission""); § 251(d)(2) (setting forth factors for the Commission to consider ""in determining what network 
elements should be made available for purposes of subsection (c)(3)""); § 251(g) (requiring that any pre-existing ""regulation, 
order, or policy of the Commission"" governing exchange access and interconnection agreements remain in effect until it is 
""explicitly superseded by regulations prescribed by the Commission""). Moreover, his interpretation produces a most chopped-up 
statute, conferring Commission jurisdiction over such curious and isolated matters as ""number portability, . . . those network 
elements that the carrier must make available on an unbundled basis for purposes of § 251(c), . . . numbering administration, . . . 
exchange access and interconnection requirements in effect prior to the Act's effective date, . . . and treatment of comparable 
carriers as incumbents . . . ,"" post, at 7, but denying Commission jurisdiction over much more significant matters. We think it 
most unlikely that Congress created such a strange hodgepodge. And, of course, JUSTICE THOMAS's recognition of any FCC 
jurisdiction over intrastate matters subjects his analysis to the same criticism he levels against us, post, at 10: Just as it is true 
that Congress did not explicitly amend § 152(b) to exempt the entire 1996 Act, neither did it explicitly amend § 152(b) to exempt 
the five provisions he relies upon. "
873,9," JUSTICE THOMAS says that the grants of authority to the Commission in § 251 would have been unnecessary ""if Congress 
believed . . . that § 201(b) provided the FCC with plenary authority to promulgate regulations."" Post, at 9. We have already 
explained that three of the five provisions on which JUSTICE THOMAS relies are not grants of authority at all. See n. 8, supra. 
And the remaining two do not support his argument because they are not redundant of § 201(b). HN11[
] Section 251(e), which provides that ""the Commission shall create or designate one or more impartial entities to administer telecommunications 
numbering,"" requires the Commission to exercise its rulemaking authority, as opposed to § 201(b), which merely authorizes the 
Commission to promulgate rules if it so chooses. Section 251(h)(2) says that the FCC ""may, by rule, provide for the treatment of 
a local exchange carrier . . . as an incumbent local exchange carrier for purposes of [§ 251]"" if the carrier satisfies certain 
requirements. This provision gives the Commission authority beyond that conferred by § 201(b); without it, the FCC certainly 
could not have saddled a nonincumbent carrier with the burdens of incumbent status. "
874,10," JUSTICE THOMAS notes that it is well settled that state officers may interpret and apply federal law, see, e.g., United States 
v. Jones, 109 U.S. 513, 27 L. Ed. 1015, 3 S. Ct. 346 (1883), which leads him to conclude that there is no constitutional 
impediment to the interpretation that would give the States general authority, uncontrolled by the FCC's general rulemaking 
authority, over the matters specified in the particular sections we have just discussed. Post, at 12-13. But constitutional 
impediments aside, we are aware of no similar instances in which federal policymaking has been turned over to state 
administrative agencies. The arguments we have been addressing in the last three paragraphs of our text assume a scheme in 
which Congress has broadly extended its law into the field of intrastate telecommunications, but in a few specified areas 
(ratemaking, interconnection agreements, etc.) has left the policy implications of that extension to be determined by state 
commissions, which -- within the broad range of lawful policymaking left open to administrative agencies -- are beyond federal 
control. Such a scheme is decidedly novel, and the attendant legal questions, such as whether federal courts must defer to state 
agency interpretations of federal law, are novel as well. "
876,11," JUSTICE SOUTER points out that one can say his ability to replace a light bulb is ""impaired"" by the absence of a ladder, and 
that a ladder is ""necessary"" to replace the bulb, even though one ""could stand instead on a chair, a milk can, or eight volumes of 
Gibbon."" True enough (and nicely put), but the proper analogy here, it seems to us, is not the absence of a ladder, but the 
presence of a ladder tall enough to enable one to do the job, but not without stretching one's arm to its full extension. A ladder 
one-half inch taller is not, ""within an ordinary and fair meaning of the word,"" post, at 4, ""necessary,"" nor does its absence ""impair"" 
one's ability to do the job. We similarly disagree with JUSTICE SOUTER that a business can be impaired in its ability to provide 
services -- even impaired in that ability ""in an ordinary, weak sense of impairment,"" post, at 5 -- when the business receives a 
handsome profit but is denied an even handsomer one. "
881,1," I agree with the majority's analysis of the unbundling and pick-and-choose rules, which were not challenged on jurisdictional

883,3," I agree with the majority, ante, at 18, that respondents' challenge to the FCC's assertion that it has authority under 47 U.S.C. § 
208 to consider complaints arising under the 1996 Act is not ripe for review. It appears to me, however, that the Court of Appeals 
conclusion that the FCC lacks such authority carries considerable force. "
885,4," My conclusion applies with equal force to other FCC regulations that trump the state commissions' responsibilities, including 
exemptions, suspensions, and modification, § 251(f); approval of agreements predating the Act, § 252(a); and pre-emption of 
state access regulations that are inconsistent with FCC dictates, § 251(d)(3). "

912,9," In PepsiCo, this Circuit held that an amended complaint of the plaintiff, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, merely recited a 
""bare-bones assertion"" that there had been a horizontal conspiracy by a soft drink syrup manufacturer and bottlers in violation of 
Section One of the Sherman Act. See PepsiCo, 836 F.2d at 181. Because the amended complaint ""did not come close to 
adequately pleading conduct amounting to any of these per se offenses [under the Sherman Act],"" the court affirmed the 
dismissal of the district court for failure to state a claim. See id. at 183, 184. In so holding, the court looked only to the averments 
in the pleadings; ""the legal theories set forth in … [the] brief are helpful only to the extent that they find support in the allegations 
set forth in the complaint."" Id. at 181; see also id. (quoting Car Carriers, Inc., 745 F.2d at 1107)(""'It is axiomatic that the 
complaint may not be amended by the briefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss.'""). Although the court in PepsiCo construed the 
pleadings in the context of the Soft Drink Interbrand Competition Act of 1980, 15 U.S.C. §§ 3501-3503, the rationale extends to 
the instant action. "
913,10," The relevant geographic market is the appropriate ""section of the country"" within which the impact of an alleged 
anticompetitive activity is measured.  Brown Shoe Co., 370 U.S. at 336. In determining the suitability of a definition of the 
relevant geographic market, ""commercial realities"" such as the location of customers and the available sources of supply must 
be considered. See id. An antitrust plaintiff must define the relevant geographic area by ""careful selection of the market area in 
which the seller operates, and to which the purchaser can practically turn for supplies."" Tampa Elec. Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 
365 U.S. 320, 327, 5 L. Ed. 2d 580, 81 S. Ct. 623 (1961). The relevant geographic market may be local, regional, national or

Sequential sufficiently alleged a relevant geographic market."

916,12," California Motor Transport Co. involved an action by one group of trucking companies (the plaintiffs) against another (the 
defendants) for treble damages and injunctive relief under the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants 
conspired to institute state and federal proceedings to defeat applications by the plaintiffs to acquire or transfer operating rights. 
The Supreme Court stated, inter alia, the defendants had the right to join together to petition the judicial branch of government. 
The Court held: The right to petition extends to all departments of the Government. The right of access to the courts is indeed but one 
aspect of the right of petition. We conclude that it would be destructive of rights of association and of petition to hold that 
groups with common interests may not, without violating the antitrust laws, use the channels and procedures of … courts to 
advocate their causes and points of view respecting resolution of their business and economic interests vis-a-vis their 
competitors."

919,14," Had Sequential pleaded the sorting product of Syncsort is unique and not interchangeable, however, the contractual restraints 
in the Licensing Agreement and Non-Disclosure Agreement may be considered the equivalent of monopoly power. See Queen 
City Pizza, 124 F.3d at 439 (citing and distinguishing Eastman Kodak Co., 504 U.S. 451, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265, 112 S. Ct. 2072); "

920,15," Sequential, however, signed neither the Licensing Agreement nor the Non-Disclosure Agreement. It appears Sequential may 
lack standing to pursue a contractual remedy against Syncsort. "
921,16," In Matsushita, American producers alleged their Japanese competitors (the defendants) maintained a monopoly over the 
Japanese domestic television market and were using the profits derived in Japan to fund a predatory pricing scheme in America. 
The Supreme Court refused to find an antitrust violation. The Court stated: Nor does the possibility that [the defendants] have obtained supracompetitive profits in the Japanese market change this 
calculation. Whether or not [the defendants] have the means to sustain substantial losses in this country over a long period 
of time, they have no motive to sustain such losses absent some strong likelihood that the alleged conspiracy in this 
country will eventually pay off."
921,475," U.S. at 593. Because the defendants were ""unlikely to recoup their foregone profits,"" their conduct did not amount to an 
antitrust violation. See Advo, 51 F.3d at 1203 (citing and interpreting Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 593)."

923,18," The relevant portions of the Syncsort Advertisements are set forth in the False Advertising Counterclaim. The Syncsort

unmatched sort performance on UNIX systems. It's been proven time and time again in benchmark tests …. [SyncSort made] a 
new world record.'"" False Advertising Counterclaim at P 86 (quoting Syncsort Website Advertisement). The Syncsort Magazine Advertisement states: ""'Now the world's fastest sort technology has the friendly face of Windows NT.'"" 
Id. at P 88 (quoting Syncsort Magazine Advertisement). The Syncsort Mailing Advertisement states that SyncSort combines the ""'world's fastest sort technology' with a new Windows 
program. 'Benchmark tests … rigorously test SyncSort's design to ensure that it is the fastest and most efficient sort product on 
every platform.'"" Id. at P 90 (quoting Syncsort Mailing Advertisement). "
924,19," Castrol involved an advertisement by the defendant, Pennzoil, which stated, among other things, viscosity breakdown leads to 
engine failure, and Pennzoil outperforms any leading motor oil against viscosity breakdown. See Castrol, 987 F.2d at 946-47. 
Pennzoil sought to substantiate its claims of superiority by reference to comparative testing.  Id. at 946. In affirming the findings 
of the district court that the advertising claims of Pennzoil were literally false, the Third Circuit stated: Pennzoil's failure to specifically mention its competitors in the sentence promoting engine protection … does not render the 
statement puffery. First, the district court found that the statement compared Pennzoil to its major competitors by necessary 
implication. Pennzoil stated it is superior to the other brands in protecting against viscosity breakdown, noting that viscosity 
breakdown leads to engine problems. It left the consumer with the obvious conclusion that Pennzoil is superior to the other 
leading brands in protection against engine problems. Therefore, Pennzoil did, by implication, compare its effectiveness 
against engine wear to that of its competitors …. Id. at 946."
924,20," It is not disputed that Sequential properly pleaded the remaining elements of a false advertising claim under the Lanham Act. 
See Ditri, 954 F.2d at 872. Sequential has properly alleged the advertised goods traveled in interstate commerce. See Antitrust 
Counterclaim at P 73. Sequential also alleged the materiality of the deception in terms of the influence the Syncsort 
Advertisements have on purchasing decisions. See False Advertising Counterclaim at P 94. Lastly, Sequential sufficiently 
alleged a likelihood of injury as evidenced by ""lost sales."" See id. at P 93. "
929,*," Honorable Jane Restani, of the United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation. "
930,1," This appeal concerns only plaintiffs' antitrust claims, and they made none against NML. Thus Hodgkins is the sole respondent 
on appeal. "
931,2," For simplicity, we will refer to both Special and Soliciting Agents as Sales Agents. "
932,3," The facts relating to the Bogans' termination are highly contested but relate only to their state law claims, not the antitrust claim 
at issue on appeal. Plaintiffs need not show enforcement of the alleged agreement in restraint of trade to prove their antitrust 
claim. See American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 810, 90 L. Ed. 1575, 66 S. Ct. 1125 (1946). We therefore 
present these facts in abbreviated form simply to clarify the context of the litigation and as an example of the functioning of the 
Agreement."
932,4," HN2[
] The rule of reason directs the trier of fact to ""decide whether the questioned practice imposes an unreasonable 
restraint on competition, taking into account a variety of factors, including specific information about the relevant business, its 
condition before and after the restraint was imposed, and the restraint's history, nature, and effect."" State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 
U.S. 3, 10, 139 L. Ed. 2d 199, 118 S. Ct. 275 (1997). "
933,5," The Bogans are not estopped from alleging in this case that the Agreement was not NML policy, despite having characterized 
the restraint as such in state court. HN3[
] Generally, a party may not take a position inconsistent with that taken in a prior legal 
proceeding, where that party prevailed in the first case. See Davis v. Wakelee, 156 U.S. 680, 689, 39 L. Ed. 578, 15 S. Ct. 555 
(1895). Where, as here, the party did not succeed, that party is not estopped from later inconsistent assertions. See Merrill 
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Georgiadis, 903 F.2d 109, 114 (2d Cir. 1990). Thus, a party is not bound by a position not 
successfully maintained. See In re Cassidy, 892 F.2d 637, 641 (7th Cir. 1990). "
934,6," Plaintiffs conceded at oral argument that they cannot succeed under the rule of reason, so the issue on appeal is only whether 
the Agreement is per se illegal. To avoid examining the relevant market, market power, and anticompetitive effect in all cases in 
which conduct does not clearly fit within a per se category, the Supreme Court has sanctioned an intermediate inquiry, known as 
""quick look,"" if the conduct at issue is a ""naked restriction."" See NCAA v. Board of Regents, 468 U.S. 85, 109, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70, 
104 S. Ct. 2948 (1984). HN6[
] Under quick look, once the defendant has shown a procompetitive justification for the conduct, 
see id. at 113, ""the court must proceed to weigh the overall reasonableness of the restraint using a full-scale rule of reason 
analysis,"" United States v. Brown Univ., 5 F.3d 658, 669 (3d Cir. 1993). Here, Hodgkins has countered the Bogans' characterization of the Agreement as a ""naked restriction"" with sound allegations of 
procompetitive benefit. Thus, at best the inquiry returns to the rule of reason, under which the plaintiffs concede they lose. "
936,7," Furthermore, the Bogans' submarket definition is inconsistent with their claim to antitrust injury. Given that NML is only one of 
many carriers in the New York area, any alleged conspiracy by General Agents to restrict intra-NML transfers would only 
encourage other insurers' entry into a hypothetically distinct market for experienced NML agents, increasing competition. "
939,1," ""Generation"" is the conversion of energy from fuel or other sources into electricity. ""Transmission"" refers to the transportation of 
electricity via high voltage lines from generation facilities to distribution areas. ""Distribution"" involves the delivery and sale of 
electricity to ultimate retail and wholesale consumers. Compl., at P 7. "
943,2," Although defendants cite to Pacificorp, 1995 WL 445318, *2 n.1 (F.E.R.C., July 27, 1995), to support their contention that their 
request for suspension prevented the amendment from becoming effective, Pacificorp does not address the issue for which it is 
cited. See RJN, Ex. L. Despite this, it appears that federal law requires FERC approval for changes in ""electric service"" and the 
amendment did not become effective. See 18 C.F.R. § 35.2(a). "
964,1," The court strongly suggests that 3M settle on a geographic definition quickly. It will not be permitted to waffle on market 
definition at trial."
964,2," The parties apparently agree that analysis under § 1 of the Sherman Act should track the analysis under § 3 of the Clayton Act. 
Below, the court addresses whether a claim under § 2 of the Sherman Act is similarly subsumed by the Clayton Act analysis. "
966,3," Because of the high correlation between distribution and overall market share in the carbonless sheet market, the following 
observation in Ryko may not be applicable to this case: Where the exclusive dealing restraint operates at the distributor level, rather than at the consumer level, we require a higher 
standard of proof of ""substantial foreclosure,"" because it is less clear that a restraint involving a distributor will have a 
corresponding impact on the level of competition in the consumer market."
966,823, F.2d at 1235. 
970,4," 3M places great emphasis on the fact that, after months of discovery, Appleton has been unable to locate a single form from 
the relevant 1989 print run that actually made it outside the company. Yet this fact is important only if the court accepts the 
premise that, in order to constitute a public use, the invention must have physically fallen into the hands of someone who works 
outside 3M. As discussed above, the court rejects this novel and unduly narrow conceptualization of ""public use."" Indeed, the 
fact that during discovery Appleton and 3M were unable to locate a single specimen of the thousands of distributed sample 
forms, even within 3M files, demonstrates how unrestricted their 1989 dissemination really was. "
971,5," In fact, even if the court were to consider evidence of the subjective intentions of the inventors in this case, much of it would 
support the finding that the decision to disseminate forms throughout the company was for a purpose other than experimental 
validation. For example, even before the distribution of the sample form sets, Perrington told 3M management that he was 
""convinced … that we had all the necessary information"" about the invention's technical feasibility. Perrington Depo. at 703. "
975,1," Ballantine asserts that the Brennans improperly named Ballantine as a codefendant in the counterclaim because Ballantine is 
not a plaintiff in the original action. In the surreply, however, Ballantine states that ""in the final analysis, the procedural issues 
raised by the Brennans' tactics do not require this court's attention. No matter how the procedure plays out, there is no claim 
asserted against Ballantine upon which relief can be granted."" "
976,2, Count one of the Brennans' counterclaim alleges as follows:
976,149," . Steward at all times acted with the actual or apparent authority of Sugar Busters, L.L.C. and each of its partners in his 
dealings with Ellen Brennan."
976,150," . The following course or conduct, as described above in more detail, constitutes unfair trade practices by Sugar 
Busters, L.L.C., Steward, Bethea, Andrews, and Balart: (a) inducing Ellen Brennan in December 1996 and thereafter to continue with Sugar Busters, L.L.C. when her services were 
still needed for the Diet Book by allowing Steward to promise and agree to co-author a cookbook with her; (b) deciding one year later in December 1997 that Steward would not be allowed to do a cookbook with Ellen Brennan 
when her services were no longer needed for the Diet Book; (c) convincing Steward in December 1997 to breach his contractual obligation to publish a cookbook with Ellen Brennan 
because they ""changed their minds,"" even though Ballantine was willing to allow him to do so; (d) suggesting that Ellen Brennan publish a cookbook alone and ""snuggle up"" to the Diet Book ""just as close as you can 
get"" when that was not sincere or intended; (e) discharging Ellen Brennan within three days of learning she had retained counsel and had requested a meeting; (f) eliminating her entirely from any participation in the Second Edition when she was led to believe earlier that she would 
be part of any second edition of the Diet Book and when the success of the Diet Book was attributable in large measure to 
her efforts; "
977,," (g) explaining to her that the 60-day termination provision in their ""contract"" was for her benefit and failing to explain that it 
was included so that Sugar Busters, L.L.C. could eliminate her later if the Diet Book was successful; and (h) refusing to honor a settlement of its claims because Ballantine objected to it and the partners once again ""changed their 
minds."""
977,3," In count four, in relevant part, the Brennans allege that ""trademark affords a potentially perpetual monopoly over the way in 
which particular goods or services are identified and sold"" and that Sugar Busters' and its partners' attempt ""to prevent other 
third parties and the Brennans from using the phrase 'Sugar Busters' (or variants of the phrase) through all available means 
constitutes an attempt to monopolize the market for actual and potential goods and services based on established dietary 
principles and concepts in the New Orleans area."" In count five, the Brennans allege that"

977,191," . The agreement between Sugar Busters, L.L.C. and Ballantine includes using all available means to prohibit third 
parties from using the only reasonable way to identify goods or services related to the diet principles described in the Diet 
Book and is an abuse of the trademark laws and a restraint of trade. 192. The agreement between Sugar Busters, L.L.C. 
and Ballantine restrains trade in the market for actual and potential goods and services based on established dietary 
principles and concepts in the New Orleans area. . . . ."
977,194," . If Sugar Busters, L.L.C., its partners, and Ballantine were successful in their efforts, they would have effective control

977,4," In count six, the Brennans assert that the conduct described in counts four and five also violates the antitrust laws of the State 
of Louisiana, which prohibit the same conduct and afford the same relief as their federal counterparts. "
990,1," The letter from Mr. Rieck, on Potter, Inc. letterhead, and sent to Nowogroski Inc. clients, stated: I am pleased to announce that two associates and myself from Nowogroski/Stanley R. Olson Insurance have merged with 
Potter, Leonard and Cahan Insurance Brokers of Seattle. . . . . "
991,," To transfer your insurance account to our new firm, it is necessary to have you complete and sign the enclosed

] The existence of a contract protecting trade secrets does not preclude a separate cause of action in tort under the 
provisions defining trade secrets. The terms of a contract may be relevant to such issues as the existence of a protectable trade 
secret or the creation of a duty of confidence.  RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF UNFAIR COMPETITION § 40 cmt. a, at 454 
(1995); see also  Boeing Co. v. Sierracin Corp., 108 Wn.2d 38, 48, 738 P.2d 665 (1987). "
994,3," The RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF UNFAIR COMPETITION (1995), which analyzes extensive case law decided under the 
Uniform Trade Secrets Act, points to industry practice as a potentially valuable clue to expected and proper behavior in 
considering whether a ""relationship of confidence"" exists. The employment relationship is a confidential relationship which gives 
rise to a postemployment duty not to disclose trade secrets. Victoria A. Cundiff, The New ALI Restatement and Trade Secrets, in 
PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, AND LITERARY PROPERTY *697-98 (PLI Handbook Series No. GA-3948, Sept. 
1995), available in Westlaw 416/Pat 683. In the present case, the employees offered to purchase their customers' 
 [***21] accounts prior to leaving employment, and when a mutually agreeable price could not be reached they simply used the 
confidential customer list to attempt to take the customers. Additionally, based on the evidence in this record, it appears to be 
the accepted practice in the insurance industry to buy books of insurance for a percentage of the yearly commissions. 
Nowogroski Inc. had spent many hundreds of thousands of dollars over a period of years purchasing client accounts from other 
insurance companies. Also, the employment manual and employee agreements informed employees that the client information 
was a trade secret. Mr. Rieck testified that he knew that customer lists of the insurance agency were confidential information."
994,4," It is useful to understand the concept of ""misappropriation"" in a case involving customer lists which qualify as trade secrets. In 
considering the concept of misappropriation, a number of courts have distinguished between active solicitation of customers by 
former employees and a professional announcement of a change of employment. There is no question here that the former 
employees actively solicited their former employers' clients. The California Uniform Trade Secrets Act includes the same 
definition of ""misappropriation"" as the Washington Act. The California Court of Appeals recently explained that: The letter sent to former [employers'] customers over [the employee's] signature went beyond merely announcing his new 
affiliation and actively solicited business for his new company. . . . The question of whether a former employee's particular disclosure or use of customer information is permissible as falling 
within the right to use general knowledge and experience gained in former employment, or whether it constitutes a 
prohibited misuse of a former employer's  [***23] trade secrets, has been the frequent subject of litigation in California. 
While California courts have shown a reluctance to impose an unconditional prohibition on doing business with customers 
of the former employer, they have prohibited the unlawful use of trade secrets to solicit those customers. In cases decided 
both before and after the adoption of the UTSA, the decisions have equated acts of solicitation with ""use"" or 
""misappropriation"" of protected information. . . . Our Supreme Court provided this rough definition of solicitation: ""'Solicit' . . . 
means: 'To appeal to (for something); to apply to for obtaining something; to ask earnestly; to ask for the purpose of "
995,," receiving . . . .'"" By contrast, ""merely informing customers of one's former employer of a change in employment, without 
more, is not solicitation."" Morlife, Inc. v. Perry, 56 Cal. App. 4th 1514, 66 Cal. Rptr. 2d 731, 737-38 (1997) (citations omitted); see also  MAI Sys. Corp. v. 
Peak Computer, Inc., 991 F.2d 511, 521 (9th Cir. 1993). "
997,5," The Uniform Trade Secrets Act displaces conflicting tort, restitutionary and other law pertaining to civil liability for 
misappropriation of a trade secret, but does not affect contractual or other civil liability based on misappropriation of a trade 
secret or criminal liability for misappropriation of a trade secret. RCW 19.108.900.  [***32] This state's common law that trade 
secrets may include both tangible and intangible information does not conflict with any provision in the Uniform Trade Secrets 
Act."
997,6," The Georgia court's distinction between written and memorized customer lists was based on Georgia's common law prior to its 
adoption of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, which declined to protect secrets contained in an employee's memory. The court 
explained that it would not presume that the legislature, in adopting the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, was abrogating prior Georgia 
law on the subject.  Avnet, Inc. v. Wyle Lab., Inc. 263 Ga. 615, 437 S.E.2d 302, 305 (1993). Under this reasoning, the opposite 
result would be true in Washington because, as noted above, this state's common law did protect customer lists, whether written 
or remembered, prior the adoption of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act. "
1003,1," The Court notes that although NPR invokes Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) in support of its request for dismissal, the challenge to the 
Court's jurisdiction over plaintiff's claims, based upon the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, is more properly characterized as 
raising a defense of lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). See e.g., Liquilux Gas Corp. v. Martin Gas 
Sales, 771 F. Supp. 502 (D.P.R. 1991), aff'd., 979 F.2d 887 (1st Cir. 1992). However, because the standards are the same, the 
distinction is inconsequential. See Negron-Gaztambide v. Hernandez-Torres, 35 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 1994). "
1004,2," Although Counts 1, 2, 3, and 5 of Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint are dismissed, the Plaintiff is not left without a remedy. 
The Court is cognizant of Plaintiff's submission of a Complaint and Petition for Declaratory Order to the STB, via Informative 
Motion (Docket No. 49, Exhibit 1). Similarly after a case which was dismissed upon similar grounds (i.e., filed-rate doctrine 
preempted that court's jurisdiction) by the Superior Court of Puerto Rico, San Juan, a Plaintiff in an analogous position initiated 
an action before the FMC, which ruled in their favor. Mar-Mol Co. and CopyCorp v. Sea Land Servs., Inc., FMC Dkt. No. 95-11, 
27 S.R.R. 850 (Init. Dec., 1996)."
1004,3," NPR is a privately-owned steamship company whose predecessor was the former government-owned company, the Puerto 
Rico Maritime Shipping Authority."
1004,4," Under a Time Volume Agreement or ""TVA"", the shipper commits to ship with the carrier a minimum quantity of containers over 
a specified period of time. In return for this commitment, the carrier guarantees the shipper that the rate charged for each 
shipment will not change during that period of time. "
1005,5," NPR also invokes the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. As it will become evident in our discussion, this Court finds it is 
unnecessary to address the applicability of this doctrine to the instant case. "
1008,6," See also G.&T. Terminal Packaging Co. v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 830 F.2d 1230, 1234 (3d Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 
988, 108 S. Ct. 1291, 99 L. Ed. 2d 501 (1988)."
1008,7," Law 75 is designed to protect alleged distributor, regardless of the effect on competition or the market. See generally P.R. 
LAWS ANN. tit.10 § 278, et. seq (1964). "
1009,8," NPR raised an issue regarding whether OLMI established that it did in fact ship 76% of so-called exempt commodities. 
According to NPR, the very statutory and regulatory authorities relied on by OLMI provide that only some agricultural 
commodities are in the exempt status category; others are not and must be transported only pursuant to filed tariff rates. This is 
an issue that the Court need not decide. "
1010,9," Similarly in the field of Labor Relations under the Taft Hartley Act, Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (Taft-Hartley Act) 
(June 23, 1947, ch. 120, 61 Stat. 136; 29 U.S.C. § 151 et. sec., even when the N.L.R.B. refused as a matter of discretion to 
extend jurisdiction to a dispute, the states were not free to act in these areas. See San Diego Building Trades Council v. 
Garmon, 353 U.S. 26, 77 S. Ct. 607, 1 L. Ed. 2d 618 (1957); Guss v. Utah Labor Relations Bd., 353 U.S. 1, 77 S. Ct. 598, 1 L. "
1011,," Ed. 2d 601 (1957); Meat Cutters Local 427 v. Fairlawn Meats, Inc., 353 U.S. 20, 77 S. Ct. 604, 1 L. Ed. 2d 613 (1957). States 
remained preempted under the N.L.R.B. from acting in exempt areas. Congress in 1959 enacted Section 14(c) of the statute 
authorizing states to enter into these areas. No Termination Act statute has been called to the attention of this Court granting 
jurisdiction to the states over exempt products. "
1012,10," Under the Termination Act, as under its predecessor statutes, while the regulatory agency exercises jurisdiction to hear cases 
charging violation of the Act, the courts, both federal and state, act as the forums for collection or for refund of transportation 
charges in suits brought by carriers or shippers for refunds. See Reiter v. Cooper, 507 U.S. 258, 269, 113 S. Ct. 1213, 1221, 122 
L. Ed. 2d 604 (1993). When these cases involve a particular issue that is specifically within the competence of a federal agency, 
the court may, if it so chooses, refer such issue to the agency for determination. Such a referral is an instance of the application 
of the doctrine of primary agency jurisdiction, Reiter, supra, 507 U.S. at 268, and may entail the dismissal of all claims within the 
agency's primary jurisdiction. See, Total Telecommunications Services, Inc. v. American Telephone and Telegraph Co., 919 F. 
Supp. 472, 478 (D.D.C.), affirmed, 321 U.S. App. D.C. 309, 99 F.3d 448 (D.C. Cir. 1996)."
1012,11," Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., 204 U.S. at 446-47, 27 S. Ct. at 357-58 (quoting then § 22 ""… Nothing in this 
act contained shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute, but the provisions of this 
act are in addition to such remedies.""). The Supreme Court noted that: ""And by § 22, which we shall hereafter fully consider, 
existing appropriate common-law and statutory remedies were saved,"" Id. 27 S. Ct. at 354, but nevertheless held that permitting 
""standard[s] [which] would fluctuate and vary, dependent upon the divergent conclusions reached as to reasonableness by the 
various courts called upon to consider the subject…"" Id. 27 S. Ct. at 355, would be inconsistent with the basic statutory scheme: 
""Indeed the recognition of such a right is wholly inconsistent with the administrative power conferred upon the Commission, and 
with the duty, which the statute casts upon that body, of seeing to it that the statutory requirement as to uniformity and equality of 
rates is observed. Equally obvious is it that the existence of such a power in the court…would lead to favoritism, to the 
enforcement of one rate in one jurisdiction and a different one in another…"" Id. (Emphasis added). "
1013,12," Moreover, OLMI has not shown to this Court that any exemptions for price-setting from the antitrust laws have ever been given 
to water carriers in noncontiguous domestic offshore trade, by either the ICC or the FMC, and a Report to Congress submitted 
by the Department of Transportation in March, 1997 on ""Competition in the Noncontiguous Domestic Trades"", which is part of 
the record of this case, indicates that active price competition in the U.S.-Puerto Rican trades has driven the rates down in the 
last ten years. "
1020,*," Hon. Frank J. Magill, Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation."
1020,1," The Amended Complaint lists the defendants as ""Ethyl Corporation and John Does 1-10."" It describes the ""Doe"" defendants as 
""individuals and corporate entities including Ethyl's employees, agents, and unrelated corporate entities which conspired with 
Ethyl in the misconduct alleged in the complaint."" For ease in reference, we will refer throughout this opinion to all defendants as 
""Ethyl."" "
1021,2," The District Court's order of February 5, 1998 granted Ethyl's motion for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 56(c) ""for an Order of dismissal of the Complaint."" App. 3088. Because the grant of summary judgment and the 
dismissal of the complaint are inconsistent, we will disregard reference to the ""dismissal"" of Cheminor's complaint and treat the 
record as a summary judgment record. "
1022,3," The Countervailing Duty investigation inquires whether the foreign company received subsidies from its government. The 
AntiDumping investigation deals with the question of whether the foreign company actually brought the subsidized goods into the 
United States and sold them for less than fair value."
1022,4," The ITC and the DOC divide up the investigation. The ITC determines whether the domestic industry has suffered material 
injury; the DOC determines whether the foreign company has received foreign government subsidies and whether the foreign 
company has been dumping product at less than fair value."
1022,5," In a preliminary determination, the ITC must determine whether there is a reasonable indication of material injury or the threat 
thereof to the domestic industry ""by reason of"" the imports under investigation. In its final determination, the ITC must determine 
that there is a material injury or threat thereof to the domestic industry by reason of the imports under investigation."
1022,6," The best information available comprised Ethyl's petition and questionnaire and arguments from the parties' counsel -- 
Cheminor refused to submit verified information to the ITC."
1022,7," Ethyl's ibuprofen constituted the entire domestic market because it was the only domestic manufacturer of ibuprofen at the time 
the petition was filed."
1022,8," The Government of India subsidized the production of bulk ibuprofen for export by establishing: (1) below interest rate loans for 
exporters, (2) post-shipment financing loans to enable exporters to extend credit to foreign buyers, (3) tax deductions for foreign 
sales, (4) a rebate of indirect taxes on exported merchandise, and (5) duty-free importation of raw materials used in exported 
products (Advance licenses). App. 2172-82."
1022,9," The basic formula for determining a dumping margin is defined as ""the amount by which the normal value exceeds the export 
price or constructed export price of the subject merchandise."" 19 U.S.C. § 1677(35). The actual determination of the dumping 
margin requires substantial economic analyses. See, e.g., Raj Bhala, Rethinking Antidumping Law, 29 Geo. Wash. J. Int'l L. & 
Econ. 1, 30-50 (1995). "
1023,10," We recognize that the second step of the Supreme Court's test comes into play only if the petition is objectively baseless and 
therefore without probable cause. Because, as discussed infra, we are satisfied that Ethyl's petition was not ""objectively 
baseless,"" and that Ethyl had probable cause to file its petition, we have no need to discuss Ethyl's subjective intent, which is the 
subject of the second part of the Supreme Court's definition of sham. "
1024,11," In footnote six of PRE, the Court cited HN6[
] Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(3), which allows a federal court to ""relieve a party . . . from a final judgment"" for ""fraud . . . misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party."" The Court also cited Walker 
Process Equip., Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chem. Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 176-77, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247, 86 S. Ct. 347 (1965); id. at 179-
80 (Harlan, J., concurring), in which the Court held that a purported patent-holder could not avoid antitrust liability for his suit 
against an alleged infringer if the purported patent-holder's patent was based upon material misrepresentations."
1024,12," Our approach in requiring that misrepresentations must be material to bar Noerr-Pennington immunity is consistent with the 
two other circuit courts of appeals that have considered this issue. The Ninth Circuit held that Noerr-Pennington immunity does 
not extend to parties who make knowing material misrepresentations in the course of a litigative proceeding. See Kottle v. 
Northwest Kidney Ctrs., 146 F.3d 1056 (9th Cir. 1998) (citing Clipper Exxpress v. Rocky Mountain Motor Tariff, 690 F.2d 1240, 
1260 (9th Cir. 1980)). The District of Columbia Circuit disallowed a Noerr-Pennington defense in an action for common law torts 
because the defendants had made material misrepresentations to state securities regulators.  Whelan v. Abell, 310 U.S. App. 
D.C. 396, 48 F.3d 1247 (D.C. Cir. 1995). Moreover, misrepresentations made to procure a patent must rise to the level of fraud 
in order to cause a patent infringement action to fail -- unethical behavior alone is insufficient.  Nobelpharma AB v. Implant 
Innovations, Inc., 141 F.3d 1059, 1070-71 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (discussing Walker Process Equip., Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chem. 
Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247, 86 S. Ct. 347 (1965)). "
1025,13," See Gerald Metals, Inc. v. United States, 132 F.3d 716, 719-20 (Fed. Cir. 1997); American Spring Wire Corp. v. United States, 
8 C.I.T. 20, 590 F. Supp. 1273, 1276 (C.I.T. 1984); SCM Corp. v. United States, 4 C.I.T. 7, 544 F. Supp. 194, 199-200 (C.I.T. 
1982). "
1026,14," Ethyl provided profitability data for the period 1988 through the first six months of 1991. Among other charges, Cheminor 
alleges that the data for the first six months of 1991 was misrepresented. However, of the charges made by Cheminor, each was 
refuted by Ethyl in its brief to the Court, and in any event, each of Cheminor's charges were deemed to be not material by the 
ITC. See Appellee's Br. at 15-16; infra 168 F.3d 119, 125-126 (discussing the views of the ITC)."
1026,15," Cheminor also alleges that Ethyl made misrepresentations regarding Cheminor's market share that made Cheminor's market 
share look larger than it really was. However, Cheminor was in a better position to inform the ITC and the DOC about its own 
market share, but, as we have noted previously, see supra note 6, Cheminor chose not to furnish the ITC or DOC with its market 
share information."
1026,16," Ethyl noted in its brief that despite attempts to obtain an unredacted version of the Post Conference brief, Cheminor did not 
produce it. Nevertheless, it appears from the redacted version that Cheminor argued to the ITC that it should consider that 
Ethyl's research costs were higher than normal during the first six months of 1991. "
1027,17," We note here that the dissent, in referring to the view of Acting Chairman Anne Brunsdale, does not refute the fact that 
Brunsdale did not rely on Ethyl's assertions of decreased profits. Commissioner Brunsdale's separate opinion itself provides 
evidence of Ethyl's probable cause to file its ITC petition. Indeed, the dissent nowhere even acknowledges that the standard of 
probable cause as announced by the Supreme Court in PRE, 508 U.S. at 62-63, is the crucial test in the determination of the 
applicability of Noerr-Pennington immunity, as we have pointed out. See supra 168 F.3d 119, 122-123. Rather, the attempt by 
the dissent to structure a wholly separate exception to Noerr-Pennington for fraud or misrepresentation, which is nowhere found 
in the jurisprudence, cannot take the place of PRE's required probable cause standard. Thus, the question to be answered in 
this case under the controlling standard is whether by reason of Ethyl's success in having the USTR remove Indian ibuprofen 
from the General System of Preferences list, Cheminor's receipt of subsidies from India, Cheminor's dumping of ibuprofen in the 
United States at less than fair value, and the harm and threat of harm to Ethyl by reason of Cheminor's dumping, Ethyl had 
probable cause to file an AD/CVD petition."
1027,18," The dissent has not recognized that misrepresentations, if indeed they occurred, must be material to be acknowledged in the 
Noerr-Pennington context, as we have established. See supra 168 F.3d 119, 123-124. Even if misrepresentations had been 
made such that Ethyl's allegations regarding its January through June 1991 profitability were unsupported, they were not 
deemed material in the opinions of the Commissioners."
1027,19," Again, the dissent fails to recognize that the USTR's actions gave Ethyl probable cause to file its AD/CVD petition. "
1028,20," Cheminor requested discovery from Ethyl regarding issues of Ethyl's intent. Discovery motions were pending at the time the 
district court granted Ethyl's motion for summary judgment. In light of our affirmance of the District Court's opinion on the ground 
that Ethyl had an objective basis to file its petition, discovery issues as to Ethyl's subjective intent are neither relevant nor 
material."
1028,21," The complaint states that Cheminor Drugs is an Indian company; that Reddy-Cheminor is a New Jersey corporation; and that 
Ethyl is a Virginia corporation."
1028,22," Although the dissent argues that Brownsville did not ""extend the Noerr-Pennington doctrine to state or common law claims,"" 
Dissent at 31, the court in Brownsville did in fact rely on several Noerr doctrine cases to support its holding rejecting a cause of 
action for malicious interference with business relations. In Brownsville, the court stated: "
1029,," Two lines of cases support the Sierra Club decision and that which we uphold here: the defamation cases . . . and the 
Noerr-Pennington cases teaching that the collusive use by competitors of legislative, administrative, or judicial process 
does not, without more, give rise to an anti-trust violation, see Eastern R.R. Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, 365 U.S. 
127, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523 (1961); California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 30 L. Ed. 2d 
642, 92 S. Ct. 609 (1972). Brownsville, 839 F.2d at 160 (underlining added). The court went on to cite to several relevant Noerr cases: In numerous cases, the courts have rejected claims seeking damages for injuries allegedly caused by the defendants' 
actions directed to influencing government action. See, e.g., State of Missouri v. National Organization of Women, 620 
F.2d 1301, 1317 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 842, 66 L. Ed. 2d 49, 101 S. Ct. 122 (1980) (boycott campaign of 
NOW against states not ratifying the ERA was neither tortious nor prohibited by the Sherman Act because 'the right to 
petition is of such importance that it is not an improper interference even where exercised by way of a boycott'); 
Protect our Mountain Environment, Inc. v. District Court, 677 P.2d 1361, 1369 (Colo. 1984) (Noerr-Pennington 
analysis applicable to suit for abuse of process and civil conspiracy); Rudoff v. Huntington Symphony Orchestra, Inc., 
91 Misc. 2d 264, 397 N.Y.S.2d 863 (N.Y. Sup. 1977) ('public policy dictates that the tort of interference not be 
extended to those situations where a citizen petitions an agency of his government'); Bledsoe v. Watson, 30 Cal. App. 
3d 105, 106 Cal. Rptr. 197 (Ct. App. 1973) ('the benefit to the public interest in allowing free challenges to public 
expenditures that may circumvent the electoral process outweighs any detriment that may result to private contracting 
parties from such challenges'). Brownsville has neither distinguished these cases nor cited any authority to support its 
underlying action. . . . Id."
1029,23," After the district court improperly dismissed the state claims in this action, Cheminor refiled its common law state claims in 
New Jersey state court. Ethyl removed that case to federal court. The District Court administratively dismissed this second-filed 
case pending the outcome of this appeal. Because we are affirming the District Court's judgment in the instant case and are 
holding that Noerr-Pennington applies to the state law claims, those claims would be subject to a res judicata defense. Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 8(b). "
1033,1," In addition to its contention that Ethyl misrepresented data for the first six months of 1991, Cheminor also contends that Ethyl 
""intentionally and wrongfully underreported its profits to the ITC by $ 1.5 million dollars (over three years)"" and that Ethyl 
misrepresented its 1990 profits. Appellants' Br. at 14, 16. "
1041,1," The '999 patent is directed to a window covering comprising a plurality of opaque flexible vanes bonded on one side to a first 
sheet of translucent material and on the opposite face of the opposite side to a second sheet of translucent material such that 
the opaque vanes are moved to an open position by relative vertical movement of the first and second sheets."
1041,2," The '217 patent provides for an expandable-collapsible honeycomb structure with longitudinally extending cells. The cells are 
formed from a single length of material such that the front face of one cell is the opposite side of the same piece of material that 
forms the back face of an adjacent cell. "
1042,3," Indeed, the Supreme Court has described patents as a monopoly or a legal monopoly. See Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine 
Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 135, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129, 89 S. Ct. 1562 (1969) (referring to patent as a ""lawful monopoly""); Sears, 
Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co., 376 U.S. 225, 229, 11 L. Ed. 2d 661, 84 S. Ct. 784 (1964) (""HN5[
] The grant of a patent is the 
grant of a statutory monopoly.""); Bement v. National Harrow Co., 186 U.S. 70, 91, 46 L. Ed. 1058, 22 S. Ct. 747 (1902) (""The 
very object of [the patent] law is monopoly . . . .""). But see United States v. Dubilier Condenser Corp., 289 U.S. 178, 186, 53 S. 
Ct. 554, 77 L. Ed. 1114 (1933) where the Court stated: The term monopoly connotes the giving of an exclusive privilege for buying, selling, working, or using a thing which the 
public freely enjoyed prior to the grant. Thus a monopoly takes something from the people. An inventor deprives the public 
of nothing which it enjoyed before his discovery, but gives something of value to the community by adding to the sum of 
human knowledge. (Citations omitted). "
1043,4," In fact, the Federal Circuit has long maintained that there is no tension between antitrust and patent and has rejected the notion 
that a patent should be categorized as a ""monopoly."" In Schenck v. Nortron Corp., 713 F.2d 782 (Fed. Cir. 1983), the court 
stated: A patent, under the statute, is property.  35 U.S.C. § 261. Nowhere in any statute is a patent described as a monopoly. The 
patent right is but the right to exclude others, the very definition of 'property.' That the property right represented by a 
patent, like other property rights, may be used in a scheme violative of antitrust laws creates no 'conflict' between laws 
establishing any of those property rights and the antitrust laws. . . . It is but an obfuscation to refer to a patent as 'the patent 
monopoly' or to describe a patent as an exception to the general rule against monopolies. Id. at 786 n.3 (citation omitted)."
1043,5," The Alarm Device court found the following: Among the various reasons found in the cases supporting the rationale of separate trials of antitrust and patent issues are: 
(1) The issues, documentary proof, and witnesses in the validity-infringement claim are essentially different from those of 
the antitrust-misuse claim; (2) Consideration of all the claims at a single trial is burdensome; (3) The patent validity and 
infringement issues are generally less complex and require less discovery than the antitrust issues, and therefore, are 
ready for trial sooner; (4) The patent issues may be triable to the court while the antitrust claims are triable by jury if "
1044,," demanded; (5) In the usual case separate counsel are retained to try the patent and antitrust claims and separate trials 
serve to economize counsel's time."

1044,6," It should be noted that Comfortex has recently moved to amend its Answer and Counterclaims. Comfortex has added, inter 
alia, allegations of tying, Comfortex's Amended Answer and Counterclaims, PP 33-39, and refusal to deal. Id. at P 40. 
Comfortex's motion to amend is currently pending before this Court. "
1045,7," At this time, conspiracy to monopolize is not a claim in this case."
1045,8," Monopoly power is the power to fix prices or exclude or restrict competition in a relevant market. United States v. E.I. Du Pont 
de Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 391, 394-96, 100 L. Ed. 1264, 76 S. Ct. 994 (1956)."
1045,9," The relevant market must be defined according to both geography and the product or service at issue. See gen., Phillip Areeda 
& D. Turner, Antitrust Law P 517 (1978). The geographic market can be defined locally, regionally, see United States v. 
Columbia Steel Co., 334 U.S. 495, 92 L. Ed. 1533, 68 S. Ct. 1107 (1948), or nationally, see United States v. Aluminum Co. of. 
Am., 148 F.2d 416 (2nd Cir. 1945). The relevant product or service market is defined according to the cross-elasticity of demand 
(substitutability) of other products or services. See Grinnell, 384 U.S. at 570-76; Du Pont, 351 U.S. at 394-404; Times-Picayune 
Pub. Co. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 612 n. 31, 97 L. Ed. 1277, 73 S. Ct. 872 (1953). But see Turner, Antitrust Policy and 
the Cellophane Case, 70 Harv. L. Rev. 281 (1956) (criticizing use of cross-elasticity theory)."
1045,10," Comfortex has also pleaded ""inequitable conduct"" on the part of Hunter Douglas as an affirmative defense. The record does 
not reveal an intention by Comfortex to bring and prove a claim of fraud. Therefore, this Court does not specifically address a 
Walker Process claim of fraud against the PTO. It should be noted, however, that the following analysis is applicable to a Walker 
Process claim as well."
1045,11," This tenet is often referred to as the ""Noerr-Pennington"" doctrine which was developed by the Supreme Court in two seminal 
cases. In Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523 (1961), 
the Court addressed the role of the First Amendment in the context of antitrust law. Finding that the antitrust laws did not 
abrogate the First Amendment, the Court granted immunity from antitrust liability to those who petitioned the government for 
assistance. Shortly thereafter, in United Mine Workers of America v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585 
(1965), the Court held that efforts by a union to influence the Secretary of Labor to establish a minimum wage were protected "
1046,," under Noerr. The Court extended the protection of Noerr to individuals who file lawsuits.  California Motor Transport Co. v. 
Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 510, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642, 92 S. Ct. 609 (1972)."
1046,12, See infra for discussion regarding Comfortex's patent misuse defense. 
1047,13," Comfortex also counterclaims pursuant to New York state law of prima facie tort. In order to make out a claim for prima facie 
tort, Comfortex will have to show that Hunter Douglas maliciously intended harm to Comfortex, without a justification for doing 
so.  Rad Adver. Inc. v. United Footwear Org., Inc., 154 A.D.2d 309, 546 N.Y.S.2d 597, 598 (N.Y. App. Div. 1989); Sommer v. 
Kaufman, 59 A.D.2d 843, 399 N.Y.S.2d 7, 8 (N.Y. App. Div. 1977). If Hunter Douglas succeeds in establishing its infringement 
claim, it may eviscerate Comfortex's claim for prima facie tort because it would tend to show justification. Moreover, Comfortex's 
claims relative to Hunter Douglas's alleged interference with contractual relationships will more than likely disappear if it is shown 
that Comfortex infringed Hunter Douglas's valid patents because, in that case, (1) Comfortex would have no legal right to 
engage in the sale of its infringing product ab initio; and (2) Hunter Douglas's efforts to protect its valid and infringed patent could 
hardly be held to be wrongful. See NBT Bancorp, Inc. v. Fleet/Norstar Fin. Group, 87 N.Y.2d 614, 664 N.E.2d 492, 496, 641 
N.Y.S.2d 581 (N.Y. 1996) (requiring 'wrongful' action as necessary element to tort of interference with prospective contractual 
relationship) (citing Guard-Life Corp. v. S. Parker Hardware Mfg. Corp., 50 N.Y.2d 183, 406 N.E.2d 445, 451, 428 N.Y.S.2d 628 
(N.Y. 1980))."
1047,14," In Laitram Corp. v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 791 F. Supp. 113 (E.D. La. 1992), a case upon which Comfortex relies, the court 
separated a patent infringement trial into three phases: liability, damages, and willful infringement. The court found that because 
of overlapping evidence between patent liability and certain aspects of the damages issue, ""in the damages phase, the parties 
will not have to repeat any evidence relevant to liability that also bears on the reasonable royalty owed."" Id. at 117. This is the 
precise principle applied here relative to Hunter Douglas's request to separate the patent and antitrust issues. "
1049,15," Congress amended the patent law in 1988 such that HN18[
] practices including (1) licensing or deriving revenue from those 
who would otherwise be contributory infringers of the patent, (2) unilaterally refusing to license or use any rights to the patent, 
and (3) enforcing the patent against infringers or contributory infringers cannot be used to support a finding of patent misuse. 35 
U.S.C. § 271(d) (1994). Section (d) was further amended to mandate that even a typing arrangement could not be the basis of a 
patent misuse defense unless the patentee had market power in the relevant market. See id. § 271(d)(5). "

1077,2," CRPUD contends that the state court did not hold a hearing or make findings on the merits of the settlement. See Plaintiff's 
Response, p. 3. While that may be so, CRPUD, represented by counsel, agreed to the Stipulation and the Stipulated Judgment. 
If CRPUD wishes to contest the fairness of its own agreement, that argument should be directed to the state court, which 
expressly retained jurisdiction to resolve such disputes. "
1079,3," Although not alleged in CRPUD's antitrust complaint, there is a related dispute pending before the OPUC concerning the 1986 
OPUC Order approving PGE's sale to CRPUD. The issue is whether that Order resulted in a transfer of the Boise Cascade 
property and facilities to CRPUD, even though the parties clearly never intended that result. To resolve this issue, on February 
12, 1999, PGE filed a Petition for Declaratory Ruling before the OPUC. The Petition seeks a declaration that from the time the "
1080,," OPUC issued Order No. 39026 in 1963 and continuously until today, Boise Cascade has been located within the service territory 
exclusively allocated to PGE. See Defendant's Reply, Exhibit 1."

1087,1," In their Amended Complaint, the Plaintiffs define the Dayton area as Montgomery and Greene Counties. See Doc. # 3 at P 47."
1087,2," BAT is owned by RNI and Richard Ehrenreich, Matt Perry, Christopher Grant and Paul Norman. Those four individuals are 
owners, officers and/or employees of SSI."
1087,3," Since this case is before the Court on a motion to dismiss, the Court derives its recitation of the facts and circumstances giving 
rise to this litigation from the allegations contained in the Plaintiffs' 168-paragraph, 45-page Amended Complaint (Doc. # 3), 
construing those allegations in the manner most favorable to the Plaintiffs."
1087,4," The Plaintiffs do not allege when SSI became interested in locating a minor league franchise in the Dayton area. However, they 
do allege that, in November, 1996, SSI had discussions with officials of the Reds, concerning a waiver of the Reds territorial 
exclusivity. Therefore, the Court surmises that SSI developed its interest sometime either before or during that month."
1087,5," SSI was required to deposit $ 495,000, which was refundable if a sale did not occur."
1087,6," Under that contract, SSI was to pay $ 3,000,000 for that franchise. In addition, half of the $ 495,000 deposit that SSI had made 
when it entered into the option agreement became non-refundable. "
1088,7," The Plaintiffs allege that the agreement was with Rock Newman, rather than RNI, the corporation of which he was the sole 
shareholder. Given that RNI, rather than its owner, is a Plaintiff in this litigation, the Court assumes for present purposes that 
RNI acquired the right to purchase 55% of the Michigan Battle Cats. If that entity did not acquire that right, it would be difficult to 
discern why it is a Plaintiff and how it has been harmed by the allegedly illegal actions of the Defendants."
1088,8," Myers and Dickson are married. Dickson is a member of the Board of Directors of the Midwest League and the principal owner 
of the Lansing Lugnuts, a team in that league."
1088,9," In their Amended Complaint, the Plaintiffs upon occasion allege that Myers was acting through Defendant Dayton Professional 
Baseball Club, LLC (""DPBC""), while in other instances, they merely assert that Myers herself acted. For purposes of 
convenience, the Court will treat Myers and DPBC as one and use Myers to describe both."
1088,10," The Plaintiffs allege that Myers filed both a CIT and an AFR on or about July 31, 1997, despite the fact that earlier in their 
Amended Complaint the Plaintiffs allege that the two types of approval are normally sought in sequential fashion. "
1089,11," The Plaintiffs set forth claims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1985, against Dayton and the DDP, alleging that they acted in 
concert with other Defendants to prevent the Plaintiffs from acquiring the Michigan Battle Cats and moving that franchise to the 
Dayton area, because Rock Newman, the owner of SSI, is an African-American. In addition, the Plaintiffs seek to recover from 
Dayton and the DDP, alleging that they tortiously interfered with existing and prospective business and contractual relationships, 
engaged in a civil conspiracy and made statements upon which the Plaintiffs detrimentally relied."
1089,12," As indicated, the Plaintiffs also set forth claims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1985. In addition, claims under the common law 
of Ohio are plead. Since those claims are not implicated by the Mandalay Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, the Court does not 
describe them further. "
1090,13," The Mandalay Defendants are also named in a number of the Plaintiffs' other claims; however, the Motion to Dismiss is 
directed solely at Counts 1 and 2 of the Amended Complaint."
1090,14," In their Memorandum in Opposition (Doc. # 32), the Plaintiffs also argue that competition between Trotwood and Dayton for a 
team and for a tenant for their respective stadia was restrained by the actions of the Defendants. Since the Plaintiffs have not 
included such allegations in their Amended Complaint, nor have they sought leave so to amend, the Court does not consider 
claims based upon such a theory to be part of this litigation."
1090,15," The Mandalay Defendants do not argue that the Plaintiffs' Sherman Act claim must be dismissed by virtue of the exemption 
from federal antitrust laws that baseball enjoys. See Flood v. Kuhn, 407 U.S. 258, 32 L. Ed. 2d 728, 92 S. Ct. 2099 (1972); 
Toolson v. New York Yankees, Inc., 346 U.S. 356, 98 L. Ed. 64, 74 S. Ct. 78 (1953); Federal Baseball Club of Baltimore v. 
National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, 259 U.S. 200, 66 L. Ed. 898, 42 S. Ct. 465 (1922). Therefore, the Court does 
not address that issue."
1090,16," In Brunswick, the plaintiff had alleged that the defendant had violated § 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18, which prohibits 
anti-competitive mergers, by purchasing a bowling alley with which the plaintiff was in competition and which would have gone "
1091,," out of business if the defendant had not purchased it. Since the defendant's transaction fostered rather than restrained 
competition, the Supreme Court concluded that the plaintiff had not, as a result, suffered an antitrust injury."
1091,17," In Atlantic Richfield, the plaintiff, an independent retailer of gasoline, alleged that defendant, an integrated marketer of 
petroleum products, had violated § 1 of the Sherman Act, by engaging in a vertical conspiracy with its dealers to set maximum 
retail prices for gasoline above the predatory level. (""Predatory pricing may be defined as pricing below an appropriate measure 
of cost for the purpose of eliminating competitors in the short run and reducing competition in the long run."" Cargill, Inc. v. 
Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 117, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427, 107 S. Ct. 484 (1986)). Since the alleged conspiracy fostered 
competition by reducing the price of gasoline to consumers (the defendant was alleged to have conspired with its dealers to set 
a maximum price for gasoline, i.e., a ceiling or price above which its dealers were not permitted to charge consumers, which had 
caused the plaintiff to reduce the price that it charged consumers, thus injuring the plaintiff by preventing it from charging higher 
prices), the Supreme Court concluded that the plaintiff had not suffered an antitrust injury. "
1093,18," Moreover, in Brunswick, the Supreme Court stressed that an antitrust injury is an ""injury of the type the antitrust laws were 
intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful"" and that the ""injury should reflect the 
anticompetitive effect either of the violation or of anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation."" 495 U.S. at 334. In Atlantic 
Richfield, the Supreme Court noted that an injury, ""although casually related to an antitrust violation, nevertheless will not qualify 
as 'antitrust injury,' unless it is attributable to an anticompetitive aspect of the practice under scrutiny."" 495 U.S. at 334. Herein, it 
was always anticipated that the group, which was chosen to bring minor league baseball to the Dayton area, would be a 
monopolist in that product and geographic market, regardless of whether the Plaintiffs, the Mandalay Defendants or some other 
group prevailed. It was always understood that there would be no competition among minor league baseball teams in this 
market. Since such competition would not exist, the Plaintiffs have not suffered an injury as a result of an anticompetitive act, 
effect or aspect. "
1094,19, One of the defendants was also part owner of that facility.
1094,20," In Directory Sales Management Corp. v. Ohio Bell Telephone Co., 833 F.2d 606 (6th Cir. 1987), the Sixth Circuit discussed 
the essential facility doctrine: The refusal to give competitors reasonable access to an essential facility is a form of anticompetitive behavior that will 
support a claim of monopolization. See Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 375, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359, 93 S. 
Ct. 1022 (1973). The essential facility doctrine, also called the bottleneck principle, states that where facilities cannot 
practicably be duplicated by would-be competitors, those in possession of them must allow them to be shared on fair terms. 
It is illegal restraint of trade to foreclose [use of] the scarce facility."
1094,833," F.2d at 612 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). See also, Mid-South Grizzlies, 720 F.2d at 787 (concluding 
admission to a sports league is not an essential facility). Thus, the majority in Fishman concluded that the Chicago Stadium was 
an essential facility, because it was the only location in the Chicago area where professional basketball could be played, and, 
further, since it would have been impractical to duplicate that facility."
1094,21," See also, Clorox Co. v. Sterling Winthrop, Inc., 117 F.3d 50, 57 (2nd Cir. 1997) (""The antitrust laws protect consumers by 
preventing agreements that unreasonably restrain overall competition""); Ehredt Underground, Inc. v. Commonwealth Edison, 90 
F.3d 238, 240 (7th Cir. 1996) (""antitrust [laws are] designed to protect consumers""); SCFC ILC, Inc. v. Visa USA, Inc., 36 F.3d 
958, 972 (10th Cir. 1994) (same). Thus, in Brunswick, the plaintiff had not suffered an antitrust injury, because consumers would 
be helped by the competition that would continue as a result of the defendant's merger that allegedly violated § 7 Of the Clayton 
Act. In Atlantic Richfield, the plaintiff had not suffered an antitrust injury, because consumers would benefit from the increased 
competition that would result from the defendant's vertical conspiracy to set maximum retail prices above a predatory level."
1094,22," It bears emphasis that the dispute between Judge Easterbrook and the majority in Fishman was over the aspect of the 
plaintiffs' antitrust claims predicated upon the defendants' violation of the essential facilities doctrine, by refusing to agree to "
1095,," lease the Chicago Stadium to the plaintiffs. Judge Easterbrook concluded that the plaintiffs had not suffered an antitrust injury. 
Herein, the Plaintiffs do not allege that the Mandalay Defendants or any other Defendant similarly violated that doctrine."
1095,23," In most conclusory fashion, the Plaintiffs allege that the public has been denied the benefits of competition, free from the 
allegedly illegal restraints of which they complain. However, the Plaintiffs do not allege how that denial has caused consumers to 
be harmed. See In re DeLorean, 991 F.2d at 1240 (explaining that, although Rule 12(b)(6) incorporates a liberal standard, ""it 
requires more than the bare assertion of legal conclusions"")."
1095,24," The Plaintiffs rely upon Piazza v. Major League Baseball, 831 F. Supp. 420 (E.D.Pa. 1993). Therein, the plaintiffs alleged, 
inter alia, that the defendants had violated the Sherman Act by refusing to allow them to purchase the San Francisco Giants and 
move that franchise to Tampa, Florida. The District Court overruled the defendants' motion to dismiss, concluding that the 
plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged that there had been harm to competition in the relevant market, to wit: the market for the 
ownership of professional baseball franchises, generally, and the San Francisco Giants, in particular. Herein, the Plaintiffs also 
allege that the relevant market is for the ownership of minor league baseball franchises. However, assuming that the Plaintiffs 
have alleged that the Defendants harmed competition in that market, the Court nevertheless cannot conclude that they have 
alleged that they have suffered an antitrust injury, since they have not alleged facts that would support a finding that consumers 
were harmed as a result. Since the Court follows Judge Easterbrook's persuasive analysis which focuses upon the question of 
whether the defendants' actions have caused harm to the consumers, it declines to follow Piazza. Indeed, in that litigation, the 
District Court did not consider whether the alleged anticompetitive actions of the defendants had caused harm to consumers. It 
bears emphasis that antitrust laws were designed ""to protect consumers from producers, not to protect producers from each 
other or to ensure that one firm gets more of the business."" Ehredt Underground, 90 F.3d at 240. The Plaintiffs' antitrust claims 
are not premised on the theory that the Defendants' illegal actions harmed consumers. Rather, the Plaintiffs, as one group 
seeking to become the ""producer"" of minor league baseball in the Dayton area, allege that the other potential producer has 
acted in concert and conspired with the Midwest League, the NAPBL and others to prevent them (Plaintiffs) from becoming the 
producer of minor league baseball in the Dayton area. Thus, the Plaintiffs seek to use the antitrust laws to protect them from 
other producers, rather than to protect the interests of consumers. "
1096,25," Since the Court so concludes, it is not necessary to address the Mandalay Defendants' alternative arguments that the Plaintiffs 
have failed to allege adequately that they (the Mandalay Defendants) engaged in a conspiracy or concerted action or that they 
possessed monopoly power."
1096,26," Although only the Mandalay Defendants, have moved for dismissal of the Plaintiffs' antitrust claims, the Court cannot conceive 
that those claims, as they are presently drafted and as they relate to the other Defendants, retain viability, in light of the Decision 
herein. Accordingly, the Court directs the other Defendants, except Dayton and the DDP, which are not named in the 
Defendants' antitrust claims, to move for dismissal of same, within 20 days from date. "

advancement, are impossible to effectively enforce, encourage violations and grievances, pit chapter and local union 
against local union, fly in the face of market trends and are of doubtful legality. . . . The Labor Committee should resist the 
spread of provisions that go beyond legitimate protection of traditional work, and seek other remedies to level the playing 
field. Aff. of James Barriere, Ex. A (excerpt from Board of Directors Policy Statement). "

1108,7," HN5[
] Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act provide in relevant part: Section 1. Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce 
among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal. . . . Section 2. Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or 
person, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be 
deemed guilty of a felony. . . ."
1108,15, U.S.C. § 1 (West 1997). 
1109,8," Defendants contend, in large part, that the disputed clause is protected by the nonstatutory exemption because it is a valid 
work preservation clause under section 8(e). See Def. Local 38 Mem. of Law at 11; Def. Local 38 SENY Contractors at 23-24."
1109,9," Recognizing the applicability of the nonstatutory exemption, defendants' argue that the disputed clause falls within that 
exemption to the antitrust laws. See Def. Local 38 Mem. of Law at 10; Def. Local 38 SENY Contractors Mem. of Law at 20. "
1110,10," Significantly, defendants do not allege that the other elements of a cause of action under sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act 
are not met. "
1121,1," The current appeal system utilizing the Management Council has only been in effect since 1996. However, there has been a 
right to appeal a decision of the Membership Services group since 1977."
1121,2," Prior to January 1, 1998, if an appeal was denied by the Interpretations Committee, proposed legislation would not be 
considered by the NCAA until the next annual meeting in January of the following year. "
1123,3," Due to Adidas' failure to establish two of the preliminary injunction elements, the court would deny Adidas' request for 
preliminary injunctive relief even if the injunction sought was not disfavored, and Adidas' was not required to show that the four 
factors weigh heavily and compellingly in its favor. "
1125,4," The Tenth Circuit has not addressed this issue. In Law v. NCAA, the court held that horizontal price-fixing agreements among 
NCAA members should be analyzed under the rule of reason rather than the per se rule.  134 F.3d 1010, 1018-19 (10th Cir.), 
cert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 65 (1998). The court did not, however, provide any guidance on drawing lines between those 
agreements properly defined as commercial activities and those considered noncommercial and, therefore, not subject to the 
antitrust laws. "
1126,5," NCAA v. Board of Regents of the Univ, of Okla., 468 U.S. 85, 120, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1984)."
1126,6," In Board of Regents, the Supreme Court also cited with approval, College Athletic Placement Serv., 1974 WL 998, which held 
that the antitrust laws do not apply to NCAA eligibility rules. This case was affirmed by the Third Circuit and is consistent with the 
Third Circuit's holding in Smith, 139 F.3d 180."
1126,7, Section 2.9 of the NCAA's constitution provides: 
1127,," Student-athletes shall be amateurs in an intercollegiate sport, and their participation should be motivated primarily by 
education and by the physical, mental, and social benefits to be derived. Student participation in intercollegiate athletics is 
an avocation, and student-athletes should be protected from exploitation by professional and commercial enterprises."
1127,8," Adidas' briefing focuses almost solely on the issue of whether 12.5.5 is necessary and whether its application is reasonable. 
Adidas fails to recognize that Bylaw 12.5.5 does not violate antitrust laws merely because it is potentially unnecessary, over-
restrictive, or unfairly applied to Adidas."
1127,9," NCAA Football is a tax exempt 501(c)(3) corporation made up of the NCAA, the American Football Coaches Association, 
NACDA (the athletic directors' association) and the Conference Commissioners' Association. NCAA Football is an effort to 
create awareness for and promote the game of college football. NCAA Football asks, but does not require, conferences to have 
their members place the NCAA Football mark on helmets and jerseys. "
1135,1," It appears that defendant TPG as an entity was not a signatory to the Purchase Agreement entered into for the sale of AT&T 
Paradyne on or about June 18, 1996. Rather, the Purchase Agreement was signed by representatives of five entities, each 
having some interconnection with defendant TPG. However, plaintiffs have named only TPG as a defendant in this matter 
because that is the entity which was the ultimate purchaser of AT&T Paradyne. This discrepancy was noted at oral argument, 
whereupon plaintiffs' counsel indicated that it was a distinction without a difference for purposes of this motion. (See Tr. of Hr'g 
at 21-22.) Defendants appear to agree with plaintiffs on this point. (See AT&T's Mem. in Supp. at 3 n.2.) Accordingly, for ease of 
reference, the Court will adopt the parties' designation of TPG as indicating the entity which purchased AT&T Paradyne. "
1136,2," As explained in the text, if a Paradyne employee was identified as an ""at risk"" employee, the AT&T preliminary net did not apply 
to that person. Accordingly, internal memoranda provided in discovery indicate that those Paradyne employees identified as ""at 
risk"" were to be given first priority in consideration for available jobs within AT&T. (Crowley Certif., Ex. C: Memorandum dated 
11-30-95 from Human Resource Deployment Control Center to ""HR Leaders."") The reductions in staff implemented in 
connection with the Force Management Plan, and the ""at risk"" employees identified as such in connection with the Force 
Management Plan, are not the subject of this lawsuit."
1136,3," The AT&T Trivestiture was announced approximately two days after the AT&T preliminary net was put into place. (Melio Certif. 
P 4.)"
1136,4," Lucent was originally known as NS-MPG, Inc., and was a wholly-owned subsidiary of AT&T until April 1996. NS-MPG, Inc.'s 
name was changed to Lucent Technologies Inc. on February 6, 1996. In April 1996, AT&T sold approximately 15 percent of 
Lucent stock. Thus, AT&T was still at that point a majority shareholder in Lucent. Lucent remained a majority-owned subsidiary 
of AT&T until in or about October 1996, at which point it became an independent company."
1136,5, The exact contours of the AT&T defined benefits plan are not specified in the record. 
1137,6," The parties do not delve into the exact nature of the benefits offered by the new Paradyne to the former employees of AT&T 
Paradyne post-sale. We have reviewed the record and found limited information relating to the benefits and pension plans 
offered to employees of the new Paradyne. A memorandum issued on June 19, 1996 from the new Paradyne's future CEO 
indicates the company's intentions regarding pension and benefits plans, but that memorandum does not reflect the status of 
those plans post-closing. For example, the memo states that the benefits plans offered by the new Paradyne were going to be 
""substantially similar, and in some cases improved."" (Crowley Certif. Ex. G.: Memorandum from Tom Epley to ""The People of 
Pardyne"" dated 6-19-96."") It also indicates that the employees' participation in AT&T pension plans, the AT&T retiree medical 
plan and other benefits associated with retirement, would be ""discontinued going forward."" It states further that ""we have created 
a new Retirement Savings Plan,"" and then sets forth the particulars of that new plan. It thus appears that the acquirer intended 
that the employees' participation in the AT&T pension plan would be discontinued as of the date of the sale, and that those 
employees would then be covered by a new pension plan developed by the new Paradyne. (Id.) This information, however, contradicts statements in plaintiffs' Complaint regarding pension plan opportunities at the new 
Paradyne post-closing. Paragraph 47 of the Daley Complaint indicates that certain plaintiffs were at the time of the filing of the 
Complaint, still employed at the new Paradyne. The Complaint further states that their employment at the new Paradyne did not 
include any type of pension plan. (Daley Compl. P 47.)"
1137,7," Alternatively, throughout this Opinion, the pre-closing net and the post-closing net may be referred to either separately or 
collectively as the ""no-hire agreement"" or ""no-hire agreements."""
1137,8," Plaintiffs point out that even if certain Paradyne employees were terminated after the closing date, or if they did not make more 
than $ 50,000, thus exempting them from the post-closing net, those employees seeking reemployment with AT&T or Lucent 
would not be given preference, nor would they be able to participate in the job replacement program in place at the two 
companies in connection with the AT&T Trivestiture. Those former AT&T Paradyne employees would be treated as ""external 
hires."" (Crowley Certif., Ex. I.) "
1138,9," Section 7.4(a)(i) of AT&T's Management Pension Plan provides in pertinent part: Breaks in Service Except to the extent provided in Section 8, the following rules in Section 7.4(a)-(f) shall apply to all Employees in all cases. a. General Provisions--except for Pension Plan Participation and Vested Pension Eligibility (i) Any absence from the service without pay, including any period during which a person is employed by a Former Affiliate 
unless transferred to or reemployed by a Participating Company . . . [other than circumstances not here applicable] . . . 
shall be considered as a break in the continuity of service and if any person is reemployed after such a break in the 
continuity of his or her service, the individual's Term of Employment shall be reckoned from the date of such reemployment; 
provided, however, that (1) any break in the continuity of or absence from the service that does not exceed 6 months shall 
be considered as a leave of absence if return to active service from such an absence occurs on or after October 1, 1980, 
and (2) any break in the continuity of or absence from service shall be considered as a leave of absence upon completion 
by an Employee, who had previously completed six months of continuous service, of 5 years of continuous service after 
termination of the absence. (Arnold Aff., Ex. C.)"
1138,10," We understand plaintiffs' ERISA claim to be brought only against defendants AT&T and Lucent as plaintiffs' former employers. 
Plaintiffs have not provided any clarification on this point, and our reading of the Complaint confirms that the gravamen of the § 
510 claim rests upon plaintiffs' rights under the AT&T pension plan, and AT&T and Lucent's alleged interference with those 
rights by the adoption and implementation of the 245-day no hiring agreement. We will analyze the merits of plaintiffs' § 510 with 
that understanding of the structure of the § 510 claim. "
1139,11," The Daley plaintiffs raise an additional claim under ERISA. Plaintiffs assert that defendants AT&T and Lucent violated ERISA 
by not permitting Paradyne employees subject to the preliminary, pre- and post-closing nets to participate in the job replacement 
program which was established after the announcement of the AT&T Trivestiture. That program instituted a centralized job 
posting which assisted dislocated employees in obtaining replacement jobs within the AT&T, NCR and Lucent organizations. 
(Daley Compl. P 59.) This claim will be examined separately in the Discussion Section, II, B, infra."
1139,12," The parties have diligently advanced several positions in support of their various claims and in response to their adversaries' 
arguments. We recognize that some of these contentions are not discussed in the text of this Opinion. However, we have fully 
considered all of the arguments raised both in the written submissions and during the extended oral argument before this Court. 
In the interest of brevity and clarity, we have limited our discussion to those arguments we deem central to our holding in this 
case. See Gavalik, v. Continental Can Co., 812 F.2d 834, 838 n.2 (3d Cir. 1987) (following similar structure and approach in the 
context of an appeal of a judgment entered for the defendants under § 510 of ERISA). "
1140,13," To the extent that plaintiffs attempted to assert in their Complaints a § 1 violation based upon the AT&T preliminary net, such a 
claim would be precluded by the Supreme Court's decision and reasoning in Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., "
1141,467," U.S. 752, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984) and its progeny. As of October 18, 1995, the date that the preliminary 
net was put in effect by AT&T, Lucent was a wholly-owned subsidiary of AT&T, and accordingly, the two companies were a 
singular entity that could not conspire to violate the antitrust laws. See supra note 4. Moreover, the evidence demonstrates that 
the AT&T preliminary net was put into place prior to any negotiations with TPG. (Fabian Certif. P 10, Ex. I at 6; Melio Certif. P 6.)"
1141,14," Plaintiffs' protestations notwithstanding, it is clear that this case must be governed by a rule of reason analysis rather than 
simply labeling defendants' conduct as a ""group boycott"" and thus subjecting the pre-closing and post-closing nets to per se 
treatment under the antitrust laws. HN5[
] The per se approach has generally been limited to those ""classic"" group boycott 
cases in which a group of competitors seeks to economically benefit by excluding other competitors from the marketplace. See 
Larry V. Muko, Inc. v. Southwestern Pa. Bldg. and Const. Trades Council, 670 F.2d 421, 429-30 (3d Cir. 1982). For an 
agreement to be deemed per se illegal, it must be shown to have a ""pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming 
virtue. . . ."" Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545, 78 S. Ct. 514 (1958). Accordingly, the per se 
rule of illegality should be applied only to ""naked restraints of trade with no purpose except stifling of competition."" White Motor 
Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 263, 9 L. Ed. 2d 738, 83 S. Ct. 696 (1963). Here, it is clear that the no-hire agreements at 
issue qualify as ancillary restraints, and are thus subject to a rule of reason analysis. Our research has uncovered only two 
cases in which a plaintiff has attempted to base an antitrust claim upon a no-hire agreement made in connection with the sale of 
a business such as the ones executed in connection with the Paradyne sale. In both cases, the courts rejected the plaintiffs' 
attempts to invoke a per se analysis. See Coleman v. General Elec. Co., 643 F. Supp. 1229 (E.D. Tenn. 1986), aff'd, 822 F.2d 
59 (6th Cir. 1987); Cesnik v. Chrysler Corp., 490 F. Supp. 859 (M.D. Tenn. 1980). Moreover, we reject plaintiffs' argument that 
those cases are inapposite because they are factually distinguishable from this case. To the extent that those cases present 
slightly different factual scenarios from the instant case, we find that those distinctions have no bearing on the applicability of the 
holdings to the present suit. "
1143,15," Plaintiffs argue that the no-hire agreements at issue are not ancillary restraints because AT&T was a third party to the 
Lucent/TPG sale of Paradyne, and the pre-closing and post-closing nets applied to AT&T as well as Lucent. (Pls.' Br. in Supp. at 
37.) ""In other words, [for AT&T], the boycott wasn't ancillary to anything, but was simply a naked restraint of trade."" (Id. at 38.) 
Such an assertion is belied by the facts as well as the practical realities of the transaction which occurred. First, we note that 
plaintiffs' characterization of AT&T as a third party is erroneous in light of the fact that Lucent was a majority-owned subsidiary of 
AT&T during the relevant time period. Moreover, it is equally obvious that AT&T's participation in the pre-closing and post-
closing nets was necessary to accomplish the sale of Paradyne, as AT&T had recently owned Paradyne outright. Plaintiffs also 
attempt to argue that the no-hire agreements were independent of the Paradyne sale transaction. (Pls.' Br. in Opp'n at 30-31.) 
This assertion is contradicted by the plain language of the Purchase Agreement, which in no uncertain terms includes the pre-
closing net in its provisions, and further states that at the closing, the parties will execute, inter alia, the Employee Matters 
Agreement. (Reply Aff. of David Michael Fabian (""Fabian Certif. II""), Ex. A: Purchase Agreement P 1.8 ""Additional Agreements""; 
Arnold Aff., Ex. A: Purchase Agreement P 4.5 ""Prohibition on Hiring."")"
1143,16," Plaintiffs make much of the fact that the practical effect of the 245-day time limitation meant that former employees of the old 
Paradyne lost their ""bridging rights"" which were granted to them under the AT&T/Lucent pension plan unless they remained 
reemployed at AT&T for five years. Plaintiffs condemn this effect, noting for example that ""the acts of defendant impinged on the 
economic freedom of each and every plaintiff and denied them the opportunity to be considered by AT&T or Lucent."" (Pls.' Br. in 
Supp. at 11.) The short answer to plaintiffs' argument is that they have presented no evidence to the Court which demonstrates 
that defendants' purpose in agreeing to a 245-day time period was to stifle competition in the relevant employment market and 
foster a monopoly. Put simply, plaintiffs ask this Court to draw the inference that the defendants must have intended to stifle "
1144,," competition based upon the fact that the no-hire provision foreclosed bridging for 5 years. Such an inference without supportive 
evidence is unreasonable. This observation, however, does not prohibit a finding that the 245-day no-hire agreement violated § 
510 of ERISA. The focus of § 510 is whether defendants intended to interfere with the employees' rights under the AT&T 
pension plan and also whether defendants had the specific intent to violate ERISA. Thus the inquiry under § 510 is not whether 
defendants intended to stifle competition in the relevant market. (See Discussion, II.,A., infra.)"
1144,17," Our own independent evaluation of the legal principles governing the determination of the relevant product and geographic 
markets demonstrates that the appropriate market for consideration is the market for the services of those employees affected 
by the agreement. See Queen City Pizza v. Domino's Pizza, Inc., 124 F.3d 430, 438 (3d Cir. 1997) (noting that the ""test for a 
relevant market is not commodities reasonably interchangeable by a particular plaintiff, but commodities reasonably 
interchangeable by consumers for the same purposes"") Here, the commodity at issue is plaintiffs' services, and the issue of the 
relevant market must be determined from the standpoint of the consumer rather than the supplier. See Tunis Bros. Co., Inc. v. 
Ford Motor Co., 952 F.2d 715, 722 (3d Cir. 1991) (relevant product market defined as those commodities reasonably 
interchanged by consumers for the same purposes). The evidence demonstrates that as to those plaintiffs which have been 
described as ""technically proficient,"" there are at any given time ""up to 20 DSL technology companies and an even larger 
number of network service providers who actively compete for employees with the skills and training possessed by those 
plaintiffs."" (Melio Certif. II P 9.) In contrast, plaintiffs argue that the product market should be limited ""to producers and providers 
of sophisticated telephone and data communications systems and products."" (Certif. of Roger Kiang P 8; Huckins Certif., Ex. A: 
Interrogatory no. 5.) However, even assuming that the product market were limited as plaintiffs suggest, there are several 
companies which fall into that category. As to the plaintiffs with more generalized educational and work backgrounds, the 
product market for their services is broader. In fact, the evidence shows that those plaintiffs are qualified to perform a vast 
number of jobs, and that the market for those services is nationwide. (See Weber Aff. P 6 (noting that plaintiffs' responses to 
interrogatories suggest that certain plaintiffs have found jobs in several parts of the United States before, during and after 
employment with Paradyne); see also id., Ex. D: Interrogatories of Gilbert Daley at no. 3; id., Ex. D: Interrogatories of Susan 
DiBona at no. 3; id., Ex. D: Interrogatories of Thomas Salisbury at no. 3; compare id., Ex. D: Interrogatories of Beth King at no. 3 
with King Certif. P 2; compare Certif. of Lawrence Walsh P 2 with Weber Aff, Ex. D: Interrogatories of Lawrence Walsh at no. 3).) "
1145,18," Here, the Eichorn plaintiffs define the relevant market for plaintiffs' services to be ""potential employers within a 35-mile radius 
of Holmdel/Middletown with the capacity and capability of employing or utilizing large numbers of persons with specialized 
experience in high speed data communications equipment of the sort Paradyne develops and makes. . . who can provide 
continuity of the pension benefits which have accrued to . . . [plaintiffs] under the AT&T and/or Lucent pension plans."" (Eichorn 
Compl. PP 13, 14.) In the Daley Complaint, plaintiffs allege that ""job opportunities within commuting distance of their present 
homes serves to define potential product and geographic markets as a supplement and alternative to a market defined by 
pension continuity."" (Daley Compl. P 29.) Put simply, plaintiffs have alleged a product and geographic market that would permit 
plaintiffs only to provide their services to AT&T and/or Lucent."
1145,19," We read this aspect of plaintiffs' § 510 claim to be premised only upon the adoption and implementation of the post-closing net 
because plaintiffs' bridging rights were affected only by virtue of the fact that the post-closing net was in place for 8 months and 
the AT&T pension plan only permitted bridging if the separation in service were for 6 months or less. Plaintiffs were not "
1146,," separated from the employ of AT&T and/or Lucent until the date of the closing such that the alleged ""interference"" with plaintiffs' 
bridging rights under the AT&T pension plan did not commence until plaintiffs were unable to seek employment with AT&T and 
Lucent post-closing. "
1147,20," We recognize that at most, plaintiffs seek additional discovery relating to the author of the handwritten notes and the meaning 
of the rather ""cryptic"" discussion about pension bridging. (See Crowley Rule 56(f) Certif. P 10.) Viewed in the light most 
favorable to plaintiffs, the information contained therein could be interpreted such that it appears that the author was not only 
cognizant of the effect of a longer term post-closing net, but that such a result would be desirable because it would ensure that 
the new Paradyne's employees would have a reduced incentive to attempt to leave the new Paradyne right away. Such 
evidence, if admissible, would clearly be relevant to plaintiffs' § 510 claim. While we will not entertain plaintiffs' discovery 
requests in the context of these dispositive motions, we advise that plaintiffs may make an application before Magistrate Judge 
Wolfson for additional discovery, such as to ascertain the author and meaning of the notes. "
1150,21," This claim will not be determined by a jury. HN14[
] There is no right to a jury trial for a claim under Section 510 of ERISA. Cox v. Keystone Carbon Co., 894 F.2d 647, 649 (3d Cir. 1990); Cox v. Keystone Carbon Co., 861 F.2d 390, 394 (3d Cir. 1988); 
Turner v. CF & I Steel Corp., 770 F.2d 43, 46-47 (3d Cir. 1985). "
1194,1," The findings of fact contained in the following discussion are those which the court finds have been presented in a manner 
consistent with Fed.R.Civ.Pr. 56 and D.Kan.R. 56.1. To the extent certain proposed findings by the parties are not included 
herein, it is because the court has found that the supporting pleadings and evidentiary materials wholly fail to provide support for 
the assertions, reflect hearsay or unsupported opinions, or fail to comply with Rule 56.1. In particular, the court notes the 
plaintiffs' frequent failure to provide record references in compliance with the rule. Thus, in their response to defendants' Fact P 
289, plaintiffs simply state ""See Plfs' SOF 188-382,"" thereby incorporating 195 of the paragraphs in their independent statement 
of facts. This is hardly the short and concise reference to the record required by the rule. The court must also note there are significant problems with plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment. The plaintiffs 
repeatedly assert, as alleged uncontroverted facts, matters which have no evidentiary support. Further, almost the entirety of the 
allegedly uncontroverted facts, as well as the argument (Plf. Br. at 14-62) are directed at only one of the causes of action on "
1195,," which the plaintiffs seek summary judgment: tortious interference with contract. The argument in support of the remaining four 
claims (tortious interference with business expectancy, misappropriation of trade secrets, unfair competition, and breach of the 
confidentiality agreement) are then summarily advanced in the last five pages of the brief (Id. at 63-68). Following the 
defendants' response, the plaintiffs then support these remaining four claims with some 45 pages of argument in their reply. (Plf. 
Reply at 52-97). This sort of pleading, which leaves virtually all of the argument until the reply brief, denying the nonmovant any 
chance to respond, is not consistent with any proper rebuttal."
1195,2," Plaintiffs allege that this higher degree of profitability is due to its high charges and lower costs. (Plf. Resp. at 23, P 141). But 
the same authority -- plaintiffs' expert -- elsewhere suggests that Wesley's profitability is simply because it ""is a more efficient 
(lower cost) provider than Via Christi."" (Plf. Exh. 137, at 22, P 36). "
1196,3," See pp. 15-17, infra."
1196,4," The Management and Operating Agreement provides that IHS, formerly Wichita Clinic Building Company, Inc., is owned by the 
physicians affiliated with the Clinic. IHS ""is engaged in the business of owning and leasing buildings and equipment to the Clinic 
and managing professional medical practices."" (Def. Exh. 4, at 1). The Agreement was created out of the desire of the Clinic and 
IHS ""to create an integrated system that will provide increased efficiency, improved services to Wichita Clinic patients, and lower 
operating costs of the Clinic, as well as develop skills in providing managed care."" (Id.)"
1196,5," Plaintiffs have stressed that Wesley was the only formal bidder for the Blue Cross hospital contract in 1992. There is no 
evidence, however, that Wesley will be the sole bidder on future Blue Cross contracts. There is evidence that Blue Cross was 
able to use the threat of contracting with other providers to negotiate steep discounts from Wesley. The plaintiffs cite rough estimates performed by Todd Dougan which indicated that the loss of Blue Cross business could cost 
defendants $ 24 million in pretax earnings. In order to keep Blue Cross at Wesley exclusively, a deal to bring Wichita Clinic and 
Blue Cross together was imperative. It is uncontroverted that Wesley's strategy was defensive in that it sought to avoid a loss of 
Blue Cross's business to Via Christi. "
1197,6," In his deposition, Tom Kelly stated the 30 to 35 million dollar figure was ""a take-it-or-leave-it number"" unless Wesley ""could 
convince us otherwise."" (Def. Exh. 13, at 151). Kelly explicitly denied making a ""considered evaluation of the Clinic."" (Id. at 147). 
Asked about how he came up with the figure, Kelly testified: I worked with the Clinic to decide and advised them as follows: That, one, the valuation techniques used in establishing the 
value of the Clinic were such that they could conceivably arrive at a range of values that were well beyond what they'd be 
willing to accept in terms of culminating a transaction; that they, like me, had ample experience and knowledge of pending 
and completed transactions in the market; that the real key to the value of the Clinic really was two items -- one was the 
potential margin to be generated by the Clinic, and the second was the multiple that the purchaser was willing to attach to 
that potential margin; that both of those could be set in a reasonably finite way without the usual fanfare of valuations and 
without the usual confusion that resulted from competing valuations. The reason that you can set a 30 to 35 million dollar value on this transaction is we know the current size of the business, 
about $ 75 million a year; we know what a margin -- what margin would be delivered, assuming a 3 or 4 percent margin "
1198,," parameter; we can choose a capitalization level; all without a more formal, more detailed, and probably far less useful 
valuation process. …. But the answer is, it wasn't meant as an estimate that the valuation was going to inform. It was meant as a fundamental 
agreement that this business, and that the transaction value for this business, would be set based upon an agreed-upon 
multiple and an agreed-upon margin level well in advance of valuation procedures which were meant to benefit not either 
the Clinic or Wesley, but outside parties that might inspect the transaction. (Id., at 148-50)."
1198,7," Dotson's memo defines ""Enterprise Value"" as ""what we can do together given the potential of IHS/Newco,"" and concludes ""this 
value of hoped for earnings potential is not the key value which will determine what we should be willing to invest."" (Def. Exh. 
51)."
1198,8," Dotson wrote: If the profits of the new company are shared disproportionately with the physicians, i.e., they keep all profits in excess of 
3%, the value goes down by at least $ 6-8 million. If the risk-sharing pool concept does not get into the definitives per 
discussions yesterday, and/or if the doctors cannot manage care at the hospital with us to create those savings, then 
another $ 6 mm of value is at risk. (Def. Exh. 52). "
1199,9," This Letter of Intent is a separate agreement from the Letter of Agreement signed August 29, 1994. "
1202,10," The plaintiffs suggest that Wesley had already disavowed any interest in investing in Premier Blue, and that it lacked the ability 
to make such an investment. But the cited evidence for the former, the testimony of Knack, is uncertain as to the time of this 
alleged disavowal, whether it was before or after the collapse of negotiations between Wichita Clinic and Wesley. As to the 
latter, Jim Kelly explicitly testified that Wesley was willing and able to make such an investment. The evidence which is offered to 
controvert this only suggests that Wesley might suffer a delay in making such an investment, not that it was barred from doing 
so. "
1203,11," The plaintiffs seek to characterize Morgan's comments at the June 5 meeting as an expression of an intent to gain ""full 
acquisition"" of the Clinic. (Plf. Resp. at 130, P 213). There is no evidentiary support for such a conclusion. Indeed, Perkins' 
deposition testimony is directly inconsistent with the attempted portrait of Morgan's comments as reflecting an attempt by Wesley 
to ""acquire"" the Clinic. Rather, Perkins states that Morgan simply proposed a ""combining of all of the assets and liabilities"" into 
the joint venture, with ""the physicians taking some sort of an ownership in the hospital organization."" (Def. Exh. 186, Perkins 
dep. at 476-77). "
1204,12," As one of their uncontroverted facts, plaintiffs assert that in the fall of 1995 Columbia/HCA Chief Operating Officer David 
Vandewater summoned Wesley's Chief Executive Officer, Jim Kelly, to Nashville. Vandewater told Kelly the hospital wasn't as 
profitable as they wanted, even though it had met all the goals previously set. According to Kelly, ""they wanted Wesley to be the 
first hundred-million-dollar earning hospital in the country."" (Kelly dep. at 63-64). The plaintiffs bring forth this incident in the 
context of their discussion of an alleged motive of Wesley to purchase the Clinic rather than partner with it, and thus that their 
negotiations were conducted in bad faith. Significantly, however, the evidence relates to the fall of 1995 -- after Wichita Clinic 
had rejected continuing negotiations concerning the joint venture. "
1206,13," In his deposition, Dougan testified he did make ""an assumption"" there would be an ""incremental increase"" in referrals to 
Wesley between 25 and 30%. (Exh. 58, at 62). There is no evidence Wesley worked to pressure such results or to ""leverage"" 
them. "
1207,14," Plaintiffs attempt to dispute this fact, arguing that the doctors were only informed of their compensation information, but the 
evidence relied on (an affidavit from Perkins) is both inconsistent with his previously sworn testimony and with plaintiffs' 
argument, since it states that the physicians were also given productivity information. "
1210,15," The two experts reach markedly different conclusions as to what should be a fairly straightforward matter -- counting doctors. 
In many instances, the difference appears to be the product of the inclusion of medical student residents, new hires by the Clinic, 
or the departure of an independent group from Via Christi in 1997. In resolving the summary judgment motion, the court has 
taken into account the market figures most favorable to the plaintiffs. "
1214,16," In this context, the plaintiffs also cite a July 19, 1993 memo by Wesley President and CEO Blitz to Wick Lyne, President of 
HCA's Western Group Operations, which states: I recommend that we proceed with the exercising of the option [to buy the Clinic's building] with the condition or 
understanding that during the next 2-4 years we shall pursue to vertically integrate COLUMBIA/HCA Wesley Medical 
Center and the Wichita Clinic. This vertical integration would ultimately mean the purchase of the Wichita Clinic practice 
and its remaining assets. (Plf. Exh. 133). This proposal -- and there is no evidence the option to purchase the Wichita Clinic building was ever anything 
more than a proposal -- was advanced a year before the joint venture negotiations began, by an officer of Wesley who played no 
role in those negotiations. Indeed, the memo is from an officer of Wesley prior to the time it was purchased by Columbia, and 
has little relationship to what the principals may have intended nearly two years later. The fact remains that the plaintiffs have 
failed to demonstrate the joint venture negotiations were not conducted in good faith, or that any representations made by the 
defendants during that period were false at the time they were made. "
1216,17," The defendants deny any violation of the anti-kickback statute. To the extent there is evidence suggesting Wesley or 
Columbia/HCA expected additional referrals from directly employing physicians, the defendants stress the evidence does not 
suggest these expectations either included or targeted Medicaid or Medicare patient referrals. "
1217,18," Defendants contend that plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Joyce, erroneously applied Horizontal Merger Guidelines, relevant to a Section 7 
claim under the Clayton Act. There is authority for the principle that Section 7 actions (which involve proposed mergers) involve 
a different, higher standard of legality than actions under Section 2.  Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 318."
1217,19," The plaintiffs suggest Shoppin' Bag indicated that either price control or an ability to exclude competitors satisfies the 
dangerous probability of success element. This misreads the case. While the court recognized this was the argument of the 
appellant, 783 F.2d at 163, it then reviewed language from United States v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours, 351 U.S. 377, 391, 100 L. 
Ed. 1264, 76 S. Ct. 994 (1956) and United States v. Grinnell, 384 U.S. 563, 571, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778, 86 S. Ct. 1698 (1966) before 
concluding: In light of the du Pont holding, we believe that both elements have been necessary since the test's initial inception…. We hold, therefore, that monopoly power is correctly defined in this circuit as the ability to control prices and exclude 
competition."
1217,783, F.2d at 164 (emphasis in Shoppin' Bag). 
1218,20," United States Surgical Corp. v. Orris, Inc., Case No. 96-2300-GTV (D. Kan.) "
1222,21," See Manor of Burlingame, Inc. v. SHCC, Inc., 22 Kan. App. 2d 437, 916 P.2d 733 (1996); Gragg v. Rhoney, 20 Kan. App. 2d 
123, 884 P.2d 443 (1994); Harp v. Appliance Mart, Inc., 16 Kan. App. 2d 696, 827 P.2d 1209 (1992); Wichita Wire v. Lenox, 11 
Kan. App. 2d 459, 726 P.2d 287 (1986)."
1222,22," This provision of the Restatement provides: HN15[
] (1) One who intentionally causes a third person not to enter into a prospective contractual relation with another 
who is his competitor or not to continue an existing contract terminable at will does not interfere improperly with the other's 
relation if (a) the relation concerns a matter involved in the competition between the actor and the other and (b) the actor does not employ wrongful means and (c) his action does not create or continue an unlawful restraint of trade and (d) his purpose is at least in part to advance his interest in competing with the other. "
1223,," (2) The fact that one is a competitor of another for the business of a third person does not prevent his causing a breach of 
an existing contract with the other from being an improper interference if the contract is not terminable at will. "
1225,23," The court notes that there is some authority from Kansas which discusses similar noncompete provisions in the context of 
""alternative"" performance. Thus, in Weber v. Tillman, 259 Kan. 457, 913 P.2d 84 (1996), the court dealt with the validity of a 
provision limiting the ability of a physician to practice within a specified area. The agreement provided that the physician would 
not practice within 30 miles of his prior practice for two years, or ""alternatively, you may elect to practice in the aforementioned 
area upon payment of an amount equal to six months salary and bonus."" Id. at 459. The court noted the defendant could be 
liable for damages since he ""did not pay liquidated damages under the alternative provision of the restrictive covenant"" Id. at 460 
(emphasis added). This language suggests that in Kansas the actual language used -- ""liquidated damages"" versus ""alternative 
contract"" -- is not controlling. What would be controlling is the intent of the parties: whether they considered unauthorized competition to be a ""breach"" of the 
employment agreement. Here, there is some indication that they did not. This arises from the response of plaintiffs to prior 
competition by four cardiologists. The cardiologists had noncompete provisions in their employment contracts which, for present 
purposes, are the equivalent of the provisions in the physicians who left the Clinic to work for Wesley. Significantly, the Clinic did 
not sue the cardiologists for breach of the employment agreement due to the competition, but alleged breach for failing to pay 
the liquidated damages. In the present case, IHS was asked if it had made any demands against other persons for matters 
arising out of their employment agreements. Referencing the cardiologists' case, IHS responded that it was not necessary for 
IHS to become involved because ""the physicians … satisfied their contractual obligations to the Clinic"" by paying the specified 
damages. (Uncontr. Fact P 347; 348-50). The court finds that, given the absence of clear evidence as to the intent of the parties on the issue of alternative contracts, 
summary judgment on these grounds would be inappropriate. "
1226,24," In H&R Block, Inc. v. Lovelace, 208 Kan. 538, 544, 493 P.2d 205 (1972), approved as ""trenchantly stated"" the distinction 
drawn in Arthur Murray Dance Studios of Cleveland v. Witter, 62 Ohio L. Abs. 17, 105 N.E.2d 685 (Ohio Com. Pl. 1952) between 
attempts to enforce noncompetition agreements against former employees on the one hand, and against sellers of an 
established business on the other. A seller of an established business has more freedom in resisting the pressure to include 
such a clause in a contract of sale than an employee -- even a physician -- does in preventing the inclusion of such a provision in 
an employment contract. Thus, the Kansas court quoted with approval the statement in Arthur Murray that typically a 
noncompetition agreement between employer and employee is more critically examined, more strictly construed -- it is construed favorably to the employee -- it is viewed with askance 
and more jealously -- it is not viewed as liberally or with the same indulgence -- it is looked upon with less favor, more 
disfavor -- courts are more loathe, less disposed and more reluctant to sustain or enforce it…."

1235,8," Although PNI did publish one advertisement for Apartment Source of New Jersey in late June of 1997, it did so inadvertently. 
(Compl. at PP 51-52.)"
1235,9," In their Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendants focused exclusively, with the exception of one footnote, on an analysis of 
Plaintiffs' Section 2 claims based on the market for rental advertising. In their Opposition to Defendants' Motion, Plaintiffs made 
clear that they were abandoning this market theory and instead were proceeding solely on the ALS market theory. 
Consequently, Defendants' moving papers were largely rendered moot. For that reason, the Court has focused its attention on 
the arguments made by Defendants in their Reply and subsequent letter briefs and at the March 8, 1999 hearing on their Motion. 
Similarly, the Court has considered the arguments made by Plaintiffs in their Opposition and subsequent letter briefs and at the 
hearing. "
1236,10," As discussed more fully below, Plaintiffs maintain that PNI, as the parent corporation of its wholly-owned subsidiary, 
Apartment Solutions, is a competitor of Apartment Source in the ALS market. (Pls.' Opp. at 61 n. 17) "
1238,11," The Court notes that the Courts of Appeal for the Fourth and Ninth Circuits have recognized that under certain circumstances 
particular forms of advertising can constitute product markets that are distinct from other forms of advertising. High Technology 
Careers v. San Jose Mercury News, 996 F.2d 987, 990 (9th Cir. 1993); Ad-Vantage Telephone Directory Consultants, Inc. v. 
GTE Directories Corp., 849 F.2d 1336, 1341-42 (4th Cir. 1987). "
1240,12," Defendants' argument that the four-part essential facilities test, which was first announced in MCI Communications Corp. v. 
AT&T, ""ultimately is dictum"" and therefore can be modified by this Court is simply incorrect. (3/8/99 Hrg. Tr. at 22.) The four-part 
test set forth in Ideal Dairy Farms is the law in this Circuit. "
1241,13," Although in their Motion Defendants developed in detail their argument that there are no barriers to entering the market for 
rental advertising, their argument with respect to entry barriers in the context of the ALS market presented at the hearing on their 
Motion is sketchy at best. (3/8/99 Hrg. Tr. at 41-43.) Moreover, Plaintiffs contend, based on their Rule 56 submissions, that the 
denial of access to PNI's newspapers precludes entry into the ALS market. Under these circumstances, the Court will not grant 
summary judgment on this ground because of the existence of genuine issues of material fact."
1241,14," The Court is unpersuaded by Defendants' argument that allegations included in Plaintiffs' Complaint concerning alleged lost 
advertising revenues constitute admissions by Plaintiffs that establish, as a matter of law, a legitimate business justification for 
PNI's refusal to deal. First, the allegations referenced by Defendants were included in the Complaint to support Plaintiffs' 
abandoned theory concerning the existence of a market for rental advertising. As such, these allegations are now irrelevant. 
Second, the business justification given by PNI for its refusal to deal is not based on lost revenues, but rather is based on PNI's 
alleged policy of refusing advertising from competitors. "
1242,15," The Court, however, agrees with Defendants that certain of the Supreme Court's decisions in this area are anomalous. For 
example, in Aspen Skiing, a ski lift operator refused to continue in a joint marketing effort with its smaller competitor. The 
Supreme Court found a Section 2 violation where the competitors had a prior history of cooperation and the end of that 
cooperation would have a severe impact on competition in the relevant product market. The facts of Aspen Skiing are unique, 
and therefore the Court is not inclined to apply Aspen Skiing in a refusal to deal case such as this one where there is no history 
of cooperation between Apartment Source and Apartment Solutions. See Olympia Equipment Leasing Co. v. Western Union 
Telegraph Co., 797 F.2d 370, 379 (7th Cir. 1986) (""If [Aspen Skiing] stands for any principle that goes beyond its unusual facts, it 
is that a monopolist may be guilty of monopolization if it refuses to cooperate with a competitor in circumstances where some 
cooperation is indispensable to effective competition""). "
1247,*," Honorable Nathaniel R. Jones, Senior U.S. Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation. "
1248,1," The parties disagree as to how many shows were the object of this contract. In its brief, PIC names seven; MCA adds an 
eighth."
1248,2," These shows included List of a Lifetime, List of a Lifetime II, Magnum P.I., and 17 Miscellaneous Features. "
1249,3, The district court found against PIC on its breach of contract counterclaim. PIC does not appeal on this issue. 
1250,4," We do, of course, analyze the state law claims presented under the law of Florida, the state in which this suit arose."
1250,5,"  The case law in Florida is clear that a creditor may conduct itself in such a manner that it either waives its right to declare a 
contract in default or is estopped to do so without first giving the debtor notice of its intent to declare a default. When a 
creditor's conduct in habitually accepting late payments rises to the level of a waiver, then notice of intent to declare a 
default is ineffective to revoke such waiver and allow repossession; the creditor must pursue other remedies, such as a suit 
on the note. Walker, 484 So. 2d at 62-63 (citations omitted)."
1250,6," Philpot has been reaffirmed by the Florida courts on at least one occasion, see Eskridge v. Macklevy, 468 So. 2d 337, 339 (Fla. 
Dist. Ct. App. 1985), and cited with approval on at least one other. See Western World, Inc. v. Dansby, 603 So. 2d 597, 601 (Fla. 
Dist. Ct. App. 1992). "
1251,7," See MURRAY ON CONTRACTS § 125, at 710 (explaining that the determination as to whether damages are readily 
ascertainable at the time of breach is ""designed to corroborate the parties' assumed intention to honestly forecast damages in 
the event of a breach,"" since in cases where damages would be easily ascertainable at the time of breach, ""the need for such a 
clause evaporates and there is some suspicion that the clause was designed for purposes other than the legitimate purpose of 
honestly forecasting damages""). "
1253,8," That this is precisely the way this clause operates is clear from the actions taken by MCA during its negotiations with PIC 
during June of 1994. After negotiations broke down on June 24, MCA revoked PIC's licenses retroactively from June 1, and sued 
for copyright infringement on all broadcasts after June 1. Given that the parties were negotiating the performance of a contract, it 
is hard to see how the concept of ""retroactive infringement"" can have any meaning. PIC had through the contract purchased the 
rights to broadcast MCA's programs. The notion that MCA had the power retroactively to rescind the contract makes a mockery 
of that contractual agreement and would put any contracting party in PIC's position in terror of upsetting the licensor in any way 
for fear of being declared in breach, having the contracted-for licenses ""retroactively revoked,"" and being sued both for breach of 
contract and in copyright for statutory damages that can far outweigh contractually negotiated licensing fees. This is hardly the 
situation contemplated by contract doctrine, the point of which is to enable parties acting in good faith to arrange mutually 
beneficial agreements, and to anticipate from the start both the extent of their liability and fair dealing from their contractual 
counterpart. "
1254,9," As one Florida court explained, ""the election of remedies doctrine is an application of the doctrine of estoppel and operates on 
the theory that a party electing one course of action should not later be allowed to avail himself of an incompatible course. The 
purpose of the doctrine is to prevent a double recovery for the same wrong."" Barbe v. Villeneuve, 505 So. 2d 1331, 1332 (Fla. 
1987) (citations omitted)."
1254,10, This circumstance is therefore vastly different from that in which a pirate violates a copyright without the consent of the holder.
1254,11," See United States Naval Inst. v. Charter Communications, Inc., 936 F.2d 692, 695 (2d Cir. 1991) (""An exclusive licensee of 
any of the rights comprised in the copyright, though it is capable of breaching the contractual obligations imposed on it by the 
license, cannot be liable for infringing the copyright conveyed to it.""). "
1255,12," We do, however, note that were such efforts to be accompanied by an attempt to recover the full contract price in damages, 
they would, under Florida law at least, run afoul of the election of remedies doctrine. "
1256,13," In Paramount, the Supreme Court found the practice of block booking to constitute an abuse of the protections of the 
Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 1. As the Court explained, The sole interest of the United States and the primary object in conferring the [copyright] monopoly lie in the general 
benefits derived by the public from the labors of authors. It is said that reward to the author or artist serves to induce 
release to the public of the products of his creative genius. But the reward does not serve its public purpose if it is not 
related to the quality of the copyright. Where a high quality film greatly desired is licensed only if an inferior one is taken, the 
latter borrows quality from the former and strengthens its monopoly by drawing on the other. The practice tends to equalize 
rather than differentiate the reward for the individual copyrights. Even where all the films included in the package are of 
equal quality, the requirements that all be taken if one is desired increases the market for some. Each stands not on its own 
footing but in whole or in part on the appeal which another film may have. . . . The result is to add to the monopoly of the 
copyright in violation of the principle of the patent cases involving tying clauses. Paramount, 334 U.S. at 158 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoted in full in Loew's, 371 U.S. at 46-47)."
1256,14," The term ""vertical maximum price fixing"" refers to agreements under which manufacturers or suppliers set the maximum 
resale prices to be charged by their distributors. See Senate Oil, 118 S. Ct. at 279. "
1257,15," Our own Circuit's precedent, although reflecting a similar reluctance to invoke the per se standard, has also continued to 
recognize that per se rules are appropriate under certain carefully drawn circumstances. See, e.g., Southern Card & Novelty, 
Inc. v. Lawson Mardon Label, Inc., 138 F.3d 869, 875 (11th Cir. 1998) (recognizing that, although ""most antitrust claims are 
analyzed under a 'rule of reason,' . . . 'certain tying arrangements pose an unacceptable risk of stifling competition and therefore 
are unreasonable per se'"") (quoting Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 9, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 
1551 (1984)); All Care Nursing Serv., Inc. v. High Tech Staffing Serv., Inc., 135 F.3d 740, 746 (11th Cir. 1998) (""Some acts have 
been said to be so facially anticompetitive that by their very nature they are deemed unreasonable and, thus, per se violative of 
antitrust laws.""). As we explained in All Care Nursing, the decision to apply the per se standard [instead of the rule of reason] turns on 'whether the practice facially appears to be 
one that would always or almost always tend to restrict competition and decrease output . . . or instead one designed to 
'increase economic efficiency and render markets more, rather than less, competitive.' Id. at 746 (quoting Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery and Printing Co., 472 U.S. 284, 289-90, 86 L. Ed. 
2d 202, 105 S. Ct. 2613 (1985) (brackets and ellipsis in original)). "
1258,16," MCA also argues that ""block booking only arises where the licensee is forced to acquire the unwanted programs in order to 
obtain the desirable programs"" and that because none of the Harry episodes had previously been aired, it was impossible to 
determine the desirability of the episodes at the time the agreement was formalized. This argument entirely disregards the 
district court's explicit factual finding that PIC ""was coerced into purchasing Harry and the Hendersons, which [PIC] either did not 
want at all or would have preferred to purchase strictly on a barter basis. . . ."""
1258,17," See Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 117 S. Ct. 1997, 2017, 138 L. Ed. 2d 391 (1997) (""'If a precedent of this Court has direct 
application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow 
the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.'"") (quoting Rodriguez de 
Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484, 104 L. Ed. 2d 526, 109 S. Ct. 1917 (1989))."
1258,18," MCA offers this Circuit's recent decision in Southern Card & Novelty, Inc. v. Lawson Mardon Label, Inc., 138 F.3d 869 (11th 
Cir. 1998) as support for its argument that the Harry contract would not be found invalid under the rule of reason standard. 
Because the appropriate standard for evaluating the legality of the arrangement at issue here is the per se standard, we find 
Southern Card to be inapposite. "
1259,19," The district court was, of course, right not to enforce the cash portion of the Harry contract. HN15[
] ""Where a statute 
expressly or by implication prohibits the making of a certain kind of contract, it is clear that any agreement in violation of that 
statute is unenforceable."" MURRAY ON CONTRACTS § 98, at 528. It erred, however, in treating the contract as a nullity. The 
terms of the contract violated the antitrust laws. If PIC suffered antitrust injury thereby, the fact that the contract was not 
ultimately enforced by the courts does not negate that injury for purposes of the Clayton Act."
1259,20," The parties dispute whether sufficient discovery was taken on the question of antitrust injury. We leave it to the discretion of 
the district court whether to rely on the extant record to reach its disposition on this question, or whether to reopen discovery to 
allow PIC further opportunity to make its case."
1259,21," The district court, finding no antitrust injury, rightly concluded that such a finding will not support an award of attorney's fees 
under the statute. See 15 U.S.C. § 15(a) (codifying § 4 of the Clayton Act providing that in addition to treble damages, any party 
suffering injury ""by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws . . . shall recover . . . the cost of suit, including a reasonable 
attorney's fee""). We note, however, as this Circuit has explicitly found, that ""HN16[
] nowhere in Section 4 of the Clayton Act is 
a minimal injury requirement mentioned"" and that ""accordingly, . . . the dollar amount of the injury alleged is not relevant to the 
grant of attorney's fees."" Amey, Inc. v. Gulf Abstract & Title, Inc., 758 F.2d 1486, 1509 (11th Cir. 1985); see also Sciambra v. 
Graham News, 892 F.2d 411, 416 (5th Cir. 1990) (finding that ""the structure of section 4 [of the Clayton Act] and the fact of 
damage analysis make the actual recovery of compensatory damages irrelevant to the recoverability of attorneys' fees""). Thus if, 
on remand, PIC is able to demonstrate that it suffered actual injury in any amount as a consequence of having agreed to the 
cash portion of the Harry contract, PIC will also be entitled to recover attorney's fees on this claim. "
1264,*," The Honorable Todd J. Campbell, United States District Judge for the Middle District of Tennessee, sitting by designation. "
1294,1," While this category is the most ominous sounding, it was functionally identical to the specification effort. In both instances, FMC 
attempted to get certain features it possessed and Stearns did not--such as electromechanical design, certification from an 
outside body, or a direct legal responsibility for the product--incorporated in the specifications. "
1295,2," Stearns attempts to distinguish Superturf and Triple M because these contracts had an ""or equal"" clause. This is a distinction 
without a difference. In these cases, the specifications were for a specific brand. The result of such a specification and the 
addition of an ""or equal"" clause is essentially the same as that generated by the general specification here. A contract might say 
""FMC Bridge or equal"" or it might say ""electromechanical bridge."" In either case, FMC would meet the specification but Stearns 
could also qualify by demonstrating it could produce an electromechanical bridge equal to FMC's."
1295,3," Stearns relies heavily on a case in this Circuit without recognizing that it was properly vacated pursuant to a settlement 
agreement and thus carries no precedential weight.  Great Western Directories v. Southwestern Bell Telephone, 63 F.3d 1378, 
1386 (5th Cir. 1995), modified, 74 F.3d 613, vacated pursuant to settlement agreement (August 21, 1996), cert dismissed, 117 
S. Ct. 26 (August 27, 1996). However, Great Western also involved conduct that harmed the monopolist and could only be 
understood when one recognized that competitors suffered more severe harm. In Great Western the defendant asked an 
affiliated supplier to raise prices across the board, raising defendant's costs but inflicting more pain on its cash-starved "
1296,," competitor. Id. at 1386 (quoting expert economic testimony that such behavior was irrational except as an attempt to cripple 
competitors)."
1296,4," Stearns continually refers back to FMC documents which indicate that FMC was aware that a certain specification would 
prevent Stearns from bidding, and was pleased by this fact. Writing a memo saying that you are winning a competition on the 
merits does not change the fact that it is a competition on the merits. If Stearns reached the bidding stage, calculated its bid, and 
believed that it could maintain an adequate margin at a price FMC could not match, it would not violate section 2 by expressing 
its satisfaction with the expected result."
1296,5," Apparently, a handful of negotiations between FMC and municipalities may have led to technical violations of the relevant 
public contracting statutes. Stearns was either silent or half-hearted in complaining to the relevant authorities when these 
violations occurred. It now attempts to claim that violation of these municipal bidding statutes constitutes a per se antitrust 
violation. But a major purpose of these state statutes is protection of the municipal taxpayer from corruption--which we have no 
evidence of (there is nothing to indicate that in any of these instances the municipal authorities were acting in other than what 
they thought was best for the municipality in respect to the particular purchase being made). The Sherman Act, in contrast, "
1297,," protects the consumer from anticompetitive forces. We decline Stearn's invitation. ""Even a direct contract for the Guilbert 
system, without any pretense of putting the job out for bid (and thus a clear violation of the competitive bid statute), would not in 
itself have constituted a restraint of trade under the Sherman Act if the selection of Guilbert had been made in an atmosphere 
free from anticompetitive restraints."" Security Fire Door, 484 F.2d at 1031."
1297,6," Stearns fails to articulate how under its theory of the case a municipality could ever make a decision to favor quality over price 
when the higher quality producer has a strong market share. The logic of Stearns' argument would not only make it impossible 
for an informed municipal consumer to pick FMC's smart bridge over Stearns' cheaper bridge, it would also bar a consumer from 
purchasing aircraft boarding bridges in the first place. Stearns' expert noted that other methods of boarding passengers on 
airplanes exist--notably stairs--but bridges are ""so superior to these other methods that it has largely displaced them."" This 
superiority is reflected in the specifications that airports now draw up--all of the contracts at issue specified bridges. Thus even if 
a stair assembly was cheaper, its manufacturer has been excluded from the final bidding process. But no one would argue that a 
municipality is forbidden from making this choice, even if Stearns and FMC collectively have a lock on the passenger boarding 
device market. Nor could it credibly be maintained--without evidence that the bridge manufacturers had corrupted the judgment 
of the consumer's agents--that this exclusion was not on the merits."
1297,7," But Stearns complains just as vociferously about FMC's attempts to include quality as a weighting factor in determining bids--
when it clearly could compete, albeit with some recognition of the difference in technologies--as it does about bids in which it 
was barred by a particular specification. And it should be noted that nothing is stopping Stearns from developing smart-bridges 
and electromechanical technologies that would match the specifications it complains of. While the record indicates that the time 
and cost involved in retooling make this impractical in regards to a particular bid after its specifications have been announced, in 
terms of future bids we have no evidence to sustain a finding that Stearns could not begin this process tomorrow and thus 
expand its ability to compete on such projects. "
1298,8," And, at oral argument it was asserted that the ""inducement"" had inevitably led to the officers ending up ""in cahoots."" "
1299,9," Stearns attempts to avoid the application of this standard by claiming that here, unlike in Matsushita and Brooke Group, a 
single defendant with overwhelming market share is involved. While the Court noted that the multi-party nature of the claimed 
predatory pricing conspiracies (between Japanese electronics manufacturers and large tobacco companies, respectively) 
increased the irrationality of the claimed conduct, on both occasions the Court indicated that the reasoning of the opinions 
applies to claims against a single firm. See Brooke Group, 113 S. Ct. at 2590 (schemes are ""even more improbable"" when 
multiple firms involved); Matsushita, 106 S. Ct. at 1357 (""These observations apply even to predatory pricing by a single firm 
seeking monopoly power.""). The basic insight of these cases--that predation as a strategy is so unlikely to reap rewards that it 
should not be inferred easily, and that such an inference should be especially shunned since it is so hard to disentangle from the 
type of vigorous price competition that the antitrust laws seek to promote--is not altered when only one defendant is involved. 
See American Academic Suppliers v. Beckley-Cardy, Inc., 922 F.2d 1317, 1319-21 (7th Cir. 1991) (affirming summary judgment 
for single defendant on section 1 predatory pricing claims by noting lack of evidence that defendant could have hoped to recoup 
losses incurred during alleged scheme). The size of defendant's market share may of course be relevant in determining the ease 
with which he may drive out a competitor through his scheme--but it does not, standing alone, allow a presumption that this can 
occur. Nor does market share tell us anything about the problem of new entrants preventing the sustained charging of supra-
competitive prices necessary for recoupment. "
1302,10," ""If transportation costs were the only problem, firms from overseas could set up manufacturing facilities here in North 
America."""
1302,11," Richard Pell, a former employee of FMC whose testimony is critical for all of Stearns' predatory pricing claims, was quite 
emphatic that FMC could not rely on barriers to entry to protect it from competition. ""There will always be a competitor to Jetway. 
There may be short periods when there aren't; but if they manage to put Stearns out of business, for example, within two years, 
there will be another bridge manufacturer competing with Jetway."""
1302,12," Summary judgment is appropriate when an ill-reasoned expert opinion suggests the court adopt an irrational inference, or 
rests on an error of fact or law. See Matsushita, 106 S. Ct. at 1360 n.19 (expert opinion on predation has little probative value in 
light of economic factors that indicate expert's scenario is irrational); Bell, 847 F.2d at 1184 (affirming decision of district court on 
the question of market power, since expert imprecisely defined the market, which led to a legal error in his conclusion). Here, 
Stearns' expert rested his conclusion on an error of law--he assumed FMC's efforts to sell its products violated section 2 of the 
Sherman Act."
1302,13," Stearns places great reliance on its claim that when Stearns does not bid on a project, FMC's bids are significantly higher. It 
directs the court in particular to two instances involving very small projects in which FMC came to the bid armed with two 
proposals. When Stearns failed to bid, it used its higher bid and pocketed the other proposal. Insofar as we are asked to infer 
from this that the lower, unused bid was predatory, we note that there is no evidence showing the unused bid was below cost. If 
these isolated episodes are relied on to show FMC's intent and ability to charge supracompetitive prices, we note that the 
antitrust laws cannot protect consumers from the inadequacies of a competitor. A new entrant to the market may not be as 
cavalier about letting business opportunities pass as Stearns was in these instances. Of course, documentation of these "
1303,," incidents would seem to provide Stearns an excellent--albeit apparently unused--tool to persuade municipalities that 
overreliance on FMC is not in their best interest."
1303,14," It must be noted that the expert relied on an erroneous interpretation of the law regarding predatory pricing. The opinion 
clearly indicated that the expert believed the law of this Circuit allowed a finding of predation when prices are above a firm's 
variable costs but below a ""short-run profit maximizing price."" As we explained above, this position is no longer tenable in the 
wake of Brooke Group. This error may explain, but does not excuse, the expert's failure to address the question of variable cost. 
In affirming summary judgment, we may disregard the conclusions of an expert opinion grounded in an error of law. See Bell, 
847 F.2d at 1184. "
1304,15," A threshold problem with this allegation is that even if part C was bid below-cost, Stearns has not alleged that the project as a 
whole was unprofitable. In an analogous case, we rejected an argument that price cuts in the original equipment market could be 
examined in isolation when the evidence indicated that the replacement market and original equipment market were inseparable.  
Stitt Spark Plug Co. v. Champion Spark Plug Co., 840 F.2d 1253, 1256 (5th Cir.1988) (""Any meaningful comparison of price and 
cost must encompass Champion's sales to both markets. Stitt's evidence did not demonstrate that Champion's practices were 
'predatory' across both markets.""). Here, the fact that FMC may have chosen for internal reasons or salesmanship purposes to 
shift costs in this manner is not objectionable without a showing that the project as a whole was not priced above its variable 
cost. When a company has a ""buy one, get one free"" promotion, it would be incorrect to look at the nominal price of the ""free"" 
product--zero--and infer predation from this fact."
1304,16," Even if we were to simply disregard FMC's affidavit, there is nothing inherent in the term ""general and administrative"" that 
automatically allows an inference that this category was a variable cost. Administrative costs may involve the work of salaried 
workers not subject to overtime--which over the short term is a fixed cost. And as a catch-all category G&A would seem a natural 
place to allocate a percentage of long term fixed costs--like rent and the salary of the CEO--for internal accounting purposes. "

1314,2," The Legislature has given section 17200 et seq. no official name. Accordingly, we are now using the label ""unfair competition 
law."" ( Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. v. Lucky Stores, Inc. (1998) 17 Cal. 4th 553, 558, fn. 2 [71 Cal. Rptr. 2d 731, 950 P.2d 1086].) "
1315,3," The situation may have changed somewhat in the meantime. ""Competition in the cellular service market, which now consists of 
two regulated facilities-based carriers in each cellular market, will be expanded in many areas with the entry of an unregulated 
system . . . ."" (Re Regulation of Cellular Radiotelephone Utilities (1995) 59 Cal.P.U.C.2d 192, 203.) This opinion concerns only 
the facts reflected in the record and not possible recent developments. "
1316,4," In its amicus curiae brief, the PUC did express one ""caveat"": that a judicial decision prohibiting bundling would interfere with its 
jurisdiction. We need not decide this point, for the question of bundling is not before us. Like the Court of Appeal, we express no 
opinion regarding bundling. "
1317,5," The Model Penal Code itself resolves the ambiguity by defining "" 'intentionally' or 'with intent' "" as meaning ""purposely."" (Model 
Pen. Code, § 1.13(12).) Some of the states that have adopted that code's distinction between purpose and knowledge have 
used the word ""intentionally"" instead of ""purposely"" but have defined it to mean ""conscious objective."" (Model Pen. Code & 
Commentaries, com. 2 to § 2.02, p. 235, fn. 11.) "
1319,6," As originally enacted in 1941, section 17044 provided, ""The practice of using any article or product as a 'loss leader' is included 
among the prohibitions of this chapter."" (Stats. 1941, ch. 526, § 1, p. 1842.) The section was amended in 1953 to read as it now 
does. (Stats. 1953, ch. 334, § 1, p. 1601.) Section 17030 was enacted in 1941 with section 17044 and has not been amended 
since. (Stats. 1941, ch. 526, § 1, p. 1841.) "
1321,7," Justice Baxter would essentially read the word ""purpose"" out of section 17043 and subject L.A. Cellular to potential treble 
damages, attorney fees, and even criminal sanctions for nonpurposeful conduct despite the statutory language. We decline to do 
so."
1321,8," In its entirety, section 17200 provides: HN7[
] ""As used in this chapter, unfair competition shall mean and include any 
unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising and any act 
prohibited by Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 17500) of Part 3 of Division 7 of the Business and Professions Code [which 
involves advertising]."" "
1322,9," Apparently taking her cue from the brief of amicus curiae American Council of Life Insurance, Justice Kennard asserts the 
unfair competition law did nothing more than codify the common law. (Conc. & dis. opn. of Kennard, J., post, at p. 194.) (Even 
L.A. Cellular does not make such a sweeping argument.) She relies primarily on International etc. Workers v. Landowitz (1942) 
20 Cal. 2d 418 [126 P.2d 609]. (Conc. & dis. opn. of Kennard, J., post, at pp. 194, 196, 197, 200.) That decision does, indeed, 
contain some language supporting her position. However, in Barquis v. Merchants Collection Assn., supra, 7 Cal. 3d at page 
109, we unanimously concluded ""that 'unfair competition' as used in the section cannot be equated with the common law 
definition of 'unfair competition,' but instead specifies that, for the purposes of its provisions, unfair competition 'shall mean and 
include unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business practice . . . .' (Italics added.)"" Regarding the language Justice Kennard cites, we 
stated, ""Although the Landowitz opinion does contain some language which may be read to limit [Civil Code former] section 
3369 [the original unfair competition law] to common law 'unfair competition,' subsequent cases . . . have not confined the 
section so narrowly; in view of the factual context of Landowitz, such language was not crucial to the decision."" ( Id. at pp. 111-
112, fn. 12; see also Rubin v. Green, supra, 4 Cal. 4th at p. 1200 [""to state a claim under the act one need not plead and prove 
the elements of a tort""]; Bank of the West v. Superior Court, supra, 2 Cal. 4th at p. 1264 [""the statutory definition of 'unfair 
competition' 'cannot be equated with the common law definition . . . .' ""]; Motors, Inc. v. Times Mirror Co., supra, 102 Cal. App. 
3d 735 [discussed in the text].) A year after the decision in People ex rel.  Mosk v. National Research Co. of Cal., supra, 210 Cal. App. 2d 765, again about 
three months after the decision in Barquis v. Merchants Collection Assn., supra, 7 Cal. 3d 94, and on occasion since, the 
Legislature amended the unfair competition law. On these occasions, rather than overrule these cases or Motors, Inc. v. Times 
Mirror Co., supra, 102 Cal. App. 3d 735, the Legislature expanded the law's coverage. (Stats. 1963, ch. 1606, § 1, p. 3184; 
Stats. 1972, ch. 1084, § 1, pp. 2020-2021; see Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. v. Lucky Stores, Inc., supra, 17 Cal. 4th at pp. 569-
570.) "
1324,10," L.A. Cellular also relies on Perdue v. Crocker National Bank (1985) 38 Cal. 3d 913 [216 Cal. Rptr. 345, 702 P.2d 503] and 
Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal. 3d 311 [216 Cal. Rptr. 718, 703 P.2d 58]. Those cases have no bearing on this issue. We held in 
each that the plaintiff's allegations--entirely different from the allegations here--did not state a cause of action under the unfair 
competition law or some other law. In neither case did we suggest an action under the unfair competition law is precluded 
merely because some other statute does not provide for that action. "
1325,11," Section 5 contains two prohibitions: one against ""unfair methods of competition"" and the other against ""unfair or deceptive acts 
or practices."" The former generally governs injuries to competitors, the latter injuries to consumers as well as competitors. ( 
Barquis v. Merchants Collection Assn., supra, 7 Cal. 3d at pp. 109-110.) Our notice of federal law under section 5 means only 
that federal cases interpreting the prohibition against ""unfair methods of competition"" may assist us in determining whether a 
particular challenged act or practice is unfair under the test we adopt. We do not deem the federal cases controlling or 
determinative, merely persuasive."
1325,12," This case involves an action by a competitor alleging anticompetitive practices. Our discussion and this test are limited to that 
context. Nothing we say relates to actions by consumers or by competitors alleging other kinds of violations of the unfair 
competition law such as ""fraudulent"" or ""unlawful"" business practices or ""unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising."" We 
also express no view on the application of federal cases such as FTC v. Sperry & Hutchinson Co. (1972) 405 U.S. 233 [92 S. Ct. 
898, 31 L. Ed. 2d 170] that involve injury to consumers and therefore do not relate to actions like this one. Contrary to Justice Kennard's concurring and dissenting opinion, this test is not unduly uncertain. A body of law interpreting 
section 5 already exists. (See, e.g., Averitt, The Meaning of ""Unfair Methods of Competition"" in Section 5 of the Federal Trade 
Commission Act (1980) 21 B.C. L.Rev. 227.) "
1327,13," Justices Kennard and Baxter have differing interpretations of the facts. The trial court concluded that, because L.A. Cellular 
did not violate the Unfair Practices Act, it did not violate the unfair competition law; therefore, it never considered the facts in light 
of the test we have stated. We think it best for the trial court to do so on remand in the first instance. We also express no opinion 
on the correct remedy should the trial court find L.A. Cellular violated the unfair competition law. "
1328,*," Associate Justice of the Court of Appeal, Fifth District, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the 
California Constitution. "
1329,1," In the prestatutory period, the one use of the term ""unfair competition"" in the common law that developed outside the area of 
consumer deception was trade secret misappropriation. ( Scavengers' P. Assn. v. Serv-U-Garbage Co. (1933) 218 Cal. 568 [24 
P.2d 489]; Pasadena Ice Co. v. Reeder (1929) 206 Cal. 697, 703 [275 P. 944, 276 P. 995]; New Method Laundry Co. v. 
MacCann (1916) 174 Cal. 26, 30 [161 P. 990].) Economically, however, there is a strong similarity between the deceptive 
misappropriation of a trade name and the form of trade secret misappropriation most common in this court's cases of that period, 
namely, use of a competitor's customer lists. This becomes apparent when one considers that for a transaction to occur it is not 
enough for a business to offer a desirable product at a competitive price. Every business also faces the problem, and expense, 
of searching out customers to inform them of its product and to persuade them to purchase it. In a trade name misappropriation 
case, the plaintiff has done so by incurring the cost of establishing a valuable trade name that serves as an efficient vehicle for 
disseminating information about its product to its customers. In a customer list misappropriation case, the plaintiff has done so 
by identifying individual customers and their needs, incurring the cost of acquiring that information. In both trade name and 
customer list misappropriation cases, the defendant is able to reduce its search costs incurred in obtaining new customers by 
free-riding on the investments of the plaintiff in searching out customers. It may have been an intuitive recognition of this 
similarity that led courts of the prestatutory period to extend the rubric of unfair competition to trade secret misappropriation. "
1331,2," In looking to section 5 of the FTC Act, the majority may have been misled by this court's previous statement that the unfair 
competition law had ""its origin as one of the so-called 'little FTC Acts' of the 1930's, enacted by many states in the wake of 
amendments to the Federal Trade Commission Act [i.e., the Wheeler-Lea Act of 1938, 52 Statutes at Large 111, which added 
the phrase 'unfair or deceptive acts or practices' to the 'unfair methods of competition' prohibited by section 5 of the FTC Act] 
enlarging the commission's regulatory jurisdiction to include unfair business practices that harmed, not merely the interests of 
business competitors, but of the general public as well."" ( Rubin v. Green (1993) 4 Cal. 4th 1187, 1200 [17 Cal. Rptr. 2d 828, 
847 P.2d 1044].) Contrary to the assertion in Rubin v. Green, supra, 4 Cal. 4th 1187, 1200, there were no "" 'little FTC Acts' of the 1930's."" The 
term ""little FTC Act"" instead denotes a group of state statutes enacted in the 1960's and 1970's; these statutes, promoted by the 
FTC among others, were meant to complement the deceptive practices jurisdiction of the FTC, not its antitrust jurisdiction, and 
they address deceptive trade practices, not antitrust threats to competition. (See, e.g., Karns, State Regulation of Deceptive 
Trade Practices Under ""Little FTC Acts"": Should Federal Standards Control? (1990) 94 Dick. L.Rev. 373, 373-376; Bailey & 
Pertschuk, The Law of Deception: The Past as Prologue (1984) 33 Am. U. L.Rev. 849, 861 fn. 63 [authored by two FTC 
commissioners]; Comment, Consumer Protection: The Practical Effectiveness of State Deceptive Trade Practices Legislation "
1332,," (1984) 59 Tul. L.Rev. 427, 428; Note, Toward Greater Equality in Business Transactions: A Proposal to Extend the Little FTC 
Acts to Small Businesses (1983) 96 Harv. L.Rev. 1621, 1621-1624; Lovett, State Deceptive Trade Practice Legislation (1972) 46 
Tul. L.Rev. 724, 730, fn. 14.) California has such a ""little FTC Act"" incorporating verbatim the language of section 5 of the FTC Act, but it is not Business and 
Professions Code section 17200 et seq., the unfair competition law, and it does not prohibit penumbral antitrust threats. Rather, 
it is Civil Code sections 1750- 1784, the Consumers Legal Remedies Act, which was enacted in 1970. The act lists certain 
prohibited ""unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices"" (the language of section 5 of the FTC Act), 
beginning with ""passing off,"" and it provides various remedies to injured consumers. ( Civ. Code, § 1770; see also Reed, 
Legislating for the Consumer: An Insider's Analysis of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (1971) 2 Pacific L.J. 1.) In addition to misunderstanding the term ""little FTC Act,"" Rubin v. Green, supra, 4 Cal. 4th 1187, 1200, mixes up its chronology; 
because section 3369 was enacted in 1933, five years before the 1938 amendment expanding the FTC's jurisdiction, it obviously 
was not enacted in the ""wake"" of that amendment. The sole authority Rubin cites on this point, Bank of the West v. Superior 
Court, supra, 2 Cal. 4th 1254, 1264, is equally confused: ""A host of so-called 'little FTC Acts' followed [the 1938 amendment of 
the FTC Act] including California's Unfair Business Practices Act. (§ 17200 et seq.; see also Civ. Code, former § 3369.)"" It is 
worth noting that in each of these cases the question of the historical origins of the unfair competition law was not at issue and 
was not dispositive of any issue. Each decision discussed the point only in passing by way of background."
1332,3," The majority also misunderstands the significance of Barquis's statement that ""section 3369 indicates that 'unfair competition' 
as used in the section cannot be equated with the common law definition of 'unfair competition,' but instead specifies that, for the 
purposes of its provisions, unfair competition 'shall mean and include unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business practice . . . .' "" ( 
Barquis v. Merchants Collection Assn., supra, 7 Cal. 3d at p. 109, italics original; see maj. opn., ante, at p. 181, fn. 9.) Our point 
was that the unfair competition law expanded beyond the limits of common law unfair competition along two dimensions: First, 
because the unfair competition law provided relief for injury to consumers even absent any showing of injury to a competitor, it 
""extended to the entire consuming public the protection once afforded only to business competitors."" ( Barquis v. Merchants 
Collection Assn., supra, 7 Cal. 3d at p. 109; see also id. at p. 110 [""the courts, in interpreting the section, have long declared that 
the provision is at least as equally directed toward 'the right of the public to protection from fraud and deceit[,]' as toward the 
preservation of fair business competition"" (italics original)].) Second, because the unfair competition law included unlawful as 
well as unfair business practices, it prohibited a broader range of conduct than did common law unfair competition. ( Id. at pp. 
112-113.) Specifically, the unfair competition law prohibited not only the deceptive conduct that was an ""unfair . . . business 
practice"" but also, as an ""unlawful . . . business practice,"" "" 'anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at 
the same time is forbidden by law.' "" ( Id. at p. 113.) Nothing in Barquis suggested, however, that the term ""unfair . . . business 
practice"" meant penumbral antitrust threats, or that it did not mean deceptive conduct. "
1336,4," I note that the FTC has taken no reported action anywhere in the United States to oppose the below-cost distribution of cellular 
telephones by cellular service providers. Apparently, unlike the majority, it sees no significant threat to competition from this 
widespread practice. "
1337,1, All statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code unless otherwise indicated. 
1338,2," ""Cost"" IS DEFINED IN SECTION 17026: "" 'Cost' as applied to production includes the cost of raw materials, labor and all 
overhead expenses of the producer. "" 'Cost' as applied to distribution means the invoice or replacement cost, whichever is lower, of the article or product to the 
distributor and vendor, plus the cost of doing business by the distributor and vendor and in the absence of proof of cost of doing 
business a markup of 6 percent on such invoice or replacement cost shall be prima facie proof of such cost of doing business. "" 'Cost' as applied to warranty service agreements includes the cost of parts, transporting the parts, labor, and all overhead 
expenses of the service agency. ""Discounts granted for cash payments shall not be used to reduce costs."" Section 17029 provides, in turn: "" 'Cost of doing business' or 'overhead expense' means all costs of doing business incurred in 
the conduct of the business and shall include without limitation the following items of expense: labor (including salaries of 
executives and officers), rent, interest on borrowed capital, depreciation, selling cost, maintenance of equipment, delivery costs, 
credit losses, all types of licenses, taxes, insurance and advertising."" Finally, section 17073 provides: ""Proof of average overall cost of doing business for any particular inventory period when added 
to the cost of production of each article or product, as to a producer, or invoice or replacement cost, whichever is lower, of each 
article or product, as to a distributor, is presumptive evidence of cost of each such article or product involved in any action 
brought under this chapter."""
1338,3," Evidence Code section 776, subdivision (a): ""A party to the record of any civil action, or a person identified with such a party, 
may be called and examined as if under cross-examination by any adverse party at any time during the presentation of evidence 
by the party calling the witness."" "
1341,4," Section 17071.5 creates a similar presumption when a retailer's limitation of quantity and sale of the item below invoice or 
replacement cost is established. "
1342,5," Tri-Q, Inc. v. Sta-Hi Corp. (1965) 63 Cal. 2d 199 [45 Cal. Rptr. 878, 404 P.2d 486], is not authority for such an exception to the 
limited circumstances in which section 17050 authorizes below-cost sales. There, under pre-1985 procedures, a single appeal in 
consolidated cases was before this court on grant of hearing. The discussion of the section 17071 presumption there was in the 
portion of the vacated Court of Appeal opinion which addressed a UPA cause of action. This court adopted that part of the 
opinion because neither of the parties raised any issue as to its adequacy in the petition for hearing.  (63 Cal. 2d at p. 203.) The 
first issue addressed was whether the defendant corporation had sold its product below cost. The trial court found and the Court 
of Appeal agreed that the evidence supported its finding that under applicable accounting practices the product was not sold 
below cost. Moreover, the corporation did not intend to sell below cost. In that context the opinion states: ""That evidence was 
sufficient to render the presumption embodied in section 17071 of the Business and Professions Code of little evidentiary value. 
Consequently, it does not appear to be probable that a result more favorable to the plaintiff Tri-Q, Inc., would have been reached 
by the trial court even if it had found that such prices were less than the actual cost of the product."" ( Id. at p. 209.) "
1343,," That dictum in Tri-Q, Inc. v. Sta-Hi Corp., supra, 63 Cal. 2d 199, 209, at best stands for the proposition that a good faith belief 
that a product is not being sold below cost is a defense to a section 17043 action."
1343,6," Under section 17026, 6 percent is prima facie proof of the cost of doing business which must be added to the invoice or 
replacement cost of an item in establishing whether a product is sold below cost. "
1344,7," Before it initiated a general practice of below-cost equipment sales in conjunction with sales of cellular service, L.A. Cellular 
sold equipment below cost at its ""super store"" in West Los Angeles when asked by a customer to meet the price of another retail 
seller with an adjacent business because that seller was offering lower prices. When it did so, it had the customer execute a 
document in which the customer stated that the customer was making the certificate to induce L.A. Cellular to sell the equipment 
at a price competitive with a named competitor pursuant to section 17050, subdivision (d) and that the customer had no reason 
to believe that the competitor's price was not a lawful price."
1344,8," Title 15 United States Code section 13a (the Robinson-Patman Act) prohibits, inter alia, selling ""goods at unreasonably low 
prices for the purpose of destroying competition or eliminating a competitor."" "
1345,9," The concept of intent to injure has decreased in importance over the past 20 years. (See McCall, Private Enforcement of 
Predatory Price Laws Under the California Unlawful Practices Act and the Federal Antitrust Acts (1997) 28 Pacific L.J. 311, 331.) "

1350,4," The antitrust laws were designed for the protection of the public. Under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, as interpreted by the 
Supreme Court, agreements which unreasonably restrain trade are illegal. See, e.g., Standard Oil v. United States, 221 U.S. 1, 
55 L. Ed. 619, 31 S. Ct. 502 (1911). To make out a Section 1 violation, plaintiffs must prove: (1) a contract, combination or

exceptions to the antitrust laws are narrowly construed, as they circumvent Congress's commitment to open competition)."
1351,9," The NFL attaches great significance to the fact that the satellite broadcasts utilize the same images as the sponsored telecasts, 
fed from the same network television cameras. The use of the same signal for broadcast over two media, however, does not 
render the rights in one broadcast derivative of rights in the other. One could just as readily conclude that the network television 
broadcast rights are derivative, and constitute part of the NFL's rights in the non-sponsored satellite broadcast. The network's 
provision of cameras and commentary does not remove the arbitrariness of calling one broadcast derivative of the other. 
Exemption from the antitrust laws cannot be predicated on the simple expedient of assigning ownership of cameras or payment 
of camera crews and commentators to a television network. Rather, it is predicated on the ""sponsored telecast"" of the image, 
i.e., its transmission in a form freely receivable by the public."
1351,10," See id. (""Were the rule otherwise, the NFL could circumvent the statutory confines, nullify the statutory scheme, simply by

programming is not within the ""sponsored telecasting"" exemption). The NFL argues on appeal that references in the House records to sales to networks and ""other potential purchasers"" of 
television rights conflicts with a finding that the exemption was not intended to extend to broadcasts requiring payment by 
viewers. This is not so. In the context of the 1961 Act, the ""other potential purchasers"" were quite probably other sponsored (but 
non-network) purchasers, such as local and regional television stations."

1355,*," Of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting by designation. "
1356,1," In 1993, before the first trial, we affirmed the district court's denial of a preliminary injunction requiring CAPECO to end its price 
discrimination against Coastal. See Coastal Fuels of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Caribbean Petroleum Corp., 990 F.2d 25 (1st Cir. 
1993). "
1357,2," The primary line theory was based on the fact that Coastal is a subsidiary of CFMI, a company that provides marine fuel to 
ships. CFMI's usual supplier of bunker fuel was its sister corporation, Coastal States Trading, Inc. (""CSTI""). CSTI is a competitor 
of CAPECO in other markets. Because, on this theory, the discrimination adversely impacted competition with CAPECO's 
competitors, the case could be a primary line case. The Morton Salt presumption, discussed below, does not apply to primary 
line cases. "
1359,3," The description of Coastal's economic analysis methodology as a ""but-for"" methodology is itself puzzling. As one set of 
commentators has noted HN1[
] as to the measure of antitrust damages: The plaintiff must show that the defendant's illegal conduct prevented the plaintiff from doing better than it actually did. The 
plaintiff must therefore project a hypothetical or ""but-for"" condition that excludes only the effects of the defendant's illegal 
conduct. The difference between that projected condition and the plaintiff's actual condition (both stated in terms of some 
standard index, like profits or prices) is the claimed measure of damages. . . . . . . The plaintiff must project what its performance would have been in the damage period but for the violation from a base 
experience unaffected by the violation. . . . The relevant actual causal factors are determined by the evidentiary foundation 
the plaintiff offers for its projection. . . . The most common evidentiary foundations [are]: the plaintiff's own performance 
before (or after) the illegal conduct or the performance of some ""yardstick"" firm. R. Blair & W. Page, ""Speculative"" Antitrust Damages, 70 Wash. L. Rev. 423, 426-28 (1995) (footnotes omitted). ""But-for"" 
describes plaintiff's causation burden: it does not describe an economic methodology for calculating what plaintiff's ""but-for"" 
income or profits would have been. ""But for"" is what plaintiffs must prove and that burden is there even when the ""yardstick"" or 
""before and after"" methods, two accepted methods of economic analysis, are used. Saying that is not to say one way or another 
whether there was an adequate evidentiary foundation in economic theory for the testimony of plaintiff's expert under Daubert, 
see Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 594-95, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469, 113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993); only that it 
is misleading to use the ""but-for"" label in this context. "
1360,4," The going-concern value is what a willing buyer given all available information would have paid a willing seller. See 2 P. Areeda 
& H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law § 365b4, at 243-44 (rev. ed. 1995) (noting that going-concern value ""would ordinarily be the 
same as anticipated future profits, capitalized and discounted to the present and also discounted for future risk"" (footnotes 
omitted)). "
1361,5," In the first trial the district court did not ask the jury to determine going-concern value. Instead, the court told the jury that it 
could award both actual lost profits and projected future lost profits. The first jury combined total damages into one award of $ 
1.5 million. "
1362,6," Dr. Freyre apparently agreed with Coastal's argument that going-concern value should be assessed at a time of market 
stability, stating that ""if [a firm] was damaged. . . you should apply the regular business conditions."" But Freyre did not state 
when he believed such conditions existed, although he stated that such conditions did not exist while the excise tax was in 
place. "
1363,7," CAPECO also argues that it would have refused to deal with Coastal regardless of this dispute, and that it is highly unlikely that 
Coastal would have remained in the San Juan market given this refusal to deal. As discussed later, this was a jury issue, 
decided against CAPECO. "
1364,8," An issue may arise concerning what role the subsequent real-world events should play in determining such a value. See 
generally Note, Private Treble Damage Antitrust Suits: Measure of Damages for Destruction of All or Part of a Business, 80 
Harv. L. Rev. 1566 (1967). Any model attempting to estimate going-concern value bears risks of not accurately capturing in a 
hypothetical world what would have happened in the real world if there were no price discrimination. This is true of evidence of 
post-1993 real world events as well. The parties may be able to reach agreement on a model. If not, the trial court will have to 
exercise its gatekeeper function as to both relevance and reliability. See Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 119 S. Ct. 
1167, 1999 U.S. LEXIS 2189, *14, 143 L. Ed. 2d 238 (U.S. 1999). But because no one has briefed the issue to us, we do 
nothing more than note the issue. "
1365,9," Earlier, in ordering the reversal of the award of antitrust damages, we commented that ""in coming to its conclusion, the jury 
may well have weighed harms resulting from conduct that was pleaded with respect to the monopolization offense (e.g. refusal 
to deal with a customer, lying, etc.) but would have been additional to harms resulting from price discrimination, the claim we 
uphold."" Coastal Fuels, 79 F.3d at 200-01. This statement does not support CAPECO's claim that its refusal to deal precludes 
the award of post-1993 damages. The mention of refusal to deal here was merely an example of a possible area where facts 
alleged with regard to the monopolization claims would not have been relevant to the price-discrimination claims. Cf.  id. at 201 
n.16 (""As a practical matter, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for a juror to segregate antitrust damages due to a 
monopolization offense but not due to illegal price discrimination from antitrust damages due only to price discrimination, where 
as here, the facts and conduct involved in both allegations greatly overlap."")."
1365,10," CAPECO did attempt to have its damages expert, Jerry Hausman, testify that Wilfredo Rodriguez, the CAPECO executive 
who had written a letter to Coastal threatening to cut off Coastal's supply of fuel if this action was not dropped, had indicated that 
CAPECO would have cut off supply to Coastal even absent the lawsuit. This statement was stricken as hearsay and improper 
expert testimony. In its brief to this court in the prior appeal, CAPECO took a position at odds with its current argument when it 
stated that it stopped selling fuel to Coastal ""after having previously advised Coastal of its policy of not doing business with 
customers litigating against it."""
1365,11," We reach this conclusion despite the instructional error on burden of proof described later because of the complete paucity of 
evidence to support CAPECO's argument. "
1367,12," The district court's gatekeeping function extends to all expert evidence, including economic analysis, not merely to evidence 
involving scientific conclusions. See Kumho Tire, slip op. at 7-9."
1367,13," Given our finding that a new damages trial is required, we need not reach CAPECO's claim that Coastal's evidence, and in 
particular the testimony of Sherwin, was insufficient to support the jury award. "
1368,14," Of course, both CAPECO and Coastal can attack the admissibility or validity of expert testimony on other grounds at retrial. 
And the district court, under Daubert, is free to make its own determinations as to whether, on the facts presented at remand, a 
particular methodology is adequate. "

1373,7," Plaintiffs make numerous arguments for irreparable injury, most unsupported by citations to the evidence. The court 
summarizes only plaintiffs' assertions that are supported by evidence. "
1375,8," The court grants plaintiffs' April 12, 1999 motion for permission to file a supplemental appendix. The court has considered the 
supplemental appendix, but concludes that it does not alter the court's analysis or the result. "
1378,1," As it has done throughout its previous orders, this Court will use ""Hyundai"" to refer collectively to the three defendants: 1) 
Hyundai Electronics Industries Company, Limited, 2) Hyundai Electronics America, Incorporated, and 3) Hyundai Semiconductor 
America, Incorporated. For the limited purposes of this opinion, there is no need to distinguish between these three Hyundai 
entities. If individual reference is necessary, this Court will so refer. "
1379,2," This Court's published, February 4, 1999 Memorandum and Opinion Order [195] interpreting the parties' License Agreement 
can be found on Westlaw at 1999 WL 179322 (E.D.Tex.). This Court continues to experience an extraordinary amount of deja vu 
throughout this patent misuse defense. It fully embraces, adopts, and endorses its February 4, 1999 Memorandum and Opinion 
Order [195]."
1379,3," In fact, three were transferred from the Eastern District of Virginia."
1379,4," At the first day of the bench trial, counsel for Hyundai, Mr. Frankel, complained that ""this trial, Your Honor, has gone down at a 
very fast pace, obviously."" Trial Transcript April 6, 1999 p. 124. The Court responded to Mr. Frankel's concern: ""It's only coming 
down rapidly. I think, by what appears to be the tactical design of Hyundai to submit an amended defense at an extremely late 
date in a trial. So any detriment that you may suffer because of that, it is because, I think, Hyundai may have brought the 
amendment up fairly late in the trial. So whatever short period of time is there is somewhat of Hyundai's own doing."" Id. at p. 
126. Specifically, this Court refers counsel for Hyundai (and any interested reader) to its Memorandum and Opinion Order 
wherein it reluctantly permitted Hyundai to amend its answer merely six (6) days before trial despite the dilatory findings 
delineated within that order. "
1380,5," Throughout the parties' motions, briefing, and bench trial on Hyundai's defense of patent misuse, this Court experienced a 
tremendous amount of deja vu--particularly, since Hyundai's patent misuse defense hinges on its ""TI Country Concept"" and its 
""covered"" versus ""uncovered"" products argument specifically rejected by this Court in its Court's February 4, 1999 Memorandum 
and Opinion Order [195]. In that opinion, this Court rejected Hyundai's ""covered"" versus ""uncovered"" products theory and found 
that, in fact, ""royalty bearing products"" included Hyundai's worldwide products regardless of individual patent coverage by Texas 
Instruments of that product within the particular country in which that product was sold (the sheer wordiness involved in stating 
Hyundai's ""TI Country Concept"" points to its tortured ineptness)."
1380,6," Indeed, the Court received cross-motions, replies, and sur-replies. It also held an extensive hearing on the parties' differing 
interpretations of the License Agreement. "
1381,7," All of this unnecessary cross-referencing and partial provision-incorporation is what left this fifty-five (55) page License 
Agreement susceptible to multiple interpretations (the legal profession has always been hesitant to simply say what it means 
without self-affirming legalese and complication). This Court found Hyundai's ""TI Country Concept"" interpretation of the License 
Agreement an unreasonable interpretation. Further, it found Texas Instruments' interpretation of the License Agreement the only 
reasonable interpretation of the parties' License Agreement. "
1382,8," It also dismissed Hyundai's counterclaim for declaratory judgment in Civil Action No. 2:98-cv-73 (the ""73 Case""). That 
counterclaim for declaratory judgment came to this Court from Hyundai's declaratory judgment action filed in the Southern 
District of New York on May 1, 1998--the same day Texas Instruments initiated its patent infringement litigation against Hyundai. 
In dismissing Hyundai's lawsuit, the Honorable Judge Patterson of the United States District Court for the Southern District of 
New York found that ""plaintiff's [Hyundai's] actions… 'make a total mockery of [this Court's] order' and constitute a failure to 
participate in good faith in discovery ordered by the Court."" "
1383,9," Both of these patents--the '674 and '613 patents--are also known as the ""Head Patents"" named after their inventor, Texas 
Instruments scientist Claude D. Head, III. "
1384,10," The portfolio license discussion appears in the opinion strictly for background purposes. More than once this Court specifically 
noted that it would not rely upon this information in its interpretation of the parties' unambiguous License Agreement. "
1385,11," As this Court demonstrated in its February 4, 1999 Memorandum and Opinion Order [195] interpreting this License 
Agreement, specific provisions within the contract militate against the patent-by-patent, product-by-product, country-by-country 
licensing interpretation proposed by Hyundai's ""TI Country Concept"" interpretation."
1385,12, No relation. 
1386,13," For simplicity, this Court will round this amount to one hundred ten million United States dollars ($ 110,000,000.00)."
1386,14," Nevertheless, settling a lawsuit by inventing a novel provision and inserting it into part of the settlement agreement is a rather 
bold strategy. "
1387,15, Subtracting out any Y2K perturbations.
1387,16," In its February 4, 1999 Memorandum and Opinion Order [195] interpreting the parties' License Agreement, this Court could 
see no reason for the contract to actually say 1.1 times some number. Now, with the full admission of this extrinsic evidence, the 
reason for the added math becomes apparent."
1387,17, Don't smoke those cigars just yet; the newborn is about to cause a ruckus. 
1388,18," Hyundai's aversion to a running royalty may, in fact, have been a concerted effort by Hyundai to protect itself from its own 
growth."
1388,19," Since the signing of the License Agreement, Hyundai's sales grew along the lines of one thousand percent (1000%). "
1389,20, Notwithstanding any strained interpretations of the portfolio License Agreement's language.
1389,21," A patently, some countries merely require a small fee and a little paperwork to register patents within their borders. "
1391,22," The In re Recombinant Court faced an alleged ""tie-out"" form of patent misuse--the type of patent misuse Hyundai is asserting 
against Texas Instruments. After examining the case law of patent misuse and the statutory history of the 1988 Patent Misuse 
Reform Act, that Court specifically refused Lily's argument that § 271(d)(5) was limited to ""tie-ins."" What is the difference 
between a ""tie-in"" and a the ""tie-out?"" ""Through the years, courts have found per se patent misuse in varying forms of tying 
arrangements. In some cases, the patentee is conditioning the license of his patent on the licensee agreeing to use some 
specific unpatented product [a ""tie-in""]…In other cases, the patentee is conditioning the license of his patent on the licensee 
agreeing not to use the products or devices of a competitor [a ""tie-out]."" In re Recombinant, 850 F. Supp. 760 at 776; see also 
Kenneth M. Frankel, Problems in Licensing Intellectual Property for Software and Computer Technology, Important Antitrust and 
Misuse Considerations, 479 PLI/Pat 733, 776-77 (1997). The In re Recombinant Court could ""[]not find an instance in which a 
court has indicated that the two tying arrangements should be treated differently."" In re Recombinant, 850 F. Supp. at 776. Ditto. "
1394,23," Before (rather extensive) summation, this Court specifically inquired as to the sales-cap clause's uniqueness: The Court: ""Are there any cases--has this case ever been tried before with the facts [sales-cap provision]…that are before 
it?…I can't find any case that is identical to this…"" Mr. Beck [for Hyundai]: ""Your Honor, the results of your research are consistent with the results of our research."" Mr. Roth [for Texas Instruments]: ""…There is no case specifically on point, not a white horse case."" April 6, 1999 Trial Transcript, p. 476. "
1395,24," Indeed, the only Hyundai products that could possibly be considered as those ""covered"" by valid Texas Instruments patents 
would be those involved in this lawsuits--the '674 and '613 ""Head"" patents. But, under Hyundai's ""TI Country Concept"" 
interpretation, as this Court writes this opinion even these products are indeterminate as Hyundai's patent misuse defense 
prevents entry of judgment. "
1397,25," Here's the problem: Hyundai built a one billion three hundred million dollar ($ 1,300,000,000.00) semiconductor manufacturing 
facility in Eugene, Oregon--a facility that uses Texas Instruments '674 and '613 ""Head"" patents to manufacture semiconductor 
products. Hyundai argues that ""without a license from TI, Hyundai had no alternative to the Head patents and would have to shut 
down its $ 1.3 billion fabrication facility in Eugene, Oregon."" Hyundai's Memorandum Brief 25. Hyundai tries to use this as an 
example of market power. It isn't. It merely represents a calculated risk voluntarily taken by Hyundai--not market power forced 
upon Hyundai by Texas Instruments."
1397,26," Since Hyundai has failed as a matter of fact to establish either per se patent misuse or just plain patent misuse due to tying, 
this Court does not reach the decision whether Texas Instruments ""purged"" its alleged misuse--for there is no need to purge 
something that never existed. "
1404,1," Measured by revenue passenger miles, Northwest was the world's fourth largest passenger airline as of 1993. The airline's 
annual revenues exceeded $ 9 billion in 1995 and 1996. [2nd Amend. Compl., P 4]."
1404,2," Unlike a traditional resale distribution scheme, where a dealer purchases an inventory of products/services from a 
manufacturer/service provider for resale, travel agents generally do not maintain a separate inventory of airlines tickets/seats 
and, as such, do not bear the risk of unsold inventory. Furthermore, travel agents have no authority to set prices, and no ability 
to sell a seat without first checking with an airline for availability. See, Illinois Corporate Travel, Inc. v. American Airlines, Inc., 
806 F.2d 722, 725 (7th Cir. 1986); 2nd Amend. Compl., P 8."

1405,7," As of September 29, 1995, a one-way full fare New York-Detroit ticket cost approximately $ 394.00, while a one-way full fare 
New York-Detroit-Columbus combination ticket cost $ 238.73. [2nd Amend. Compl., P40]."
1405,8," From 1990 to 1996, Northwest controlled 70-75% of departures from Detroit; 69-77% of departures from Memphis; and 77-79% 
of departures from Minneapolis/St. Paul. In addition, as of October 1996, Northwest controlled approximately 74% of the gates at 
Detroit's Metropolitan Airport. [2nd Amend. Compl., PP 24, 26]."
1405,9," Plaintiff cites an April 1996 Department of Transportation study which found that in comparison to passengers flying in non-
dominated markets of similar distance and density, Detroit residents and visitors paid 2.2% more in 1988, 22.2% more in 1994, 
and 20.7% more in the first three quarters of 1995. The figures for Minneapolis for the same time periods were 23%, 42.3%, and 
40.8%. Similarly, Memphis' figures were 32.9%, 35.5%, and 35.9%. [2nd Amend. Compl., P 29]. "

agreement"" with Northwest. [Brief in Opposition, pp. 28, 30; See also, 2nd Amend Compl., P 87(b)]. Likewise, Plaintiff 
acknowledges the unilateral nature of Northwest's conduct: ""ARC has pledged that it will use the combined market power of its 
140 airlines to blindly support any rule that an airline member unilaterally imposes on travel agents, regardless of how improper 
or illegal the rule may be."" [Brief in Opposition, p. 35]. "
1410,16," As discussed, infra, the midwives also alleged § 1 conspiracies by several pediatricians on one hospital staff and by several 
obstetricians on another hospital staff. "
1412,17," ARC claims that if it is ""treated as a joint venture of other airlines, their competitive interest would be to prevent Northwest from 
achieving a monopoly, not to promote it."" [Reply Brief, p. 9, emphasis in original]."
1412,18," Defendants also argue that an anti-trust plaintiff cannot state a valid claim under either § 1 or § 2 of the Sherman Act by 
alleging only anti-competitive effects on intrabrand competition. For the reasons stated in detail in the discussion of Plaintiff's § 2 
claim, the Court finds Defendants' argument without merit under the facts and circumstances as pled in this case. "
1413,19," For the purposes of their present motions only, Defendants concede that Plaintiff has adequately pled monopoly power in the 
relevant market, air routes originating or terminating at one of Northwest's hub airports."
1413,20," The Supreme Court has explained the distinction between interbrand and intrabrand competition as follows: Interbrand competition is the competition among the manufactures of the same generic product-- television sets in this case 
-- and is the primary concern of antitrust law. The extreme example of a deficiency of interbrand competition is monopoly, 
where there is only one manufacturer. In contrast, intrabrand competition is the competition between the distributors -- 
wholesale or retail -- of the product of a particular manufacturer. Crane & Shovel Sales Corporation v. Bucyrus-Erie Co., 854 F.2d 802 (6th Cir. 1988) (quoting Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE 
Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 52 n. 19, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 2558 n. 19, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977))."
1413,21," Defendants provided the Court with a copy of the Second Circuit's decision in the Electronics Communications case at oral 
argument. "
1415,22," In enumerating this requirement, the Eleventh Circuit commented: A restriction of intrabrand competition may -- depending on the interbrand market structure -- either enhance or diminish 
overall competition, and hence consumer welfare. As one commentator puts it, 'the real issue remains whether the loss of 
intrabrand competition itself injures or benefits potential consumers of the brand in question. Those consumers are injured 
by the restraint if, without obtaining more services, they are denied intrabrand choices that are sources of consumer 
welfare, but are benefitted [notwithstanding the restraint] if dealer services increase."" Gerhart, The ""Competitive 
Advantages"" Explanation For Intrabrand Restraints: An Antitrust Analysis, 1981 Duke L.J. 417, 439. Moreover, if enhanced 
dealer services to the consumer result from the restraint, intrabrand competition should be sharpened. Itek, 717 F.2d at 1571-1572."
1415,23," While noting that the burden was on GPD to show that the restraint in question was ""substantially adverse to market 
competition,"" the Eleventh Circuit expressly stated that ""Itek was free to come forward with a showing that, notwithstanding its 
market power, the vertical restraints were reasonably necessary to achieve legitimate, pro-competitive purposes, and that the 
purpose and effect of the restraints were pro-competitive when viewed as a whole."" 717 F.2d at 1573. At trial, Itek offered two 
pro-competitive justifications for its territorial restraints: (1) to provide adequate servicing for its equipment to customers in 
outlying areas; and (2) to enhance market penetration.  Id. at 1577-1578. "
1421,*," The Honorable H. Dale Cook, United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, sitting by designation."
1421,1," Although they filed and pled their case as a class action, plaintiffs have apparently not sought class certification."
1421,2," Plaintiffs also brought claims under RICO and various state laws. Defendants filed motions to dismiss the civil RICO and fraud 
claims, which the district court denied. After the court granted summary judgment to defendants on the federal antitrust claim, 
plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint to dismiss the RICO claim. The court granted that motion and, on its own initiative, 
dismissed the state law claims as well for lack of continued supplemental jurisdiction. "
1422,3," While there are nine named insurance company defendants, some of them are related, so that there are, ""functionally 
speaking,"" five companies. See Memorandum and Order at 5, Appellants' App. Vol. XIV at 3768."
1422,4," Concurrent review was introduced because it theoretically permits more efficient and economic care by avoiding unnecessary 
treatments before they are provided. Its success in that regard is, however, unclear."
1422,5," The district court stated that ""there is no evidence regarding which survey, if any, the other Insurers consulted to evaluate the 
reasonableness of chiropractic claims not referred to Intracorp."" Memorandum and Order at 10 n.11, Appellants' App. Vol. XIV at 
3773. "
1423,6," As did the district court, we have experienced frustration in attempting to extract relevant facts from the voluminous record in 
this case. Plaintiffs at times make global statements about defendants' conduct, but a review of the record citation upon which 
they rely indicates that the conduct applies to only one defendant. For example, in discussing Intracorp's TCR service, plaintiffs 
state that ""under this program all chiropractic bills were reviewed by Intracorp."" Appellants' Br. at 5. The record citations, 
Appellants' App. Vol. V at 1271-72, Vol. VII at 1833, only support the conclusion that Farm Bureau, for some unspecified period 
of time, referred all chiropractic claims to Intracorp. The number of chiropractic claims actually submitted by Farm Bureau to 
Intracorp is unclear. Moreover, that particular record citation reveals nothing about any of the Insurers other than Farm Bureau."
1423,7," As the district court observed, ""Barr fails to mention a few other interesting points. Insurers refused to pay for at least one visit 
for 60% of all claims in which the number of visits was thirty or fewer. Insurers cut 76% of all 749 files down to twenty-five or 
fewer sessions. They cut 56% of all files to twenty or fewer sessions."" Memorandum and Order at 15, Appellants' App. Vol. XIV 
at 3778. Further, ""of the 282 patient files indicating more than thirty treatment sessions, Insurers paid for twenty or fewer 
sessions 33% of the time, twenty-one to twenty-five sessions 26% of the time, twenty-six to thirty sessions 23% of the time, and 
more than thirty sessions 18% of the time."" Id. at 15-16, Appellants' App. Vol. XIV at 3778-79. "
1424,8," Both in the district court and on appeal, no one has separately discussed the claims based on Kansas law. See Memorandum 
and Order at 3 n.4, Appellants' App. Vol. XIV at 3766. The district court concluded ""that state and federal law are functionally 
equivalent,"" and did not separately analyze plaintiffs' claims under state law. Id. Like the district court, we conclude that our 
resolution under federal law adequately disposes of plaintiffs' claims under state law. "
1425,9," Were we to consider the Lee affidavit as circumstantial evidence of an antitrust conspiracy, we agree with the Insurers and the 
district court that the affidavit is unpersuasive because much of it is conclusory, vague, and/or lacking in foundation. A crucial 
paragraph purporting to state Mr. Lee's personal knowledge of an anticompetitive agreement states that ""Farmers and other 
auto carriers, including State Farm, Kansas Farm Bureau, Shelter and possibly Trinity had an agreement or understanding that 
we all needed to be using uniform pricing and treatment schedules in paying auto first and third party medical claims."" Lee Aff. P 
4, Appellants' App. Vol. VIII at 2203-04. Mr. Lee fails to state how he learned of this agreement, who exactly represented the 
other insurance companies, how he could speak for what they wanted or needed, when this agreement or understanding was 
formed, and how it was to operate. "
1426,10," As the court stated, ""consideration of the struck papers would have made no difference in the court's resolution of any issue in 
light of the court's other rulings on plaintiffs' presentation of the facts."" Appellants' App. Vol. XIV at 3864."
1426,11," Technically, having affirmed the district court's decision to strike plaintiffs' responsive documents, we could simply affirm 
summary judgment to defendants on the ground that plaintiffs have failed to controvert defendants' evidence demonstrating the 
absence of an antitrust conspiracy. See Universal Money Centers, Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 22 F.3d 1527, 1529 (10th 
Cir. 1994) (noting that once the moving party carries its initial burden to show the absence of an issue of genuine fact, non- "
1427,," moving party may not rest on allegations in pleadings, but ""'must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for 
trial'"" (quoting Applied Genetics Int'l, Inc. v. First Affiliated Sec., Inc., 912 F.2d 1238, 1241 (10th Cir. 1990)). However, like the 
district court, we alternatively address the merits of the grant of summary judgment, on the assumption that plaintiffs at least 
attempted to controvert defendants' averments. "
1428,12," Plaintiffs characterize CIGNA as a ""giant insurance conglomerate."" Appellants' Br. at 15. Plaintiffs further assert that ""there 
was abundant evidence of a concerted effort by CIGNA to ensure that Intracorp was furthering the purposes of CIGNA and its 
insurance company subsidiaries."" Id. at 21. However, as Intracorp points out, that ""abundant evidence"" consists of various facts, 
or circumstances, which are typical of any parent and subsidiary. Our review of the record, as illuminated by plaintiffs' record 
citations, fully supports the district court's conclusion that ""there is no evidence of any involvement by Intracorp's parent or sister 
corporations in this case [and t]here is no evidence that Intracorp is merely the alter ego of its parent or sister corporations."" 
Memorandum and Order at 26, Appellants' App. Vol. XIV at 3789. "
1430,13," In support of this argument, plaintiffs rely upon a chart showing the average cost, the 80% cost and the 90% cost for one 
chiropractic procedure. Appellants' App. Vol. VI at 1445. Aside from the fact that this chart relates to only one chiropractic 
procedure, which makes extrapolations about all chiropractic procedures difficult, it also in fact shows an increase in the average 
cost of that procedure from 1990 through 1993, as well as increases in the 80% and 90% figures. This hardly supports the 
inference that the Insurers were engaged in a conspiracy to reduce costs."
1430,14," At the hearing on plaintiffs' motion to recuse, one of plaintiffs' counsel conceded that they were not arguing any personal bias 
or prejudice on the part of Judge Belot. "
1431,15," Plaintiffs suggest that Judge Belot's or his former partner's prior representation of insurance companies may not have been 
""unrelated"" to this case. ""The actions taken may well have been part of the overall strategy of some of the insurers to cap 
chiropractic reimbursement rates."" Appellants' Br. at 48. That is pure speculation; there is absolutely no evidence connecting any 
prior litigation involving Judge Belot or his former partner and this case. "

procedures shall require that prospective users of the information identify themselves, certify the purposes for which the

and ascertain what those purposes are. It should obtain a specific, written certification that the recipient will obtain reports 
for those purposes and no others. The user's certification that the report will be used for no other purposes should 
expressly prohibit the user from sharing the report or providing it to anyone else, other than the subject of the report or to a 
joint user having the same purpose. A consumer reporting agency should refuse to provide reports to those refusing to 
provide such certification."

1437,2," The July 1, 1996, contract is printed on ""Credit Bureau Associates of Tennessee"" letterhead; the August 1, 1996, letter 
agreement is on ""CBA Tennessee/CBA Information Services"" letterhead. According to Walter Wojciechowski, Comptroller and 
Chief Operating Officer of Credit Bureau Associates, Credit Bureau Associates is a partnership comprised of three corporate 
partners. The three partners are Suburban Credit Bureau, Inc. and Camden Credit Association, Inc.--both New Jersey 
corporations with a principal place of business in Cherry Hill, New Jersey--and Credit Information Consultants, Ltd., a 
Pennsylvania corporation with its principal place of business in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Credit Bureau Associates does 
business as CBA Information Services and maintains divisions in Tennessee (""CBA Tennessee"") and Florida (""Datafax CBA 
Information Services""). (Wojciechowski Aff. P 4.) "
1439,3," This paragraph is somewhat illustrative of the problems in this Amended Complaint, leading to some evident confusion among 
the defendants as well as the Court. It is not clear to whom the ""it"" refers; nor is it clear who obtained the reports from the plaintiff 
and which end users were affected. Additionally, the paragraph goes on to state, ""A copy of said notification is annexed hereto 
and made a part hereof, as exhibit F,"" but there is no such exhibit appended to the Amended Complaint. Exhibit E is the last 
exhibit."
1439,4," Mr. Wolf filed two declarations dated August 8, 1998. The one cited here has 32 numbered paragraphs. (The other one 
consists of 44 numbered paragraphs.) At an evidentiary hearing for a preliminary injunction on June 17, 1998, Mr. Wolf testified he would not sign Experian's request 
for a release for inspection of CCIS's compliance with FCRA requirements because in his opinion Experian does not have the 
right to grant or withhold permission to sell over the Internet. He also testified that he had not completed the application to 
become an Equifax customer. (Tr. at 44-45, 53.)"
1439,5," Qspace apparently provides consumers with copies of their own credit reports, as opposed to other parties. (Am. Compl. Ex. D 
(Qspace press release).) "
1440,6," Affiliates are defined elsewhere in the Amended Complaint as ""local credit bureaus."" (Am. Compl. P 33.) "
1441,7," CBA argues that CCIS has misstated its names and corporate status. Equifax argues that CCIS has sued the wrong entity. As 
the Amended Complaint is dismissed for other reasons, these arguments need not be addressed."
1441,8," ""That market"" is not defined in claim 18. (Am. Comp. PP 272-280.) ""That market"" appears to be the market for triple-merge 
reports, (id. P 43), but the Amended Complaint also mentions without defining ""the Mortgage Credit Reporting Market"" (id. PP 
51-52), and ""the market for mortgage reporting services, including residential mortgage credit reports."" (Id. P 74.) See also infra 
at 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6084, *30-*31, note 15. "
1442,9," ""Pl. Mem. Opp. Experian"" refers to CCIS's memorandum of law submitted in opposition to Experian's motion to dismiss. CCIS 
submitted a separate opposition brief to each of the defendants' motions. "
1443,10," The allegation that ""defendants CBA, Experian and Equifax are aware that CDB Infotek has used and has continued to use 
the Internet to deliver their data and have permitted it in contradiction to their stated policies"" (id. P 278) is conclusory, is based 
on information and belief, and is insufficiently supported by substantive factual allegations."
1443,11," Oreck involved a directed verdict following trial. But its holding may be applied to a motion to dismiss. Mere allegations of 
close relations or frequent meetings between the alleged conspirators cannot state a claim under § 1 absent allegations that 
could permit an inference that those close ties led to an illegal agreement."
1443,12, The remainder came from TransUnion and Equifax.
1443,13," Affiliates are defined in the Amended Complaint as ""local credit bureaus."" (Am. Compl. P 33.)"
1443,14," The Amended Complaint does state, ""On information and belief, First American Credco, part of First American Real Estate 
Solutions, LLC, (First American RES) which was formed by defendants Experian in December, 1997, is the nation's largest 
provider of mortgage credit information and a large Experian consumer credit customer"" (Am. Compl. P 11), but the relevance of 
First American RES to plaintiff's claims remains murky. "
1444,15," Plaintiff cites P 40 for the contention that ""all the parties involved compete with one another in that they supply credit reports 
for a price in the downstream market."" (Pl. Mem. Opp. Experian at 16; emphasis in original.) That paragraph states: ""By virtue of 
plaintiff's Internet capability, plaintiff was able, and did compete, along with defendants, attracting clients heretofore those of 
defendants or its affiliates, in the national market until defendants illegally extinguished plaintiff's access to the essential product 
of defendants Experian and defendant Equifax, as will be more fully alleged below."" (Am. Compl. P 40.) However, nowhere else 
in the Amended Complaint does the plaintiff state the name of any client it attracted away from the defendants or their affiliates. 
As noted above, the relationship between Experian and its ""affiliates"" is not explicated. Moreover, plaintiff's argument on this point highlights another deficiency in the Amended Complaint: its failure to define the 
relevant market with specificity. At times it refers to the market for triple-merge reports (id. P 43) and at other times the 
""Mortgage Credit Reporting Market."" (Id. P 51.) Neither is defined with enough particularity or specificity to satisfy Rule 8(a)(2) 
and to assist the defendants (and the Court) in determining what the plaintiff is talking about and how competition is restrained in 
that market. "
1445,16, CCIS concedes that it is not alleging attempted monopolization. (Pl. Mem Opp. Experian at 16; Pl. Mem Opp. Equifax at 19.)
1445,17, It seems apparent that CBA does distribute triple merge reports as Pyramid Reports. (Am. Compl. Ex. B.) 
1446,18," Plaintiff also alleges that Experian and Equifax are essential facilities. The essential facility doctrine is only available to 
competitors, not to customers. Twin Laboratories, Inc. v. Weider Health and Fitness, 900 F.2d 566, 568-69 (2d Cir. 1990). The 
Amended Complaint states: Plaintiff, Credit Chequers Information Services, Inc., is a Consumer Reporting Agency (CRA) and Individual Reference 
Service, as defined by the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Federal Trade Commission, engaged in the business of 
reselling consumer credit information purchased from other sources on a ""value-added"" basis. Plaintiff maintains high 
standards of compliance with Federal, State, and local code applicable to its industry. (Am. Compl. P 88.) Nowhere does the Amended Complaint allege that Experian or Equifax sells triple-merge reports. It alleges 
instead that their reports are available through ""local credit bureaus, (termed affiliates)."" (Id. P 33.) It does allege that Experian 
""has become a direct competitor in the Mortgage Credit Reporting Market"" (id. P 52), but this is a conclusory allegation and the 
market is undefined. As the triple-merge report market is the relevant market at issue, supra at 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6084, *30-
*31, note 15, CCIS's allegations with respect to Experian's and Equifax's ""affiliates"" are immaterial and do not help state a claim 
for relief. "
1447,19," Claim 19 is a claim for injunctive relief. As none of the other claims on which a claim for injunctive relief could be based 
survives the motion to dismiss, claim 19 is also dismissed. "

(Burton, J., dissenting). The club could unilaterally renew the player's contract when it expired, or release the player, or assign 
the player's contract to any other team, which would then have the same rights to the player's services. See id. at 362-63, n.10.

1466,2," 9 U.S.C. § 4 HN5[
] provides, in pertinent part: The court shall hear the parties, and upon being satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration . . . is not in issue, 
the court shall make an order directing the parties to proceed to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement . 
. . If the making of the arbitration agreement . . . be in issue, the court shall proceed summarily to the trial thereof. "
1467,3," Simula cites both Mediterranean Enter. and Tracer Research Corp. v. National Envt'l Serv. Co., 42 F.3d 1292 (9th Cir. 1994), to 
support its contention that the disputed arbitration clause should be narrowly construed. Neither of these cases, however, 
controls the language in the present clause: Mediterranean Enter. interpreted a clause providing for any disputes ""arising 
hereunder,"" see 708 F.2d at 1464, and Tracer Research involved an arbitration clause providing for arbitration of claims ""arising 
out of"" the agreement, see 42 F.3d at 1295. Such language is considerably more narrow in scope than the language at issue 
here. "
1469,4," In fact, it is possible that the Swiss Tribunal might apply U.S. antitrust law to the dispute. Although Simula offers the 
declaration of a Swiss legal expert to support its claim that U.S. antitrust law will not be applied, the expert also declared that 
the Swiss Tribunal is likely to apply U.S. law in situations affecting U.S. markets. Moreover, even if Swiss law is applied to the 
dispute, there has been no showing that it will not provide Simula with sufficient protection. "
1470,5," Simula argues that Desktop Images, Inc. v. Ames, 929 F. Supp. 1339 (D. Colo. 1996) dictates that claims under the Lanham 
Act are not arbitrable. The arbitration clause in Desktop Images, however, was considerably more narrow than the 1995 
Agreement (contract provided for arbitration of claims ""arising thereunder""), see id. at 1345. "
1486,1," Section 1331 of Title 28 of the United States Code states, ""The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions 
arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States."""
1486,2," The general requirements of diversity jurisdiction, as relates to the present action, are described in subsection (a) of section 
1332: HN1[
] The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or 
value of $ 75,000.00, exclusive of interest and costs, and is between -- (1) citizens of different States. . . ."
1486,28, U.S.C. § 1332(a)(1). 
1487,3," HN4[
] BLACK'S LAW DICTONARY (6th ed. 1990) defines a suit brought ex relatione as a ""legal proceeding[] which [is] 
instituted by the attorney general (or other proper person) in the name and behalf of the state, but on the information and that the 
instigation of an individual who has a private interest in the matter. . . ."" The ""relator"" is the individual who brings the action on 
behalf of the state. Thus, the instant case is mis-styled, as the action is brought by the State of Alabama, ex relatione, that is, 
upon the information or relation of, Wynn.  Cf.  State ex rel. Baker v. Evans, 683 So. 2d 421 (Ala. 1996); Carr v. State ex ret. 
Goggans, 720 So. 2d 197 (Ala. 1996); and Dunlap v. State ex rel. Durrett, 622 So. 2d 1305 (Ala. 1993). "
1488,4," HN5[
] Section 6-6-590(a) of the Alabama Code of 1975 provides that ""an action may be commenced . . ., in the name of the state, against the offending corporation, on the information of any person for the purpose of vacating the charter or annulling the 
existence of any corporation. . ., "" where the corporation performs one of a number of offending acts."
1488,5," Under this section, [HN6[
] a] defendant or defendants desiring to remove any civil action . . . from a State court shall file in the district court 
of the United States for the district and division within which such action is pending a notice of removal signed pursuant to 
Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and containing a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal, 
together with a copy of all process, pleadings, and orders served upon such defendant or defendants in such action."
1488,28, U.S.C. § 1446(a).
1488,6," The date of the notice of removal was June 22, 1998."
1488,7," HN7[
] A plaintiff can move to remand a removed case to state court ""on the basis of any defect other than subject matter jurisdiction . . . within 30 days after the filing of the notice of removal. . . ."" 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c). Under this scheme, non-
jurisdictional defects in removal are waived if not made within thirty (30) days after the notice of removal is filed.  In re Bethesda 
Memorial Hosp., Inc., 123 F.3d 1407, 1409-10 (11th Cir. 1997). However, a motion to remand grounded on a lack of subject-
matter jurisdiction can be made at any time.  In re Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co., 104 F.3d 322, 324 (11th Cir. 1997). There is a 
third category of grounds for remand, those cases in which remand is premised on neither a ""defect"" in the removal process nor 
a jurisdictional flaw, as in the case of federal abstention doctrine, denial of supplemental jurisdiction or the existence of a forum 
selection clause. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has recently concluded that a remand premised on one of these non-
jurisdictional, non-defect grounds does not fall within the thirty day limitations period and can be the subject of appellate review.  
Snapper v. Redan, 171 F.3d 1249, 1259, 1999 WL 184017 at *8 (11th Cir. 1999)."
1488,8," In so holding, this court cited to and explained Ames v. State of Kansas, 111 U.S. 449, 28 L. Ed. 482, 4 S. Ct. 437 (1884), in 
which the Supreme Court permitted removal of a quo warranto action premised on federal question jurisdiction. Although this 
court did not discuss the issue, presumably the plaintiff sought to claim that a state quo warranto action was akin to a divorce or 
alimony proceeding, which, even when the parties to such a proceeding are diverse, cannot be the proper subject of diversity of 
citizenship jurisdiction. See Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U.S. 689, 700-01, 119 L. Ed. 2d 468, 112 S. Ct. 2206 (1992), 
reaffirming the jurisdictional limitation set forth in Barber v. Barber, 62 U.S. (21 How.) 582, 16 L. Ed. 226 (1859). However, as the 
Supreme Court noted in Ankenbrandt, the rationale for maintaining the domestic relations exception to statutory diversity 
jurisdiction is not that the Supreme Court in Barber got its construction of the then-existing jurisdictional statute right in 
exempting domestic relations cases, but that subsequent Congresses did nothing to change or address that decision in later 
alterations of the diversity statute. See Ankenbrandt, 504 U.S. at 700. In the instant case, there is no prior exception to the 
statutory diversity jurisdiction that has been made by the Supreme Court and which has become ingrained in the structure of the 
statutory jurisdiction of the federal district courts. As such, this court found nothing exceptional about a quo warranto action 
exempting that class of cases from this court's diversity jurisdiction. "
1489,9," See this court's memorandum opinion entered on November 23, 1998, at 7-8, discussing Tapscott v. MS Dealer Service Corp., 
77 F.3d 1353, 1359 (11th Cir. 1996)."
1489,10," For simplicity's sake, this court has engaged in a bit of revisionist history in the body of the opinion. In response to the 
defendants' motion to dismiss, the plaintiff moved to amend his earlier filed pleading on January 8, 1999, to restate his quo 
warranto claim under § 6-6-591. The court granted the plaintiffs motion on January 12, 1999. After entry of this court's February 
2, 1999, order, the plaintiff filed another amended complaint, in which he again mispled the statutory source of his claim. 
Nonetheless, it is clear from the amended complaint that the plaintiff seeks his relief under § 6-6-591 of the Alabama Code of 
1975. The court refers to this second amended complaint throughout the instant opinion as ""the amended complaint."" "
1490,11," This, arguably, was not always the case. General federal question jurisdiction, with the exception of a brief period between the 
close of Adams' Federalist Administration and the opening of Jeffersonian era, was not vested in the district courts until the 
Reconstruction period, in 1875. This early predecessor to the present federal question and federal question removal statutes 
was construed to give federal district courts nearly the fullest extent of the Article III jurisdiction over federal questions. See 
Michael G. Collins, The Unfortunate History of Federal Question Removal, 71 IOWA L. REV. 717, 720-30 (1986). This included 
the ability of a federal district court to evaluate a federal law defense to a state law action in determining the presence of a 
federal question in an action initiated in or removed to federal court. Id., see especially n.68, listing decisions in which removal 
was permitted on the basis of a federal defense. The tide began to turn against the free-wheeling days of removal with the 
Supreme Court's decision in Metcalf v. City of Watertown, 128 U.S. 586, 588-89, 32 L. Ed. 543, 9 S. Ct. 173 (1888), stating that 
although it had been ""often decided by this court that a suit may be said to arise under the constitution or laws of the United 
States, within the meaning of that act, even where the federal question upon which it depends is raised, for the first time in the 
suit, by the answer or plea of the defendant,"" the grounds of removal was either to be disclosed in the plaintiffs complaint or in 
the petition for removal. In State of Tennessee v. Union & Planters' Bank, 152 U.S. 454, 461, 38 L. Ed. 511, 14 S. Ct. 654 
(1894), the Supreme Court took the conclusion of the Metcalf court a step further and explained that, with respect to the post-
reconstruction era Judiciary Acts of 1887 and 1888, federal question jurisdiction will rest with a federal court only on the basis of 
a federal claim stated on the face of the plaintiff's pleading. So it remains."
1490,12," Occasionally, a defendant will attempt removal to federal court on the basis that the plaintiff ""artificially pled"" his state law 
claims and that, in fact, the factual bases for the plaintiff's claim more readily suggest a federal, rather than state, action, or that 
the facts alleged support a federal cause of action, but no state cause of action. Either of these events may occur without 
implicating the jurisdiction of a federal district court, however. A plaintiff is permitted to deceptively plead or mis-plead his or her "
1491,," own claims to remain in state court, as long as no federal question is necessarily implied from the claims in either of the two 
ways stated in the body of this opinion. "
1496,13," For example, as a competitive injury, the plaintiff seems to assert something novel: that because of anti-competitive practices, 
a healthy alternative to the tobacco products sold by the defendants has not emerged."
1496,14," However, as has been noted by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Jairath v. Dyer, 154 F.3d at 1283, the question of 
whether there exists a substantial issue of federal law somewhat evaporates when it is the case that under the substantive 
provisions of the law itself, the plaintiff would lack standing to pursue the action. See infra. "
1497,15," The quo warranto statute gives Wynn the authority to bring his suit as a relator for the State for purposes of the quo warranto 
action only. It does not give him the ability to prosecute, on behalf of the state, any other substantive claim either under state or 
federal law. Therefore, Wynn, insofar as it is argued that he seeks to do so, can only bring his federal claim or claims on his own 
behalf, and not as a relator of the State of Alabama."
1497,16," In actuality, the plaintiff's complaint seems to focus on a conspiracy to control the cigarette market and ""suppress competition"" 
in that market. As recited, the alleged violations in question are of the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Robinson-Patman Act, 
rather than arguable attempts to enter into tying arrangements with purchasers of cigarettes under § 14 of Title 15, although this 
too may be an aspect of the plaintiff's action. "
1498,17," In Alan's of Atlanta, Inc. v. Minolta Corp., 903 F.2d 1414, 1418 n.6 (11th Cir. 1990), the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals 
discussed the wide variety of meanings ""competitive injury"" has taken: A controversy has raged (and continues to rage) over the meaning of the word ""competition"" as used in the so-called 
""competitive injury"" phrase of section 2(a) [of the Clayton Act]. See, e.g., Boise Cascade Corp. v. FTC, 267 U.S. App. D.C. 
124, 837 F.2d 1127, 1143 (Starr, J.); 837 F.2d at 1148-52 (Williams, J., concurring); id., at 1152-63 (Mikva, J., dissenting). 
The word ""competition"" as generally used in the antitrust laws seems capable of meaning different things to different people 
and, according to one commentator, can be interpreted in at least five ways. See R. BORK, THE ANTITRUST PARADOX 
58- 61 (1978). To some, ""competition"" can only mean ""any state of affairs in which consumer welfare cannot be increased 
by moving to an alternative state of affairs through judicial decree,"" id., at 61, and competitive injury under the antitrust laws 
cannot occur unless an action taken has the net effect of restricting output and raising prices, i.e., lowering consumer 
welfare. Id., at 122. See also Ball Memorial Hosp., Inc. v. Mutual Hosp. Ins., Inc., 784 F.2d 1325, 1334 (7th Cir. 1986). 
Under this interpretation a proven injury to competitors is irrelevant under the antitrust laws (including the [Robinson-
Patman Act]); the focus of inquiry is on the detrimental effects of prices on consumers, not the detrimental effect of prices 
on competitors, for rarely the twain shall meet. Judicial precedent, however, suggests that in the [Robinson-Patman Act] the meaning of competition is not so narrow, nor 
the gap between an injury to competition and an injury to competitors so wide. Indeed, many cases dealing with secondary-
line price discrimination (as does this one) hold or suggest that an injury to competition is proved by showing an injury to 
competitors. See, e.g., Falls City Indus., Inc. v. Vanco Beverage, Inc., 460 U.S. 428, 434-38, 75 L. Ed. 2d 174, 103 S. Ct. 
1282 [] (1983) (section 2(a) competitive injury shown where price charged to ""competing purchasers"" was different; effect 
on consumers not considered); Morton Salt, 334 U.S. 37, 45-47, 49-50, 92 L. Ed. 1196, 68 S. Ct. 822 [] (section 2(a) ""was 
intended to justify a finding of injury to competition by a showing of 'injury to the competitor victimized by the 
discrimination'""; proof that ""the competitive opportunity of . . . merchants [was] injured"" shown by fact that disfavored 
purchasers ""had to pay [the seller] substantially more for their goods than their competitors had to pay""); Corn Prod. Ref. 
Co., 324 U.S. 726, 738-39, 89 L. Ed. 1320, 65 S. Ct. 961 [] (price differentials that divert business from one competitor to 
another create an effect that ""may be to substantially lessen competition.""); Hasbrouck v. Texaco, Inc., 842 F.2d 1034, 
1040 (9th Cir. 1988), cert. granted, 490 U.S. 1105 [] (1989) (injury of harm to competitors probative of injury to competition); 
Rose Confections, Inc. v. Ambrosia Chocolate Co., 816 F.2d 381, 385 (8th Cir. 1987) (harm to competition established by 
showing harm to competitors); Chrysler Credit Corp. v. J. Truett Payne Co., 670 F.2d 575, 580 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 
U.S. 908, 74 L. Ed. 2d 169, 103 S. Ct. 212 [] (1982) (to establish competitive injury under section 2 (a) a plaintiff ""must 
demonstrate that the likely effect of the alleged price discrimination was to allow a favored competitor to draw significant 
sales or profits away from him, the disfavored competitor""); Foremost Dairies, Inc. v. FTC, 348 F.2d 674, 678 (5th Cir.), 
cert. denied, 382 U.S. 959, 15 L. Ed. 2d 362, 86 S. Ct. 435 [] (1965) (recognizing that section 2 (a) protects injury to 
competition as well as injury to competitors). But see Boise Cascade, 837 F.2d at 1143 (harm to competition all that 
matters); Richard Short Oil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 799 F.2d 415, 420 (8th Cir. 1986) (RPA refers to competition in general, not 
competitors). This interpretation has carried over to primary-line price discrimination as well. See Utah Pie Co. v. 
Continental Baking Co., 386 U.S. 685, 18 L. Ed. 2d 406, 87 S. Ct. 1326 [] (1967) (local market price war driving down prices 
injured competitor, thus it injured competition); A.A. Poultry Farms, Inc. v. Rose Acre Farms, Inc., 881 F.2d 1396 (7th Cir. 
1989) (recognizing difference between law and economics); McGahee v. Northern Propane Gas Co., 858 F.2d 1487 (11th 
Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1084, 104 L. Ed. 2d 670, 109 S. Ct. 2110 [] (1989) (predatory intent to destroy 
competitor). But cf.  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, 106 S. Ct. 1348 [] 
(1986) (allegations conflicting with economic theory are to be viewed skeptically). The gist of these cases, representing 
about a half- century of [Robinson-Patman Act] interpretation, is that the legal focus of the competitive injury inquiry is on 
the competitor, not the consumer. For section 2 (a) purposes, whether or not output is restricted or prices are raised simply 
is not dispositive. We need not address this issue in any greater detail at this time. We address it at all only because the controversy over 
competitive injury may have implications for our later analysis of ""antitrust injury"" under Clayton Act section 4, 15 U.S.C. § 
16. For the time being we are satisfied merely to make it clear that when confronted with contemporary economic argument "
1499,," on the one hand and judicial precedent on the other, we feel, unlike those of a more activist bent, see, e.g., R. BORK, 
supra, at 36, that economic argument is not ultimately controlling; judicial precedent is. Subsequent to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals decision in Alan's of Atlanta, the Supreme Court decided Brooke Group Ltd. 
v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 224, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168, 113 S. Ct. 2578 (1993), in which the Court, 
swayed by the ""preconceived idea of crystalline purity"" (WITTGENSTEIN, PHILOSOPHICAL INVESTIGATIONS at § 108) 
embodied in prevailing economic haute couture, concluded that an injury to competition is ultimately nothing more than an 
idealized lower cost to consumers, regardless of whether such short-term lower costs result in actual, as opposed to theoretical, 
long-term lower costs or fewer beneficial products. Although stated in the context of a Robinson-Patman Act claim, the concept 
advanced was apparently made applicable to all antitrust claims. Under such a theory, the use of market power to prevent 
substitutes for tobacco products from reaching the market cannot be the basis of antitrust injury. However, the court does not 
rest its conclusion that no antitrust injury exists on this ground. Rather, the court concludes that the absence of an antitrust injury 
is due to the fact that Wynn cannot allege, as an individual, an antitrust injury particular to himself."
1499,18," I.e., the plaintiff has not alleged that he himself suffered a ""primary-line"" injury. Under Wynn's theory, an individual, to be a 
target of anti-competitive practices would have to be attempting to compete or competing in the market by selling healthy 
cigarettes."
1499,19," I.e., the plaintiff has not alleged that he suffered a ""secondary-line"" injury."
1499,20," The defendants seem to suggest that the plaintiff also asserts independent mail fraud claims under 18 U.S.C. § 1341 and wire 
fraud claims under 18 U.S.C. § 1343. However, the plaintiff's amended complaint fails to bear out this assertion. Rather than 
assert independent mail or wire fraud claims, the plaintiff incorporates these violations into his broad assertion of RICO violations 
which help make up his quo warranto claim. "
1500,21," The defendants contend that because there exists federal question jurisdiction over plaintiff's antitrust and RICO claims, the 
court has supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims of the plaintiff. Section 1367 of Title 28 states that a 
federal district court ""shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within 
[the court's] original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States 
Constitution."" However, as this court lacks original jurisdiction over the instant suit based upon federal question jurisdiction, it 
has no authority to assert jurisdiction over any related state law claims, to the extent that such exist at all. "
1501,22," In Lumbermen's Mutual Casualty Company v. Elbert, 348 U.S. 48, 50-51, 99 L. Ed. 59, 75 S. Ct. 151 (1954) (cited by the 
Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Broyles v. Bayless, 878 F.2d at 1402), the Supreme Court stated: Section 1332(a) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. s 1332(a), 28 U.S.C.A. s 1332(a), reads as follows: "
1502,," ""HN34[
] The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds 
the sum or value of $ 3,000 exclusive of interest and costs, and is between: ""(1) Citizens of different States * * *."" It is petitioner's contention that the 'matter in controversy' here is the underlying tort liability of the alleged wrongdoer. If this 
were true, of course, no diversity of citizenship would exist between respondent and Mrs. Bowen, as the real party-
defendant in interest. But the Louisiana courts have differentiated between actions brought by an injured party against the 
insurer alone and those brought against either the tortfeasor alone or together with the insurer. In the former action, the 
insurer is foreclosed from asserting defenses such as coverture, normally available to the tortfeasor.  Edwards v. Royalty 
Indemnity Co., 182 La. 171, 161 So. 191. Similarly, the insurer is severely restricted in advancing technical defenses based 
upon the terms of the policy, such as a failure of notice, when the injured party brings a direct action.  Jackson v. State 
Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., 211 La. 19, 29 So. 2d 177. While either type of action encompasses proof of the 
tortfeasor's negligence, in the separate suit against the insurer a plaintiff must also establish liability under the policy. The 
Louisiana courts have characterized the statute as creating a separate and distinct cause of action against the insurer 
which an injured party may elect in lieu of his action against the tortfeasor.  West v. Monroe Bakery, 217 La. 189, 46 So. 2d 
122; Jackson v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., supra."
1502,*," * * There is even greater justification for disregarding the tortfeasor's citizenship here than for disregarding the citizenship of a 
beneficiary since the insurer -- unlike a fiduciary -- has a direct financial interest in the outcome of this litigation."
1502,23," If a state could, through mere procedural decisions restrict the rights of access of parties to federal court, that state could, 
through its own action constrict the diversity jurisdiction of the federal court, which it is not permitted to do. A good example of 
this in a different context is Begay v. Kerr-McGee Corporation, 682 F.2d 1311 (9th Cir. 1982). In that case, the plaintiff Navajo 
miners working on uranium mines on a Navajo reservation brought an action against the defendant claiming that they were 
exposed to radiation in the course of their employment and as a consequence of the exposure suffered severe injuries. The 
district court dismissed the action on the grounds that because the state vested exclusive jurisdiction in the state workers' 
compensation commission, no subject matter jurisdiction remained with the court. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed 
with the district court on this issue, stating that while the requirement that the plaintiffs proceed under the state workers 
compensation laws may have deprived the plaintiffs of a substantive claim, it did not deprive the district court of subject matter 
jurisdiction. Id. at 1317. The district judge apparently concluded that because Arizona law would deprive an Arizona court of jurisdiction in a like 
case filed in state court, the federal court lacked diversity jurisdiction. Here, he erred. The question is whether the Indian"" 
complaint stated a claim for relief under Arizona law pursuant to Erie, rather than whether the district court lacked subject 
matter jurisdiction. See Black v. Payne, 591 F.2d 83, 86 n.1 (9th Cir. 1979) (federal question). HN35[
] Although the 
states have the power to prevent the federal court from granting relief in a diversity case by denying the substantive right of 
action asserted, they ""have no power to enlarge or contract the federal jurisdiction."" Markham v. City of Newport News, 292 
F.2d 711, 713 (4th Cir. 1961). See Railway Co. v. Whitton's Adm'r, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 270, 286, 20 L. Ed. 571 [] (1871); 
Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Lexington State Bank & Trust Co., 604 F.2d 1151, 1154-55 (8th Cir. 1979); Poitra v. DeMarrias, 
502 F.2d 23, 25-27 (8th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 934 [] (1975). ""State rules will not be applied 'to thwart the 
purposes of statutes of the United States.'"" Pankow Constr. Co. v. Advance Mortgage Corp., 618 F.2d 611, 613 (9th Cir. 
1980), quoting Sola Elec. Co. v. Jefferson Co., 317 U.S. 173, 176, 87 L. Ed. 165, 63 S. Ct. 172 [] (1942). Thus, state law 
may not control or limit the diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts. The district court's diversity jurisdiction is a creature of 
federal law under Article III and 28 U.S.C. § 1332 (a). Pursuant to the supremacy clause, section 1332(a) preempts any 
contrary state law. Nothing in Erie compels a different conclusion. ""The Erie doctrine does not extend to matters of 
jurisdiction or, generally, to matters of procedure. . . . Erie requires that the federal court grant or withhold relief as the state "
1503,," courts would. It does not require relegation of the diversity jurisdiction to the mercies of the legislatures of fifty separate 
states."" Markham v. City of Newport News, supra, 292 F.2d at 718. Indeed, HN36[
] the Erie doctrine rests upon the premise that the jurisdiction of the federal diversity court is satisfied, and 
addresses only the question whether federal or state law provides the substantive rules of decision in the case. See Erie, 
supra, 304 U.S. at 74-77 []. Regardless of whether Erie primarily involves interpretation of the Constitution or the Rules of 
Decision Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1652, see P. BATOR, P. MISHKIN, D. SHAPIRO & H. WECHSLER, HART & WECHSLER'S THE 
FEDERAL COURTS AND THE FEDERAL SYSTEM 706-08 (2d ed. 1973), it does not purport to permit state control of 
areas in which Congress has acted pursuant to its constitutional authority. See Erie, supra, 304 U.S. at 78 [] (""Except in 
matters governed by the Federal Constitution or by Acts of Congress, the law to be applied in any case is the law of the 
State.""). Nothing in Erie, its progeny, or the principles of federalism supporting the doctrine suggests that a state statute 
may operate to divest a federal court of the jurisdiction conferred by 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a). Only Congress, by repealing 
section 1332, has the constitutional authority to abolish or limit the district court's jurisdiction to hear all cases and 
controversies between citizens of different states which involve the requisite amount in controversy."
1503,682, F.2d at 1315-16. 
1504,24," And Alabama statutory law, as evidenced by Alabama Code § 6-6-595, which states, ""HN39[
] Whenever an action is 
commenced under the provisions of this article on the information of any person, his name must be joined as a plaintiff with the 
state."""
1504,25," The plaintiff has apparently made himself individually a party to the action, although, again, clarification of the style of this case 
by the plaintiff might clear up this little confusion. (This court, were it to retain jurisdiction over the instant action, would have 
crafted the prior statement in more imperative terms.) "
1505,26," In the same way in which later plaintiffs seeking punitive damages under Alabama law cannot be said to have an aggregate 
matter in controversy permitting removal to federal court on the basis of an earlier punitive damages award for the same or 
similar actions, even though if those later plaintiffs had been parties to the original action their claims could have been removed 
to federal court because the punitive relief was aggregable, because the State is not a party here, any aggregate award it might 
receive in a future action cannot be attributed back to Wynn's quo warranto suit."
1505,27," Arguably, the case is like one in which a plaintiff seeks prospective injunctive relief that would prevent a defendant in engaging 
in future conduct similar to that suffered by the plaintiff. However, Wynn can only pursue this action in his own name; the State is 
not a potential party to this action. At best, the State could only sue to prevent a defendant from selling products in the state 
without a certificate of authority subsequent to the revocation of that certificate. See Glover v. Midland Mortgage Co. of 
Oklahoma, Inc., 228 B.R. at 312 (stating that ""if an injunction was issued, future suits arising under the injunction would provide 
a common and undivided right of relief; but at present, each prospective plaintiffs right for relief is his or her own""). "
1508,1," On April 27, 1999, the court convened a telephonic conference in chambers to hear arguments on the motion to compel. 
Counsel for the parties as well as numerous foreign competitors were present and are fully aware of the facts surrounding this 
discovery dispute."
1508,2," The parties previously stipulated that the relevant market for purposes of calculating the § 3571(d) fine was dry lysine sold 
within the United States during the scope of the conspiracy. "
1516,1," Defendants filed counterclaims for violation of the Federal Communications Act, violation of the Telecommunications Act, 
antitrust violations, tortious interference with contract, intentional interference with prospective advantage and prospective 
contractual relations. "
1517,2," Because these two counts are substantially similar, the Court will consider them together."
1517,3," Section 202(a) of the Federal Communications Act provides in pertinent part: It shall be unlawful for any common carrier to make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges, practices, 
classifications, regulations, facilities, or services for or in connection with like communication service, directly or indirectly, 
by any means or device, or to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, 
class of persons, or locality, or to subject any particular person, class of persons, or locality to any undue or unreasonable 
prejudice or disadvantage."
1517,47, U.S.C. § 202(a) (1991).
1517,4," Section 230(c)(2) provides in full: No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of- (A) any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user 
considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or 
not such material is constitutionally protected; or (B) any action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the technical means to 
restrict access to material described in paragraph (1)."
1517,47, U.S.C. § 230(c)(2) (Supp. 1998). 
1518,5," The Court also notes that even if AOL were subject to the anti-discrimination provisions, it is not clear that Defendants could 
prevail on a discrimination claim where they have not shown that AOL treats other entities that transmit UBE any differently than 
it treated Defendants. "
1521,6," It is important to note that Defendants cannot claim harm as a competitor of AOL because Defendants do not compete in the 
same market as AOL. Defendants are advertisers and sellers of computer equipment whereas AOL sells information services. "
1522,7," There is no evidence that AOL prohibited Defendants from participating in the normal application process for businesses that 
want to advertise on AOL's network. Defendants did not apply; instead, they advertised through UBE then offered to pay AOL 
after being caught. "
1523,8," See Cyber Promotions, Inc., 948 F. Supp. at 459 (""No single entity-academic, corporate, governmental, or non-profit-
administers the Internet. It exists and functions as a result of the fact that hundreds of thousands of separate operators of 
computers and computer networks independently decided to use common data transfer protocol to exchange communications 
and information with other computers (which in turn exchange communications and information with still other computers).""). "
1524,9," AOL contends it did not deny Defendants access to AOL subscribers. AOL submits that Martindale can advertise to AOL 
subscribers, after applying for the right and paying the required fee. On a motion to dismiss, the Court must accept the pleadings 
as true, so the Court accepts Martindale's averment that AOL has prevented Martindale from transmitting commercial electronic 
messages to AOL subscribers. "
1525,10," Martindale contends that the Court should rely on Perk for the elements of tortious interference with contract as opposed to 
tortious interference with contract expectancy as stated in Maximus. In Perk, the Virginia Supreme Court listed four elements of 
tortious interference with contract.  485 S.E.2d at 143. Because the court did not incorporate ""improper means"" as an element, 
Martindale seems to imply that improper means is not relevant. However, the Perk Court also stated that in order to present a 
prima facie case of tortious interference, the plaintiff must allege and prove that the defendant employed improper methods. Id. 
Thus, the elements are the same for both causes of action. "
1535,1," Plaintiffs also bring state law claims for violations of Section 4 of the New Jersey Antitrust Act for Unlawful Attempt to 
Monopolize and Unlawful Monopolization (Counts IV and V) and for Tortious Refusal to Deal under the common law of 
Pennsylvania and New Jersey (Counts VI and VII)."
1535,2," Plaintiffs maintain that PNI, as the parent corporation of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Apartment Solutions, is a competitor of 
Apartment Source in the ALS market. "
1536,3," The term ""apartment community"" refers to an apartment building or series of apartment buildings that are operated by one 
owner and offer a variety of different facilities. (4/5/99 N.T. at 29.) "
1543,4," The allegations from the Complaint, which are set forth in PP 9.4.1 and 9.4.2 above, constitute judicial admissions and as such 
cannot be contradicted at trial.  Conte Brothers Automotive, Inc. v. Quaker State-Slick 50, Inc., 165 F.3d 221, 235 (3d Cir. 1998). "
1553,5," While Pastore uses the concept of submarket, the later-decided case of Allen-Myland v. IBM Corp., 33 F.3d 194 (3d Cir. 1994), 
questions the efficacy of a submarket in a product market analysis.  Id. at 208 n.16 (""The use of the term 'submarket' is 
somewhat confusing, and tends to obscure the true inquiry: whether IBM is constrained by the prices of large-scale mainframe 
computers when pricing its upgrades. If it is so constrained, then the relevant market consists of both mainframes and upgrades. 
If not, then it is simpler and more accurate to say that the relevant market itself, not some submarket of it, contains only 
upgrades.""). Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has recognized the possibility that within a broader product market ""well-defined 
submarkets may exist which, in themselves, constitute product markets for antitrust purposes."" Brown Shoe Co. v. United 
States, 370 U.S. at 325, 82 S. Ct. at 1524. "
1554,6," This case involves a unilateral refusal to deal. See Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 770, 104 S. 
Ct. 2731, 2741, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984)(internally coordinated conduct of a corporation and its divisions is judged as the conduct 
of a single actor and does not constitute group conduct subject to antitrust analysis). "
1555,7," HN21[
] A court has discretion to examine other factors beyond market share in assessing monopoly power. Yeager's Fuel,"
1555,953," F. Supp. at 651. Although it is not necessary to examine other market characteristics in light of the low market share held by 
Defendants, the Court notes that such an examination provides additional evidence that Defendants do not have monopoly 
power in the relevant market. For example, the evidence demonstrates that the barriers to enter the relevant market are 
insignificant or nonexistent.  Advo, Inc. v. Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc., 51 F.3d 1191, 1200-1202 (3d Cir. 1995) New guide 
books have recently entered the ""means to find renters"" market. In addition, there is nothing to stop established real estate 
agencies from entering this market. Moreover, as proven by Apartment Source and Apartment Solutions, the financial resources 
needed to start a locator service are relatively modest, and therefore, new locators can easily enter the market as well. "
1556,8," Plaintiffs do not challenge PNI's right to give its subsidiary reduced-cost and free advertising in The Inquirer and The Daily 
News. "
1570,1," The advisory opinions, which substantially mirror parts of the California Business and Professions Code, see Cal. Bus. & Prof. 
Code Ann. §§ 651, 1680 (West 1999), include the following propositions: ""A statement or claim is false or misleading in any material respect when it: ""a. contains a misrepresentation of fact; ""b. is likely to mislead or deceive because in context it makes only a partial disclosure of relevant facts; ""c. is intended or is likely to create false or unjustified expectations of favorable results and/or costs; ""d. relates to fees for specific types of services without fully and specifically disclosing all variables and other relevant factors; ""e. contains other representations or implications that in reasonable probability will cause an ordinarily prudent person to 
misunderstand or be deceived. ""Any communication or advertisement which refers to the cost of dental services shall be exact, without omissions, and shall 
make each service clearly identifiable, without the use of such phrases as 'as low as,' 'and up,' 'lowest prices,' or words or 
phrases of similar import. ""Any advertisement which refers to the cost of dental services and uses words of comparison or relativity -- for example, 'low 
fees' -- must be based on verifiable data substantiating the comparison or statement of relativity. The burden shall be on the 
dentist who advertises in such terms to establish the accuracy of the comparison or statement of relativity."" ""Advertising claims as to the quality of services are not susceptible to measurement or verification; accordingly, such claims are 
likely to be false or misleading in any material respect."" 128 F.3d 720, 723-724 (CA9 1997) (some internal quotation marks 
omitted)."
1570,2," The disclosures include: ""1. The dollar amount of the nondiscounted fee for the service[.] ""2. Either the dollar amount of the discount fee or the percentage of the discount for the specific service[.] ""3. The length of time that the discount will be offered[.] ""4. Verifiable fees[.] ""5. [The identity of] specific groups who qualify for the discount or any other terms and conditions or restrictions for qualifying for 
the discount."" Id. at 724."

] [4B] The FTC Act's prohibition of unfair competition and deceptive acts or practices, 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(1), overlaps the scope of § 1 
of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, aimed at prohibiting restraint of trade, FTC v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 
454-455, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445, 106 S. Ct. 2009 (1986), and the Commission relied upon Sherman Act law in adjudicating this case, 
In re California Dental Assn., 121 F.T.C. 190, 292, n. 5 (1996). "
1572,4," Compare In re American Medical Assn., 94 F.T.C. 701, 983-984, aff'd, 638 F.2d 443 (CA2 1980), aff'd by an equally divided 
Court, 455 U.S. 676, 102 S. Ct. 1744, 71 L. Ed. 2d 546 (per curiam) (1982), FTC v. National Comm'n on Egg Nutrition, 517 F.2d 
485, 487-488 (CA7 1975), with Community Blood Bank v. FTC, 405 F.2d 1011, 1017 (CA8 1969)."
1572,5," Cf.  Bogan v. Hodgkins, 166 F.3d 509, 514 & n.6 (CA2 1999); United States v. Brown University, 5 F.3d 658, 669 (CA3 1993);

594-595 (CA1 1993). "
1573,6," LEdHN[6B][
] [6B] This conclusion is consistent with holdings by a number of Courts of Appeals. In FTC v. National Comm'n on Egg Nutrition, 
supra, the Court of Appeals held that a nonprofit association ""organized for the profit of the egg industry,"" 517 F.2d at 488, fell 
within the Commission's jurisdiction. In American Medical Assn. v. FTC, supra, the Court of Appeals held that the ""business 
aspects,"" 517 F.2d at 448, of the AMA's activities brought it within the Commission's reach. These cases are consistent with our 
conclusion that an entity organized to carry on activities that will confer greater than de minimis or presumed economic benefits 
on profit-seeking members certainly falls within the Commission's jurisdiction. In Community Blood Bank v. FTC, supra, the 
Court of Appeals addressed the question whether the Commission had jurisdiction over a blood bank and an association of 
hospitals. It held that ""the question of the jurisdiction over the corporations or other associations involved should be determined 
on an ad hoc basis,"" 134 F.3d at 1018, and that the Commission's jurisdiction extended to ""any legal entity without shares of 
capital which engages in business for profit within the traditional meaning of that language,"" ibid. (emphasis deleted). The Court 
of Appeals also said that ""according to a generally accepted definition 'profit' means gain from business or investment over and 
above expenditures, or gain made on business or investment where both receipts or payments are taken into account,"" 134 F.3d 
at 1017, although in the same breath it noted that the term's ""meaning must be derived from the context in which it is used,"" 134 
F.3d at 1016. Our decision here is fully consistent with Community Blood Bank, because the CDA contributes to the profits of at 
least some of its members, even on a restrictive definition of profit as gain above expenditures. (It should go without saying that 
the FTC Act does not require for Commission jurisdiction that members of an entity turn a profit on their membership, but only 
that the entity be organized to carry on business for members' profit.) Nonetheless, we do not, and indeed, on the facts here, 
could not, decide today whether the Commission has jurisdiction over nonprofit organizations that do not confer profit on for-
profit members but do, for example, show annual income surpluses, engage in significant commerce, or compete in relevant 
markets with for-profit players. We therefore do not foreclose the possibility that various paradigms of profit might fall within the 
ambit of the FTC Act. Nor do we decide whether a purpose of contributing to profit only in a presumed sense, as by enhancing 
professional educational efforts, would implicate the Commission's jurisdiction."
1573,7," A letter from Bureau of Corporations Commissioner Joseph E. Davies to Senator Francis G. Newlands, the bill's sponsor and a 
member of the Conference Committee, written August 8, 1914, before the Conference Committee revisions, included a 
memorandum dated August 7, 1914, that expressed concern that the versions of the bill passed by the House and the Senate "
1574,," would not extend jurisdiction to purportedly nonprofit organizations, which might ""furnish convenient vehicles for common 
understandings looking to the limitation of output and the fixing of prices contrary to law."" Trade Commission Bill: Letter from the

1574,8," LEdHN[7B][

substantial evidence on the record, or whether it must remand to the Commission for a more extensive rule-of-reason analysis 
on the basis of an enhanced record. "
1575,9," LEdHN[10B][
] [10B] That false or misleading advertising has an anticompetitive effect, as that term is customarily used, has been long established. 
Cf.  FTC v. Algoma Lumber Co., 291 U.S. 67, 79-80, 78 L. Ed. 655, 54 S. Ct. 315 (1934) (finding a false advertisement to be 
unfair competition)."
1575,10," LEdHN[11B][
] [11B] HN8[
] ""The fact that a restraint operates upon a profession as distinguished from a business is, of course, relevant in 
determining whether that particular restraint violates the Sherman Act. It would be unrealistic to view the practice of professions 
as interchangeable with other business activities, and automatically to apply to the professions antitrust concepts which 
originated in other areas. The public service aspect, and other features of the professions, may require that a particular practice, 
which could properly be viewed as a violation of the Sherman Act in another context, be treated differently."" Goldfarb v. Virginia 
State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 788-789, n. 17, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572, 95 S. Ct. 2004 (1975). "
1576,11," JUSTICE BREYER claims that ""the Court of Appeals did consider the relevant differences."" Post, at 10. But the language he 
cites says nothing more than that per se analysis is inappropriate here and that ""some caution"" was appropriate where 
restrictions purported to restrict false advertising, see 128 F.3d at 726-727. Caution was of course appropriate, but this 
statement by the Court of Appeals does not constitute a consideration of the possible differences between these and other 
advertising restrictions."
1576,12," LEdHN[12B][
] [12B] JUSTICE BREYER suggests that our analysis is ""of limited relevance,"" post, at 12, because ""the basic question is whether this . 
. . theoretically redeeming virtue in fact offsets the restrictions' anticompetitive effects in this case,"" ibid. He thinks that the 
Commission and the Court of Appeals ""adequately answered that question,"" ibid. but the absence of any empirical evidence on 
this point indicates that the question was not answered, merely avoided by implicit burden-shifting of the kind accepted by 
JUSTICE BREYER. The point is that before a theoretical claim of anticompetitive effects can justify shifting to a defendant the 
burden to show empirical evidence of procompetitive effects, as quick-look analysis in effect requires, there must be some 
indication that the court making the decision has properly identified the theoretical basis for the anticompetitive effects and 
considered whether the effects actually are anticompetitive. Where, as here, the circumstances of the restriction are somewhat 
complex, assumption alone will not do. "
1577,13," JUSTICE BREYER wonders if we ""mean this statement as an argument against the anticompetitive tendencies that flow from 
an agreement not to advertise service quality."" Post, at 11. But as the preceding sentence shows, we intend simply to question 
the logic of the Court of Appeals's suggestion that the restrictions are anticompetitive because they somehow ""affect output,"" 
128 F.3d at 728, presumably with the intent to raise prices by limiting supply while demand remains constant. We do not mean 
to deny that an agreement not to advertise service quality might have anticompetitive effects. We merely mean that, absent 
further analysis of the kind JUSTICE BREYER undertakes, it is not possible to conclude that the net effect of this particular 
restriction is anticompetitive. "
1578,14," The Commission said only that ""'mere puffing' deceives no one and has never been subject to regulation.'"" 121 F.T.C. at 318. 
The question here, of course, is not whether puffery may be subject to governmental regulation, but whether a professional 
organization may ban it."
1578,15," Other commentators have expressed similar views. See, e.g., Kolasky, Counterpoint: The Department of Justice's ""Stepwise"" 
Approach Imposes Too Heavy a Burden on Parties to Horizontal Agreements, Antitrust 41, 43 (Spring 1998) (""In applying the 
rule of reason, the courts, as with any balancing test, use a sliding scale to determine how much proof to require""); Piraino, 
Making Sense of the Rule of Reason: A New Standard for Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 47 Vand. L. Rev. 1753, 1771 (1994) 
(""Courts will have to undertake varying degrees of inquiry depending upon the type of restraint at issue. The legality of certain 
restraints will be easy to determine because their competitive effects are obvious. Other restrictions will require a more detailed "
1579,," analysis because their competitive impact is more ambiguous""). But see Klein, A ""Stepwise"" Approach for Analyzing Horizontal 
Agreements Will Provide a Much Needed Structure for Antitrust Review, Antitrust 41, 42 (Spring 1990) (examination of 
procompetitive justifications ""is by no means a full scrutiny of the proffered efficiency justification. It is, rather, a hard look at the 
justification to determine if it meets the defendant's burden of coming forward with -- but not establishing -- a valid efficiency 
justification""). "
1591,1," The Court directed LePage's to file a Statement of Claims in response to 3M's repeated representations that it could 
not understand the nature of LePage's antitrust claims against it. 3M's Motion for Summary Judgment is directed 
primarily to LePage's Statement of Claims and its supporting evidence, and the information in this section is taken 
from LePage's Statement of Claims. Before LePage's filed its Statement of Claims, the claims in the Amended 
Complaint were set out in this Court's Opinion on Defendant's Motion to Dismiss. See LePage's Inc. v. 3M, 1997 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 18501, No. 97-3983, 1997 WL 734005 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 14, 1997). LePage's later filed a Second Amended Complaint 
naming an additional Plaintiff, LePage's Management Company. The claims in the Second Amended Complaint are not 
materially different from those in the Amended Complaint. "
1592,2," Plaintiff is authorized to bring this suit by Section 4 of the Clayton Act, which provides: "". . . Any person who shall be injured in 
his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the United 
States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, 
and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."" 14 
U.S.C.A. § 14 (West 1997)."
1592,3," It is not always clear which conduct LePage's claims violates which section of the antitrust statutes; however, if the evidence it 
presents with respect to any alleged conduct satisfies the summary judgment standard with respect to any section at issue in 
this case, the claim under that section will go forward. "
1593,4," As this Court stated in writing on the Motion to Dismiss in this case, § 3 of the Clayton Act applies to a narrower range of 
transactions than does § 1 of the Sherman Act. Section 3 includes goods or commodities but not real property, advertising, or 
services. However, both require agreements or understandings between the defendant and others, and for purposes of this 
Motion, the differences between § 1 and § 3 are not material. "
1594,5," As evidence for this figure, LePage's cites to a report on 3M's Commercial Office Supply Division. The Court assumes that the 
figure applies to repositionable notes in general. (Pl.'s St. Claims Ex. 34.)"
1594,6," Other rebate programs were designed to shift customers from 3M's own second tier or private label products to its more 
profitable primary branded products. For example, the Brand Enhancement program offered purchasers of Scotch tape rebates 
on purchases of ""Post-Its."" (Pl.'s St. Claims Ex. 34.) "
1595,7," It is not clear that LePage's could have met 3M's total discount by reducing the price of its private label tape by 18%. It appears 
that 3M was offering an 18% discount on the total volume of all products 3M sole to Fay's Drug, not just transparent tape. The 
total dollar amount of 3M's sales may have resulted in a dollar amount rebate higher than 18% of LePage's sales to Fay's Drug."
1595,8," The assumption here is that LePage's approaches 3M's level of efficiency as a competitor. In SmithKline Corp. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 
427 F. Supp. 1089, 1128 (E.D. Pa. 1976), the district court stated that ""the foul is committed here by reason of the package 
scheme's interrelationship with the significant barriers to entry [into the market] which permits Lilly to maximize its dominance 
and simultaneously drive a slightly less efficient competitor from the market."" 427 F. Supp. at 1128. "
1596,9," In addition, none of the companies in Brooke Group was a monopolist. Id. at 213, 113 S. Ct. at 2582-83. The defendant in that 
case never controlled more than 12% of the market at any time relevant to the dispute. A monopolist such as 3M may be held to 
a different standard in evaluating anticompetitive conduct. See Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc., 504 U.S. 
451, 488, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 2093, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (stating that ""where a defendant maintains 
substantial market power, his activities are examined through a special lens: Behavior that might otherwise not be of concern to 
the antitrust laws -- or that might even be viewed as procompetitive -- can take on exclusionary connotations when practiced by 
a monopolist."") "
1598,10," Matsushita seemed to raise the possibility that there might be a special summary judgment standard for antitrust cases in 
general, or predatory pricing cases in particular. However, the Supreme Court later made clear in Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image 
Technical Serv's., Ind., 504 U.S. 451, 468-69, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 2083, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992), that there was no special 
standard. See also Advo v. Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc., 51 F.3d 1191, 1195 (3d Cir. 1995). "
1599,11," Some of 3M's customers were concerned that, if 3M's monopoly grew stronger, it would raise prices. Eckerd Drug Company, 
in discussing 3M's entry into the private label market, wondered whether, if it captured a monopoly position, it would use that 
position to drive up the prices. (Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. 86.) Woolworth noted that 3M had always been a high priced supplier and feared 
that 3M would raise prices further if it obtained all of Woolworth's business. (Pl.'s St. Claims Ex. 85) "
1609,1," This court will occasionally reference the exhibits attached to an affidavit submitted by William R. Golden, Jr. (""Golden Aff.""). 
The Golden affidavit was not submitted in connection with this motion but was presented to the court in the context of a prior 
motion in this case. As no party disputes the contents of the documents attached to the Golden affidavit, and the substance of 
the documents are continually referenced in the complaint, this court will at times refer to these documents in order to more 
clearly explain the facts of an otherwise factually complex case. "
1613,2," Price fixing, boycotts, horizontal market divisions, and certain tying arrangements have been found to be per se violations of 
the Sherman Act. See Mylan Laboratories, Inc. v. Akzo, N.V., 770 F. Supp. 1053, 1061 n. 5 (D. Md. 1991)"
1613,3," HN4[
]  15 U.S.C. § 2 provides in part: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine with any other person or persons, to monopolize 
any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations shall be deemed guilty of a felony. "
1614,4," An effect on interstate commerce must also be shown to maintain either a Section 1 or Section 2 claim, see Fuentes, 946 F.2d 
at 198, but the parties do not dispute that this element has been satisfied. "
1618,5," It is interesting to note that, according to Biovail, the FTC is currently investigating the Andrx Agreement. See Pl. Opp. Br. at 15 
n. 25. "
1619,6," Although defendants' moving brief seems to treat the allegations regarding the HPB approval process only in the context of a 
breach of contract claim, defendants apparently realize that these allegations are also asserted with respect to Biovail's antitrust "
1620,," claims, see Pl. Opp. Br. at 22, as their reply brief argues that the allegations are ""simply insufficient to support either a breach of 
contract or antitrust claim."" Defs. Reply Br. at 8. "
1621,7," As stated previously, Biovail also alleges that ""similar bogus concerns were voiced by the sales representatives of defendant 
Hoechst-USA in the United States."" Compl. P 54. As defendants have not addressed this contention, this court will assume that 
they do not challenge it as support for Biovail's antitrust claims. See National Assoc. of Pharmaceutical Mfrs., Inc. v. Ayerst 
Labs., 850 F.2d 904, 916-17 (2d Cir. 1988)(holding that manufacturer of brand name products sending letter to pharmacists 
which contained false and disparaging comments about generic brand products could support a Section 2 claim). "
1624,8," The Settlement Agreement expressly provides that it is governed by New Jersey law. See Spears Decl., Exh. C P 12. "
1625,9," In its brief, but not its complaint, Biovail asserts for the first time that, even if the conduct of the contract defendants did not 
violate the express terms of the agreement, the conduct constitutes a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair 
dealing which inheres in every contract. See Pl. Opp. Br. at 44-46. This court need not now address this claim because ""it is 
axiomatic that the complaint may not be amended by the briefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss."" Pennsylvania ex rel. 
Zimmerman v. Pepsico, Inc., 836 F.2d 173, 181 (3d Cir. 1988) (quoting Car Carriers, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 745 F.2d 1101, 
1107 (7th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1054, 84 L. Ed. 2d 821, 105 S. Ct. 1758 (1985))."
1625,10," The complaint alleges that defendants' conduct constitutes unfair competition under the common law of New Jersey and ""the 
other States of the Union."" Compl. P 112. Defendants quarrel with the vagueness of this claim because no state beyond New 
Jersey is specified. See Defs. Br. at 31 n.34. It is not uncommon, however, for state common law claims to be pleaded without 
reference to which law will ultimately govern the claim. "
1645,1," Indirect purchasers ""are not the immediate buyers from the alleged antitrust violators,"" but are those who buy goods through an 
intermediary such as a retailer or wholesaler.  Kansas v. Utilicorp United, Inc., 497 U.S. 199, 207, 110 S. Ct. 2807, 2812, 111 L. 
Ed. 2d 169 (1990). "
1646,2," Section 4 of the Clayton Act, HN2[
]  15 U.S.C. § 15 (1997), states in part: Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue 
therefor in any district court of the United States . . . and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the 
cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."
1646,3," See United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U.S. 218, 67 S. Ct. 1560, 91 L. Ed. 2010 (1947)."
1646,4," Louisiana Power, 493 So. 2d at 1152 (quoting Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 4, 78 S. Ct. 514, 517, 2 L. 
Ed. 2d 545 (1958))."
1646,5," In State ex rel. Ieyoub v. Borden, Inc., 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1921, 1995 WL 59548 (E.D. La. Feb. 10, 1995), the federal 
district court noted, while discussing an issue of diversity jurisdiction, the absence of Louisiana caselaw interpreting whether § 
137 provides a remedy for indirect purchasers. The decision contains no holding on the issue before us. "
1647,6," As appellees correctly describe the non-Illinois Brick position: ""To recover damages, every member of the [Frees'] putative 
class would have to prove not only the magnitude of the alleged overcharge in wholesale prices at the time they bought infant 
formula, but the retail prices paid and the proportion of the alleged wholesale overcharge passed on to consumers through those 
retail prices."" Appellees' brief at 32."
1647,7," See Blewett v. Abbott Lab., Inc., 86 Wash. App. 782, 938 P.2d 842, 845-46 (Wash. Ct. App. 1997); Mack v. Bristol-Myers 
Squibb Co., 673 So. 2d 100, 108, (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1996); Stifflear v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 931 P.2d 471, 475-76 (Colo. 
Ct. App. 1996). But see Hyde v. Abbott Lab., Inc., 123 N.C. App. 572, 473 S.E.2d 680, 685-86 (N.C. Ct. App. 1996) Several 
states have statutorily overruled Illinois Brick's indirect purchaser rule, allowing any person to sue for antitrust violations whether 
injured ""directly or indirectly."" See, e.g., Minn. Stat. § 325D.57 (1994) (recognized in Minnesota ex rel. Humphrey v. Philip 
Morris, Inc., 551 N.W.2d 490 (Minn. 1996)); Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 16750(a) (West 1997) (recognized in Cellular Plus, Inc. v. 
Superior Court, 14 Cal. App. 4th 1224, 18 Cal. Rptr. 2d 308 (Cal. Ct. App. 1993)). Other states have taken the opposite 
approach and statutorily denied standing to indirect purchasers. See, e.g., 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 10/7(2) (West 1994) "
1648,," (recognized in Gaebler v. New Mexico Potash Corp., 285 Ill. App. 3d 542, 676 N.E.2d 228, 230, 221 Ill. Dec. 707 (Ill. App. Ct. 
1997) (permitting only the state attorney general to bring indirect purchaser suits)). "
1656,1," General Statutes 42-110g provides, in pertinent part: ""Any person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real 
or personal, as a result of the use or employment of a method, act or practice prohibited by section 42-110b, may bring an action 
. . . to recover actual damages . . ."" (Emphasis added.) "
1660,2," The court, Melville, J., granted the defendants' motion for reconsideration, L'Altrella v. Weight Watchers International, 1998 
Conn. Super. LEXIS 2602, Superior Court, judicial district of Fairfield at Bridgeport, Docket No. 334348 (September 14, 1998) 
(Melville, J.), but did not grant the defendants' request for relief, and did not disturb its prior decision on the motion to strike."
1660,3," Anderson, Ballentine's Law Dictionary (3rd Ed. 1969), defines fraud as ""deceit, deception, artifice, or trickery operating 
prejudicially on the rights of another, and so intended, by inducing him to part with property or surrender some legal right . . ."" "
1661,4," Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) provides in pertinent part: ""Every defense, in law or fact, to a claim for relief in any pleading, whether a 
claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, shall be asserted in the responsive pleading thereto if one is required, 
except that the following defenses may at the option of the pleader be made by motion: . . . (6) failure to state a claim upon 
which relief can be granted . . ."" "
