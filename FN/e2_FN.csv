24,1, All other issues raised by Sylvania's appeal are disposed of in a memorandum disposition filed herewith. 
25,2," HN3[
] Secondary-line price discrimination affects competition between buyers of a discriminating seller's goods, while 
primary-line discrimination affects competition between a discriminating seller and others who sell the same goods. "
27,3," Several other circuits have addressed this issue, though without the same depth of analysis found in Boise and Feeser. 
Compare Alan's of Atlanta, Inc. v. Minolta Corp., 903 F.2d 1414, 1418 n.6, 1426 (11th Cir. 1990) (Robinson-Patman Act focuses 
on injury to competitors, not to competition), with Richard Short Oil Co., Inc. v. Texaco, Inc., 799 F.2d 415, 420 (8th Cir. 1986) 
(alternative holding) (Robinson-Patman Act focuses on injury to competition, not to competitors), and Motive Parts Warehouse v. 
Facet Enterprises, 774 F.2d 380, 395 (10th Cir. 1985) (same)."
27,4," Foremost Pro was later cited with approval by the D.C. Circuit in Boise, 837 F.2d at 1143. "
35,1, The proposed Subclass was limited to persons to whom the Defendants send periodic mailings. 
38,2," One type of riskless trades -- those conducted through Instinet -- has already been excluded from the class by agreement of 
the parties. "
45,1," The within case has been referred to the undersigned United States magistrate judge for all purposes, including trial and entry 
of judgment, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c). "
49,2," The question of the requirements of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 2, was not raised in the Hannon case. State laws 
which prohibit the enforcement of agreements to arbitrate violate the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution 
because of the Federal Arbitration Act unless the agreement falls within the ""two limitations"" to the Act.  Southland Corporation 
v. Keating, 465 U.S. 1, 10-16, 79 L. Ed. 2d 1, 104 S. Ct. 852 (1984); Mitsubishi Motors Corporation v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, 
Inc., 723 F.2d 155, 158 (1 Cir., 1983). Neither of the limitations is applicable to either the instant case or the Hannon case. The 
result is the same regardless of whether the claim which is the subject of an arbitration agreement has been brought in federal or 
state court. Id.; Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24, 74 L. Ed. 2d 765, 103 S. Ct. 
927 (1983). Whether a Chapter 93B claim falls within the principle that antitrust claims are not subject to arbitration is discussed, 
infra, at part III."
49,3," See footnote 2, supra. "
50,4," The Court wrote that: ""we find it unnecessary to assess the legitimacy of the American Safety doctrine as applied to 
agreements to arbitrate arising from domestic disputes."" Mitsubishi Motors Corp., 473 U.S. at 629. "
60,1," Although VVL speculates in its memoranda that the offer was a sham, its complaint contains no such allegation. "
61,2, The Magistrate requested VVL to amend its complaint to clarify the basis upon which HGSI could be held liable.
61,3," Of course, a request for attorney's fees and costs follows."
61,4," In VVL's previous complaints, Counts II and III named HGSI as a defendant."
61,5," The Magistrate reasoned that because VVL had no reasonable expectation of acquiring Grace's vermiculite holdings all claims 
under the Sherman Antitrust Act should be dismissed. Also, the Magistrate found that VVL's complaint failed adequately to plead 
the necessary elements to support its claims. The separate conspiracy to monopolize count was not contained in VVL's previous 
complaints. "
62,6, HGSI is not a defendant in the Peers cases. 
63,7," The Supreme Court has carved out various exceptions. See, e.g., United Mine Workers of America v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 
657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585 (1965) (holding that the Act does not cover attempts to influence executive to adopt labor 
standards); Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, 365 U.S. 127, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523 (1961) 
(holding that using false information to persuade state governmental actors to enact legislation that injures competitors is not 
actionable under the Act); Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 508 U.S. 49, 123 L. Ed. 
2d 611, 113 S. Ct. 1920 (1993) (holding that unless objectively baseless, litigation is protected under the Noerr-Pennington 
Doctrine, which protects right to petition government); Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 87 L. Ed. 315, 63 S. Ct. 307 (1943) 
(holding state action exempt from purview of the Act); NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1215, 102 
S. Ct. 3409 (1981) (holding that consumer boycott of businesses organized by blacks to achieve racial equality could not be "
64,," reached by state antitrust laws); Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 484, 84 L. Ed. 1311, 60 S. Ct. 982 (1940) (holding 
that violent union take over of factory did not implicate antitrust laws)."
64,8," See William N. Eskridge, Jr., The New Textualism, 37 UCLA L. Rev. 621 (1990) (outlining Justice Scalia's theory of statutory 
interpretation)."
64,9," Professor Elhauge, of counsel to VVL in this case, argues that the Sherman Antitrust Act was not intended to govern financially 
disinterested restraints that are not commercial in nature. The Scope of Antitrust Process, 104 Harv. L. Rev. 668, 738-46 (1991)."
64,10," Included among the practices viewed by the Supreme Court as most dangerous are the following: horizontal and vertical price-
fixing, certain tying arrangements, group boycotts or concerted refusals to deal, and horizontal market divisions. See 2 Julian 
Von Kalinowski, Antitrust Laws & Trade Regulation § 6.02[1] (1984); see also Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 497, 
84 L. Ed. 1311, 60 S. Ct. 982 (1940) (citing practices)."
64,11," Although it is beyond cavil that nonprofit organizations are subject to federal antitrust laws, see American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers, Inc. v. Hydrolevel Corp., 456 U.S. 556, 576, 72 L. Ed. 2d 330, 102 S. Ct. 1935 (1982), the Supreme 
Court has flinched, if only in dictum, at the prospect of exposing nonprofit organizations to the same liability faced by for-profit 
businesses. See Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 778-89 n.17, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572, 95 S. Ct. 2004 (1975); but see 
National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 696, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637, 98 S. Ct. 1355 (1978) 
(flinching from the flinch). "
66,12," By no means should this statement be taken to suggest that HGSI's conduct is morally comparable to the vicious acts of these 
groups. "
67,13," VVL abandoned, in its Second Amended Complaint, the claim that HGSI has market power in the vermiculite mining rights 
market."
67,14, See infra note 17.
67,15," VVL cites Allen v. Bradley Co. v. Union, 325 U.S. 797, 810, 89 L. Ed. 1939, 65 S. Ct. 1533 (1945), and United States v. 
Borden Co., 308 U.S. 188, 204-05, 84 L. Ed. 181, 60 S. Ct. 182 (1939), for the proposition that even if HGSI were entitled to an 
exemption from antitrust liability, its exemption would be forfeited because of its alleged conspiracy with Grace, its competitor. In "
68,," Borden and in Allen, however, there was no question that the defendants were engaging in commercial transactions. The 
agricultural producers in Borden received pecuniary benefit by entering into an agreement to extract supracompetitive prices for 
milk, and the labor unions in Allen conspired with other groups in order to win higher wages. In contrast, HGSI's primary 
objective is not to achieve pecuniary gain, and, consistent with its objective, HGSI's gain from its agreement is largely 
nonpecuniary."
68,16," Of course, what one can legally achieve unilaterally, one cannot necessarily achieve in concert with another under Section 1. 
See, e.g., Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 761, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775, 104 S. Ct. 1464 (1984). This 
principle, however, is not at issue here; rather, the issue is whether the identity of the alleged conspirator (in Scheidler, other 
anti-abortionists; in this case, Grace) is dispositive."
68,17," Although the Ninth Circuit's invocation of engagement and marriage seems far-fetched, some do not view romance as 
something far-removed from the business world. See Saul Levmore, Love it or Leave it: Property Rules, Liability Rules, and 
Exclusivity of Remedies in Partnership and Marriage, 58 Law & Contemp. Probs. 221, 228 (1995) (comparing ""the traditional 
[business] partnership rule"" to ""the law governing marriages,"" both of which ""promise[] liquidity by offering every participant the 
right to exit with the net value of that participant's share in the enterprise, but . . . [with] no other [available] remedy""); Saul 
Levmore, Irreversibility and the Law: The Size of Firms and Other Organizations, 18 J. Corp. Law 333, 356 (1993) (describing 
the problem of irreversibility--undesirable expansion that may be difficult to undo--in the corporate context and analogizing to the 
familial sphere, where the problem is the flip side of irreversibility, because ""in the family setting, 'agents' may have a propensity 
to quit, or contract selfishly, when things are difficult""). Perhaps the laws against polygamy should be characterized as government imposed rationing; whereas in the business world, 
the individual with the most money can purchase an amount of goods limited only by his preferences and his purchasing power, 
in the market for marriages, the individual with the most ""purchasing power,"" in terms of attractiveness and charisma, cannot 
""buy"" all that she is willing and able without running up against the law."
68,18," For a brilliant commentary, see David Foster Wallace, Infinite Jest 398-407 (1996). "
70,19," ""HN12[
] Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor, . . . and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained. . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 15(a)."
70,20," ""HN13[
] Any person . . . shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief . . . against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws. . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 26. "
71,21," The donation itself, stripped of any explicit or implicit understanding against mining, could not violate Section 1, because, 
absent the understanding between Grace and HGSI, there would be no concerted action alleged to have unreasonably 
restrained trade."
71,22," Because of this conclusion, the court need not reach the question whether the Peers (neither competitors nor consumers) 
have standing to pursue Section 1 claims against Grace. "
73,23," In its April 21, 1995 Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, VVL disavows any claim that its complaint alleges that 
Grace has violated Section 2 by monopolizing or attempting to monopolize the ""vermiculite mining rights market"" in Louisa 
County or South Carolina. Id. at 7 n.1. VVL alleges monopolization in the ""vermiculite concentrates market."" Id. Although this 
disavowal was made before VVL twice amended its complaint, nothing in its subsequent complaints indicates any intention to 
renounce this position. Therefore, the court confines its discussion to the United States vermiculite concentrates market."
73,24," From the allegations in the complaint, it can be deduced that VVL owns 20% of vermiculite mining rights in the United States, 
HGSI owns 40%, and Grace owns 40%. "
74,25," Because VVL's previous complaints alleged that Grace had 51% of the market, and the court had not granted VVL's motion to 
amend its complaint until the writing of this opinion, Grace has made arguments only with respect to the 51% figure. "
75,26," Although we are accustomed to thinking of donations as desirable acts of generosity to be encouraged, not all donations are 
so benign. See David Foster Wallace, Infinite Jest 398-407 (1996)."
75,27," NCEMC deals with the ""essential facilities doctrine,"" a doctrine by which a lawful monopolist might have a duty to deal with a 
rival if it controls a resource without which its rival cannot survive. VVL does not contend that the essential facilities doctrine 
comes into play in this case. See VVL's Objections of October 2, 1995, at 14-15. "
76,28," For a contrary view, see Herbert, Federal Antitrust Policy § 7.5 (1994). "
77,29," The court notes that, at least in the short term, it is not implausible to assume that VVL may benefit from a suppression in 
supply; a reduction in output resulting in a price increase will redound to the benefit of VVL, whose vermiculite will command 
higher prices. Were this the only ""injury"" that appeared possible from VVL's complaint, VVL would not be deemed to have 
suffered antitrust injury. "
81,30," The Peers rely on a Virginia state law decision (to which HGSI, but not Grace, was a party) holding that failure to mine, even in 
the face of a ""sole discretion"" clause, is subject to a duty of good faith. That court, however, did not have the benefit of Mahoney 
v. NationsBank of Virginia, 249 Va. 216, 455 S.E.2d 5 (1995), and Charles E. Brauer Co. v. NationsBank, 251 Va. 28, 466 
S.E.2d 382 (1996). "
93,1," Neither the original complaint nor the amended complaint specifically identified whether plaintiff was challenging defendants' 
successful efforts at lobbying the City and Count of Denver to pass Ordinance 863. However, because the amended complaint 
alleges defendants ""sought, and ultimately obtained, a city ordinance purporting to 'compel' them to charge"" the daily usage fee, 
appellant's append. at 6, we will assume for purposes of this appeal that plaintiff is challenging defendants' lobbying activities. "
100,1," HN2[
] Section 2 of the Sherman Act provides: ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with 
foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $ 
10,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any other person, $ 350,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding three years, or by both said 
punishments, in the discretion of the court."" 15 U.S.C. § 2. "
107,1," Defendants Zarco and Zarco & Associates have filed an additional motion to dismiss, as well as joining all defendants in the 
instant motion. In the separate motion, they argue that this court has no personal jurisdiction over them. Because they failed to 
present this claim in their first motion to dismiss, however, it is deemed waived. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(1); Harris Bank Naperville v. 
Pachaly, 902 F. Supp. 156, 157 (N.D.Ill. 1995). Nonetheless, all the claims made by plaintiffs against Zarco and Zarco & 
Associates are dismissed under the recommendations contained in this Report. "
116,1," See Paine Webber, Jackson & Curtis, Inc., v. Malon S. Ardus, Inc., 486 F. Supp. 1118 (S.D.N.Y. 1980) (stay denied where the 
defendants were under indictment); SEC v. First Jersey Securities, Inc., 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10157, 1987 WL 8655, *5 
(S.D.N.Y. 1987) (stay denied, stating ""the public has an interest in the prompt resolution of allegations against [the defendants]. .

civil action); Roe v. Operation Rescue, 710 F. Supp. 577 (E.D.Pa. 1988) (stay denied because it was uncertain how long the 
parallel criminal proceedings would last). See also Wehling v. CBS, 608 F.2d 1084, 1088-89 (5th Cir. 1979) (case stayed); Clark 
v. United States, 481 F. Supp. 1086, 1099-1100 (S.D.N.Y. 1979) (discovery stayed); Dienstag v. Bronsen, 49 F.R.D. 327 
(S.D.N.Y. 1970) (protective order granted, depositions stayed) "
117,2," ""The convenience of the courts is best served when motions to stay proceedings are discouraged."" Gala Enterprises, Inc. v. 
Hewlett Packard Company, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18867, 1996 WL 732636 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) citing United States v. Private 
Sanitation Indus., Ass'n, 811 F. Supp. 802, 808 (E.D.N.Y. 1992). "
122,*," Honorable Jane A. Restani, Judge, United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation. "
123,1," The PUC is an independent state administrative commission authorized to regulate public utility companies doing business in 
Pennsylvania. See 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. §§ 301, 501. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Code provides the PUC with broad 
authority to ""supervise and regulate"" public utilities doing business in Pennsylvania. Id. § 501(b). PUC regulations, like their 
FERC counterpart, require utilities to purchase energy from ""qualifying facilities."" 52 Pa. Code § 57.34."
123,2,"  When reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, we must accept as true 
the factual allegations in the complaint and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from them.  Fuentes v. South Hills 
Cardiology, 946 F.2d 196, 201 (3d Cir. 1991)."
123,3," SER asserts that it is both an independent power producer and a qualifying facility. We note, however, that an ""independent 
power producer"" is by definition ""an electric power supplier which is not a qualifying facility . . . ."" 52 Pa. Code § 57.31. This 
potential conflict is not relevant for the purposes of this appeal, however, and throughout this opinion we will refer to SER as 
both an independent power producer and a qualifying facility without deciding whether either designation is inappropriate."
123,4, PP&L is also required to (and does) purchase electric energy from independent power producers other than SER. 
124,5,"  HN1[
] We exercise plenary review over the district court's grant of PP&L's Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  Jeremy H. v. Mount Lebanon Sch. 
Dist., 95 F.3d 272, 277 (3d Cir. 1996). We apply the same standard as the district court; that is, we must ""refrain from granting a 
dismissal unless it is certain that no relief can be granted under any set of facts which could be proved."" Fuentes, 946 F.2d at 
201. "
125,6," SER also alleged a list of its damages, including the loss of electricity sales revenues, increased costs to purchase fuel oil and 
electricity, and accelerated depreciation of the plant through increased stress upon vital components attributable to excessive 
cycling. Amended Complaint, P 70. These allegations do not constitute antitrust injury. As the district court properly concluded, 
""such HN6[
] injuries to an individual competitor company, without allegations of injury to competition or consumer welfare, are 
insufficient as a matter of law to establish a violation of federal antitrust law."" Dist. Ct. Op., at 7, 1996 WL 284994, at *3 (E.D. 
Pa. May 21, 1996); see Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 488, 97 S. Ct. at 697. "
126,7,"  ""Utilities earn a return only on their property which is used and useful in producing and delivering power. The utilities earn no 
return on costs, such as those incurred to purchase fuel or power from other sources such as [qualifying facilities]."" Lehigh 
Valley Power Comm. v. Pennsylvania Pub. Util. Comm'n, 128 Pa. Commw. 259, 563 A.2d 548, 552 n.10 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 
1989)."
126,8," In Pennsylvania, the PUC has been entrusted with ""full power and authority . . . to enforce, execute and carry out, by its 
regulations, orders, or otherwise, . . . the provisions of [the Code] and the full intent thereof."" 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 501; see 
id. § 1301 (rates shall be ""just and reasonable""). SER's assertion that PP&L's curtailments allow it to ""unfairly and illegally skew the evidence, concerning the extent to which its 
capital equipment is utilized that it presents the PUC in support of rate requests, thereby misleading the PUC in its rate 
determinations,"" Appellant Brief, at 18-19, might also appropriately be grounds for a complaint before the PUC, but it is not a 
basis for an antitrust complaint. See 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 1311 (PUC may ascertain and fix fair value of public utility's 
property); id. §§ 505, 1302 (public utilities shall furnish information to PUC)"
126,9,"  In addition, while the environmental quality of energy sources may be a worthwhile concern, it does not appear to be a problem 
whose solution is found in the Sherman Act. See, e.g., In re Multidistrict Vehicle Air Pollution, 538 F.2d 231, 236 (9th Cir. 1976) 
(where ""the harm to be alleviated is environmental, not economic in the antitrust sense,"" court affirmed dismissal of antitrust 
suit); Conservation Council of W. Austl., Inc. v. Aluminum Co. of Am., 518 F. Supp. 270, 281 (W.D. Pa. 1981) (where plaintiff 
""attempts to raise environmental issues under the guise of antitrust laws,"" court dismissed plaintiff 's complaint for failure to state 
claim upon which relief can be granted); see also Gutierrez v. E. & J. Gallo Winery Co., Inc., 604 F.2d 645, 646 (9th Cir. 1979) 
(affirming dismissal of antitrust claims brought by farm workers complaining about work reduction; plaintiffs' goals were unrelated 
to purpose of antitrust laws); Marchwinski v. Oliver Tyrone Corp., 83 F.R.D. 606 (W.D. Pa. 1979) (dismissing antitrust claims that "
127,," sought to remedy gender discrimination); cf.  National Soc'y of Prof'l Eng'rs v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 693-95, 98 S. Ct. 
1355, 1366-67, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1978) (rejecting defendant's attempt to use safety and health to justify anticompetitive 
behavior). We do not decide that environmental quality can never be considered when conducting antitrust analysis. Rather, we conclude 
that when an antitrust defendant's conduct cannot be linked to antitrust injury, the fact that the conduct may be otherwise 
undesirable is not a concern of the antitrust laws. "
128,10," See also Greensboro Lumber Co. v. Georgia Power Co., 643 F. Supp. 1345, 1373 (N.D. Ga. 1986) (""In establishing PURPA, . 
. . Congress did not intend to place qualifying facilities in competition with public utilities. . . . Qualifying facilities are not 
authorized under PURPA to sell at retail . . . . They are not competitors of public utilities.""), aff'd, 844 F.2d 1538 (11th Cir. 1988)."
128,11," At oral argument, counsel for SER conceded that ""the first opportunity for customers to choose their electric generation 
suppliers is April 1st of this year . . . ."" Oral Arg. Trans. at 13."
128,12," At oral argument, counsel for SER conceded that ""it's true that we don't know exactly what the market will look like[following 
deregulation] . . . ."" Oral Arg. Trans. at 16."
128,13," We do not decide whether PP&L's generation curtailment policy would violate the Sherman Act in a competitive market where 
no agreement precluded competitive activity. That scenario, while it may arise at some point in the future, is not presently before 
us."
128,14," At oral argument, counsel for SER suggested that the relevant ""wholesale market"" includes sales to industrial consumers who 
attach transmission lines to SER's line. Oral Arg. Trans. at 25. We disagree. HN10[
] The ""sale of electric energy at wholesale"" is defined by statute as the ""sale of electric energy to any person for resale."" 16 U.S.C. § 824(d) (emphasis supplied). Industrial 
consumers who purchase electric energy for their own use (i.e., not for resale), are not wholesale customers; they are retail 
consumers. The relevant wholesale market in this case, as suggested in SER's Amended Complaint, is the sale of energy to 
PJM member companies and other power pools."
128,15," While the Amended Complaint clearly states that SER must sell its energy exclusively to PP&L, the Power Purchase 
Agreement itself is ambiguous and can be read to permit SER to sell energy to third parties once it provides 79.5 megawatts to "
129,," PP&L. Agreement, Art. 3. We rely on the plain language of the Amended Complaint in concluding that the Agreement precludes 
SER from competing with PP&L in the wholesale market. As we note in the text, however, even if the Agreement does not 
prevent SER from selling excess energy in the wholesale market: (1) SER may not compel other PJM member companies to 
accept energy directly from SER due to its failure to comply with 16 U.S.C. § 824a(b); and (2) as a matter of undisputed fact, 
SER must supply its energy exclusively to PP&L, cannot physically provide energy directly to other utilities, and has not 
attempted to secure voluntary interconnections with PJM member companies other than PP&L. We will not permit SER to 
amend its Amended Complaint to clarify its rights under the Agreement as such amendment would be futile. "
130,16," Kamine/Besicorp involved allegations that a public utility used its monopsony power as the exclusive buyer of wholesale 
electric power within the utility's service area to drive a qualifying facility out of business by demanding a predatory price.  908 F. 
Supp. at 1203. The district court determined that the utility's monopsony power did not pose a threat to increased consumer 
prices and that the qualifying facility's demand for payments in excess of the utility's avoided cost was not supported by the 
antitrust laws. Id. at 1203-05."
130,17," SER's assertion that the stay prevented SER from filing a motion for leave to amend the Amended Complaint is belied by the 
fact that (1) almost three months elapsed between the time PP&L filed its motion to dismiss and the time the court entered its 
stay order; (2) SER filed several letter briefs with the court during the stay; and (3) SER did not seek leave from the stay for 
permission to file a motion for leave to amend. Thus, we will focus on whether we should excuse SER's failure to seek leave to 
amend its Amended Complaint. "
131,18,"  We do not decide whether the district court should have construed the two footnotes as a motion for leave to amend, and we, 
therefore, do not decide whether the district court abused its discretion in failing to grant such a motion.  Miklavic v. USAir Inc., 
21 F.3d 551, 553 (3d Cir. 1994) (decision to dismiss with prejudice without granting leave to amend is subject to appellate review 
under abuse of discretion standard). It is sufficient that we find that SER is not entitled to amend its Amended Complaint."
131,19," SER also argued that the district court erred in granting PP&L's motion for a stay of proceedings and referring the case on 
primary jurisdiction grounds to the PUC for an administrative proceeding to determine the regulatory propriety of PP&L's 
generation curtailment policies. See United States v. Western Pac. R.R. Co., 352 U.S. 59, 63-64, 77 S. Ct. 161, 165, 1 L. Ed. 2d 
126 (1956) (discussing application of primary jurisdiction doctrine); Fulton Cogeneration Assocs. v. Niagara Mohawk Power 
Corp., 84 F.3d 91, 97 (2d Cir. 1996) (same). Given our disposition of the other issues raised in this appeal, we need not decide 
SER's challenge to the district court's stay order. "
136,1," Cigna Property and Casualty Insurance Company and its Codefendants are all licensed property and casualty insurance 
companies operating under the umbrella of CIGNA."
136,2," VFIS and its fellow plaintiffs are all subsidiaries of the Arthur J. Glatfelter Agency, Inc."
136,3," ESO's include fire companies, ambulance squads, rescue squads and similar entities which provide emergency services. The 
insurance market consisting of these organizations was referred to by the parties as ""volunteer fire business."""
136,4," CIGNA executed the agreement and addendum on July 21, 1994. VFIS executed the agreement and addendum on September 
1, 1994. The agreement governed generally the relationship between the subsidiaries of the Glatfelter Agency and the property 
and casualty insurers operating as part of CIGNA. The addendum governed specifically the CIGNA-VFIS relationship vis-a-vis 
the ESO insurance business and is the document which is directly at issue in this case. "
137,5," The final decree entered by the trial court stated as follows: AND NOW, TO WIT: This 26th day of September, 1996, we order and decree the following:"
137,1," . The prayer of the Petition of Plaintiff VFIS is granted, and Defendant CIGNA is enjoined from competing with VFIS in 
contravention of the provisions of Section 10 of the VFIS Addendum to the Agency/Company Agreement dated to be effective as 
of January 1, 1993."
137,2," . Defendant CIGNA is enjoined for a period of three (3) years from June 1, 1996, from directly or indirectly soliciting, selling or 
issuing a voluntary property/casualty policy to any Volunteer Fire Business, except for Volunteer Fire Business which is part of a 
municipal account. The prohibition shall apply to all of the ESO market identified in Section 1 of the VFIS Addendum and to the 
states of the United States of America, with the exception of the state of Hawaii."
137,3," . CIGNA is enjoined from, directly or indirectly, using, disclosing or retaining any trade secrets or confidential information of 
VFIS, including but not limited to, any information which relates to research, computer and management information systems, 
expiration dates, claims procedures, development, purchasing, finances, profit sharing, acquisition activity, accounting, non-
public rating information, underwriting loss ratios, engineering marketing, merchandising, planning and selling or the identity of 
present and prospective customers, agents and regional directors. Nothing in this Decree shall preclude CIGNA from 
maintaining such records as it is required to maintain by law or from making use of such records to carry out any duties imposed 
by statute or regulation. Notwithstanding the above, access to such records shall be limited to persons actively involved in 
carrying out said duties and solely for the purpose of carrying out such duties. CIGNA shall continue timely to provide VFIS all 
information respecting claims, losses and loss development related to the VFIS book of emergency service organization 
business as was provided prior to May 31, 1996."
137,6," The latter argument will be discussed infra as part of CIGNA's challenge regarding Pennsylvania public policy and federal 
antitrust law. "
138,7," The cases relied upon by CIGNA, Piercing Pagoda, Inc. v. Hoffman, 465 Pa. 500, 351 A.2d 207 (1976); George W. Kistler, Inc. 
v. O'Brien, 464 Pa. 475, 347 A.2d 311 (1975), Morgan's Home Equip. Corp. v. Martucci, 390 Pa. 618, 136 A.2d 838 (1957) and 
Davis & Warde, Inc. v. Tripodi, 420 Pa. Super. 450, 616 A.2d 1384 (1992) do not prohibit the enforcement of the type of 
restrictive covenant at issue in this case. HN1[
] In reviewing the enforceability of restrictive covenants, our courts have placed 
primary focus on whether the restraint (covenant) is ancillary to the main purpose of the agreement rather than on the nature of 
the relationship between the parties. The controlling question thus is stated, whether the promisee has a protectible interest such 
that a reasonable covenant not to compete, effective upon termination of the agreement, would be enforceable against the 
promisor. Thus, the fact that the instant relationship cannot fit neatly into one of the above categories, does not render it per se 
unenforceable. See Piercing Pagoda, supra (while caselaw is silent as to validity of restrictive covenant in a franchise 
agreement, covenant's enforceability is governed by the general principle that a reasonable covenant not to compete will be 
enforced where franchisor has protectible interest in sale of franchise to promisor). It is only where the sole object of both parties 
in making the contract is to restrain trade or control prices that the covenant will be declared void. "
139,8," In Piercing Pagoda, supra, the first two elements were examined under the more general inquiry of whether the covenant 
related to either a contract of employment or a sale of a business. As the Piercing Pagoda court explained, this general inquiry, 
included the more specific questions of whether the covenant was ancillary to the main purpose of a lawful business transaction 
and whether it was necessary to protect a party's legitimate interest. "
141,9," We likewise reject CIGNA's contentions that (1) section 8 was amended and (2) the trial court impermissibly relied on extrinsic 
evidence in resolving this issue. With respect to the former allegation, we find no support in the record. The only change agreed 
to by the parties was an extension of the addendum until May 31, 1996, with 90 days notice of non-renewal, for the purpose of 
creating an orderly transition. There is no indication that this agreement would, in any way, affect what action constituted 
termination or prevent the enforcement of the noncompetition provision. With respect to the latter allegation, we likewise find no merit. Ordinary meanings are given to words unless circumstances show 
that a different meaning is applicable.  Rothstein v. Actra Ins. Co., 216 Pa. Super. 418, 268 A.2d 233 (1970). Although a 
dictionary definition of a word must give way to use of the word made in the contract, Galvin v. Occidental Life Ins. Co., 206 Pa. 
Super. 61, 211 A.2d 120 (1965), there is no inconsistency between the dictionary definition and the use of ""termination"" in the 
addendum. "
150,1," The Malek and Halida plaintiffs have settled their claims against defendants North Central Health Plan of Wisconsin and 
Rhinelander Medical Center, S.C. "
153,2," Plaintiffs had named fifteen additional counties in their first brief but indicate in their reply brief that ""these plaintiffs propose a 
class consisting of purchasers"" from the nine counties listed. "
170,1, Iams owns two distributors located in California and Arizona. These distributors do not play a role in this dispute. 
175,2," As noted above, Iams moved to strike the Levvintre affidavit. Levvintre's deposition was later taken. Although the Court will 
deny the motion to strike, it agrees with Iams that Levvintre's testimony is largely irrelevant, given that NutriPet, not Bushmill, is 
Countryside's supplier. "
176,3," The parties discuss at length the definition of the relevant market. As noted above, Falduti asserts that the market is all 
superpremium pet foods, in which Iams holds the first or second greatest share. Iams, by contrast, defines the market as all dog 
and cat foods, regardless of grade, in which Iams hold only a 4% share. Much is said of cross-elasticity and low barriers to entry 
and other factors relevant to the determination of the relevant market. Because the Court finds that Falduti is not able to 
establish the requisite conspiracy or agreement, the Court need not further discuss the definition of the relevant market. "
177,4," The Court notes that Iams presented evidence, which Falduti does not dispute, that no distributor was ever terminated for 
failure to adhere to the suggested prices. "
192,*," The Honorable Gordon Thompson, Jr., United States District Court Judge for the Southern District of California, sitting by 
designation. "
196,1," Title 15 U.S.C. § 2 provides: HN9[
] Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or 
persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be 
deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $ 10,000,000 if a corporation, 
or, if any other person, $ 350,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding three years, or by both said punishments, in the 
discretion of the court. "
199,2," Title 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) provides: HN26[
] Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of 
the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. "
201,3," The district court cannot be faulted for ruling to the contrary. It did not have the benefit of Merchants Home, decided in 1995, 
when it rendered its summary judgment in this case."
201,4," Title 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) provides: HN34[
] It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of 
which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such 
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt. "
218,1," A&S based the price it paid for gas on a ""netback"" formula, which arrives at a price by subtracting the cost of transportation 
from Alberta to California from the price of gas produced in the southwestern United States and transported to California. This is 
one of only two methods of price calculation that the Canadian regulatory structure permits. The other permissible method of 
price calculation requires the parties to submit to arbitration."
218,2," The remaining claims - claims for injunctive relief - became moot when the contracts expired in October 1993 and are not 
before us on this appeal. "
222,3," The Supreme Court in Nantahala did not entirely foreclose the possibility of a claim based on allocation: Without deciding this issue, we may assume that a particular quantity of power procured by a utility from a particular source 
could be deemed unreasonably excessive if lower cost power is available elsewhere, even though the higher cost power 
actually purchased is obtained at a FERC-approved, and therefore reasonable, price."
222,476, U.S. at 972 (emphasis in original). 
224,4," The Cellular Plus court gave a litany of reasons for its decision not to follow Keogh and Square D, see 14 Cal. App. 4th at 
1242, and though several of those reasons make clear that Cellular Plus is readily distinguishable from the instant case, the 
most salient reason is the total absence of federal review."
224,5," In light of our determination that the filed rate doctrine bars all of plaintiffs' claims, we need not reach the merits of the other 
defenses that defendants have raised. "
230,1," The Court grants Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Brief, although the Court believes the issues and arguments 
raised in the Supplemental Brief are sufficiently addressed in Plaintiffs' 65-page Reply Brief. The Court alerts all parties that 
future briefing schedules will be significantly more abbreviated than the period employed for class certification. The Court also grants Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to Submit Supplemental Authority. The Court finds Plaintiffs' (and Defendants') 
technique of supporting legal propositions with case law rather refreshing, and will welcome with open arms further such efforts 
in this case. "
231,2," Also pending is a counterclaim filed by Defendant Shaw Industries, Inc. against Plaintiff The Carpet Fair, Inc."
231,3," The Court is most appreciative of the fine research and analysis supplied by the parties in these briefs. The Court cannot enter 
an Order on the issue, because such an Order would constitute an advisory opinion on a matter not presently before the Court. 
The Court has carefully reviewed the briefs, however, and intends to proceed with an expeditious resolution of this case. "
232,4, The standard of decision for class certification proceedings is discussed in greater detail in Part III infra.
232,5," Defendant Beaulieu also argues that the conspiracy at issue in this consolidated action is limited to the contours of a criminal 
antitrust indictment to which Defendant Sunrise pleaded guilty in June 1995. For the reasons set forth in Part IV.B.2.c.(1) infra, 
this argument is without merit. "
233,6," The Court does not mean to suggest that it suffers from an unhealthy suspicion of authority from other circuits; rather, the Court 
simply recognizes that an abundance of soundly reasoned and directly relevant authority already exists in this circuit. This 
authority, in the Court's view, largely curtails the need to search elsewhere for guidance. The Court greatly appreciates the 
parties' exhaustive research of national case law involving antitrust class actions, and will rely on cases from other circuits where 
appropriate."
233,7," Opinions of the Fifth Circuit issued prior to October 1, 1981, the date marking the creation of the Eleventh Circuit, are binding 
precedent on this Court. See Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209-11 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc). "
236,8," The Court recognizes that Rule 23(a)(2)'s commonality requirement overlaps in significant degree with the predominance 
requirement contained in Rule 23(b)(3). Several courts therefore consider together the predominance requirement and the 
commonality requirement. See Domestic Air, 137 F.R.D. at 684 n.8 (""because of the overlap between the commonality 
requirement . . . and the predominance requirement . . ., courts often deal with the two issues simultaneously"") (citing 3 
Newburg, supra, § 18.27 at 497). The Court believes this practice has merit but is unnecessary in this case, where the evidence 
clearly establishes the existence of common questions of law and fact to satisfy Rule 23(a)(2). "
238,9," Several Defendants argue that an industry with nonuniform products, markets, and distribution methods necessarily prevents a 
finding that common issues predominate with respect to antitrust impact and damages. (E.g., Defendant Beaulieu's Brief in 
Response to Plaintiffs' Reply Brief at 10; Defendant Shaw's Brief in Opposition to Class Certification at 13; Defendants Mohawk 
and Aladdin's Memorandum in Opposition to Class Certification at 14.)"
238,10," Indeed, Blue Bird observed that ""there are no hard and fast rules which have developed regarding the suitability of a particular 
type of antitrust case for class action treatment. The unique facts of each case will generally be the determining factor governing 
certification."" 573 F.2d at 316; see also Telecomm Technical, 172 F.R.D. at 543, 1997 WL 154783, at *9 (quoting this passage). "
239,11," Conversely, a rule that absolutely forecloses a finding that common issues predominate in cases involving diverse markets 
and products would allow companies to evade enforcement of the antitrust laws simply by creating complex pricing structures 
and distribution channels. "
241,12," Compare Blue Bird, 573 F.2d at 328 n.36: ""[In a diversified market], it would be most difficult, if not impossible, to establish any 
sort of 'competitive' price because of the variety of [products] and the various marketing schemes."" The court later qualifies this 
statement: ""We are not attempting . . . to hold as a matter of law that the impact requirement in the case before us defeats any 
possibility of a class certification. It may be that the … plaintiffs can figure out some way to show impact without having to resort 
to lengthy individualized examinations."" Id. at 328."
241,13," Consistent with the status of antitrust law in 1978, Blue Bird does not consider the computation of damages as a separate 
element of proof required to obtain damages under the Clayton Act. The Court does not believe this difference to be of any 
substance to the analysis set forth in this section. "
243,14," As such, the Court disagrees with Coleman's view that evidence regarding the complexity of the industry underlying the 
alleged antitrust conspiracy is a ""red herring."" 141 F.R.D. at 526. Under Blue Bird, such evidence is highly relevant to the inquiry 
of whether common proof of impact will predominate at trial.  Blue Bird, 573 F.2d at 327-28; see also Domestic Air, 137 F.R.D. at 
686 n.10 (under Blue Bird, a court must ""examine and understand the relevant industry"")."
243,15," Defendants Mohawk and Aladdin have filed a Notice of Objection to Prof. Asher's affidavit, and other Defendants have raised 
various objections in their briefs. The Court has reviewed these objections and finds them to be without merit. "
244,16," See also Dry Cleaning, 1993 WL 527928, at *4 (""The preliminary inquiry is not whether each of the methods is valid, but only 
to assess whether the methods are able to prove damages on a class basis.""). The Court is unsure how it could assess whether 
a proposed formula ""is able to prove damages on a class basis"" without analyzing the validity of the formula's methodology."
244,17," The Court thus rejects any suggestions by Defendants that Prof. Asher's affidavit is inadmissible under Daubert v. Merrell Dow 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469, 113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993). "
257,1," In 1994, 135 of these members authorized the NFSA to represent them in multi-employer collective bargaining, 60 members 
negotiated separately with Local 669, and the remaining 75 members were non-union contractors."
257,2," Although revoking bargaining authority, Grinnell has remained a member of the NFSA."
257,3," A Letter of Understanding was executed by representatives of the Union and the NFSA in November of 1991. A similar 
document was later executed in November of 1992, extending the program through May 31, 1993."
257,4," The offering of such an interim agreement to an employer not represented in multi-employer bargaining is a fairly common 
strategy employed by unions in preparing for negotiations. See, e.g., Charles D. Bonanno Linen Serv., Inc., 243 N.L.R.B. 1093 
(1979), aff'd, 454 U.S. 404, 70 L. Ed. 2d 656, 102 S. Ct. 720 (1982). "
258,5," While the parties were still engaged in negotiations, Grinnell in February of 1994 had filed a charge of unfair labor practices 
against the Union. It was alleged that the offer of Local 669 to extend targeting only to contractors represented by the NFSA and 
to certain independents who signed Assent and Interim Agreements constituted an unfair labor practice. On April 13, 1994, the 
Regional Director declined to issue a complaint and that refusal was later upheld by the Office of Appeals."
258,6," These complaints have been docketed before the NLRB as Cases 5-CA-24521, 5-CA-25227 and 5-CA-25406."
258,7," The ALJ also found that Grinnell had violated § 8(a)(1) and § 8(a)(3) and (1) of the Act and that the strike which commenced on 
April 12 was a lawful unfair labor practice strike. "
262,8," In a letter dated January 12, 1995 to the NLRB, counsel for Grinnell acknowledged that the targeting program ""had not been 
included in the parties' Agreement and was completely discretionary. . . ."" "
263,9," A ""most favored nation clause"" in a collective bargaining agreement is an undertaking by the union that if it later agrees to more 
advantageous terms with another employer, the employer with the most favored nation clause in its agreement will receive the 
benefit of those more favorable terms. See, e.g., Associated Milk Dealers, Inc. v. Milk Drivers Union, Local 753, 422 F.2d 546 
(7th Cir. 1970). "
265,10," There is no merit to Grinnell's further contention that the defendants' conduct in withdrawing targeting from Grinnell constituted 
an illegal tying arrangement prohibited by the Sherman Act. None of the cases cited by Grinnell furnish support for its claim that 
conduct of the sort involved in this case during a labor dispute can constitute an illegal tying arrangement prohibited by antitrust 
law. "
266,11," Although no res judicata or collateral estoppel effect may be given to the Regional Director's refusal to issue a complaint 
based on the same claim asserted by Grinnell in Count Two, his findings in this context ""are entitled to great weight."" Hanna 
Mining Co. v. District 2, Marine Eng'rs Beneficial Ass'n, 382 U.S. 181, 192, 86 S. Ct. 327, 15 L. Ed. 2d 254 (1965). Faced 
with the Regional Director's determination, Grinnell has the burden of demonstrating that genuine issues of fact exist in spite of 
the Board's finding.  Smith v. Local No. 25, Sheet Metal Workers Int'l Ass'n, 500 F.2d 741, 748 n.4 (5th Cir. 1974). Grinnell has 
failed in this case to meet that burden. "
267,12," The projects in question were the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant in Lusby, Maryland, the Onondago County Resource 
Recovery Facility in Onondago, New York, the Conemaugh Power Station in New Florence, Pennsylvania, the Selkirk II Project 
in Selkirk, New York and the Cooling Tower Project in New Martinsville, West Virginia. "
268,13," The Philadelphia Building Trades Council is an association of construction unions in the Philadelphia area. Membership in the

284,8," In Parker, the Supreme Court treated the issue of state action immunity as one of preemption.  63 S. Ct. at 314. The Supreme 
Court and appellate court cases cited have clarified that state action immunity is an affirmative defense. See, e.g., Columbia 
Steel Casting, 103 F.3d 1446, 1455; Yeager's Fuel, 22 F.3d at 1266; Tarabishi v. McAlester Regional Hosp., 951 F.2d 1558,

rebates and incentives by regional companies was a foreseeable consequence of the state's regulatory policy of promoting load 
management and energy conservation, the defendant had satisfied the first prong of the Midcal test, even though the state had 
not specifically approved of these practices); F.T.C. v. Hospital Bd. of Directors of Lee County, 38 F.3d 1184, 1192 (11th Cir. 
1994) (holding that a county hospital board's purchase of a private hospital was immune from antitrust attack under the state 
action doctrine because the purchase was a foreseeable consequence of the state's policy of allowing the county to purchase 
medical facilities); Unity Ventures v. Lake County, 841 F.2d 770, 778 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 109 S. Ct. 226 (1988) (where the 
state authorized counties and municipalities to contract together and combine resources for the provision of sewage treatment 
services, an agreement between a county and a village, giving the village control over access to sewer connections in its 
""sphere of influence,"" was a foreseeable consequence of the state action and immune from antitrust challenge). "
289,12," The absence of an express mention of the transport-or-pay provisions in the state statute creating the CPUC statutory 
framework is not determinative. See Martin v. Memorial Hosp. at Gulfport, 86 F.3d at 1398 (""if the city acts pursuant to a clearly 
articulated state statutory scheme, it is irrelevant that the statutes make no express mention of anticompetitive conduct""). If the 
""suppression of competition is the 'foreseeable result' of what the state authorizes,"" the first prong of the Midcal test is satisfied.  
City of Columbia, 111 S. Ct. at 1350."
289,13, Decision 9 states: 
290,," While estimates of lost utility revenue vary depending on projected EOR demand levels, projected EOR transportation 
rates, and the projected extent of industrial load loss, if any, potential rate impacts in the range of more than $ 100 million 
annually are likely and are large enough to be of deep concern to this Commission. . . . Over the past year, we have taken a number of actions designed to address these concerns. With respect to the EOR 
producers' concern for firmness of service, we have already endorsed the concept of allowing EOR customers to obtain 
more secure service by paying higher rates. And we have specifically granted the utilities the flexibility to negotiate higher 
priority service for EOR customers through non-standard service contracts."
290,22," CPUC2d at 481; Docket Entry No. 6, Exhibit 4, p. 481."
290,14," Plaintiffs oppose this court's consideration of the CPUC amicus curiae brief, asserting that it is a ""one-sided assertion of facts."" 
(Docket Entry No. 42, pp. 2-3). The CPUC's amicus brief is properly before this court. Plaintiff's objection is overruled. See, e.g., 
Hook v. Morrison Milling Co., 38 F.3d 776, 786 n.13 (5th Cir. 1994) (noting that the court's decision comported with the outcome 
supported by the Department of Labor in its amicus brief); First Gibraltar Bank, FSB v. Morales, 19 F.3d 1032, 1052 (5th Cir.

preempted Texas homestead law, both in the [agency] Letter and in the [agency] amicus brief filed in the instant cause, the

291,15," Plaintiffs also submitted the affidavit of Donald Asher, who negotiated the contracts at issue on behalf of the plaintiffs. (Docket 
Entry No. 14, p. 16, n.18). Asher testified that CPUC commissioner Donald Vial had advised him that Decisions 9 and 10 
governed the EOR market negotiations. (Docket Entry No. 14, App. B). SoCalGas objects to this testimony as hearsay; this court 
agrees. Plaintiffs also submitted the affidavit of Albert G. Boyce, vice president of Tannehill Electric Company, Inc., a company 
which has also sued SoCalGas under the antitrust laws. Boyce's affidavit states that Hulett told him that the CPUC did not want 
transport-or-pay provisions to be used. (Docket Entry No. 39, Exhibit 4, at P 4). Boyce's statement is also based on hearsay. "
292,16," Plaintiffs also cite to an advice letter, written by R.M. Rawlings, SoCalGas's vice president of regulatory affairs on August 5, 
1988, which plaintiffs assert ""recognizes that Decisions 9 and 10 apply to EOR customers."" (Docket Entry No. 57, Exhibit 8, p.2). 
The letter discusses the provisions of Decision 9, authorizing negotiating flexibility for contracts with noncore EOR customers. 
(Id.). The letter does not mention Decision 10 at all. (Id.). Plaintiffs also submit the affidavit testimony of two experts in market regulation of California gas utility companies, who state that 
Decision 10 applied to the contracts at issue; and that there was no exception for individually negotiated long-term EOR 
contracts. (Docket Entry No. 60, Exhibits 8 and 9). These affidavits present legal conclusions and do not raise a fact issue. "
294,17," SoCalGas objects to this summary judgment evidence as irrelevant and inadmissible hearsay. (Docket Entry No. 66, p. 3). 
The DRA's position with regard to the elimination of unfettered control by the CPUC is relevant to the question of whether the 
CPUC surrendered its power of active supervision. The DRA's argument is not being presented to evidence the CPUC's opinion 
on that issue, and is, therefore, not hearsay. SoCalGas's objections are overruled. "
302,18," SoCalGas objects to this testimony as unsupported. The affidavits clearly state that this opinion is based on a comparison of 
the California Gas Reports. SoCalGas's objection is overruled. "
316,1," The Court's opinion could be read to suggest that there are only three different possible accrual rules--last predicate act, injury 
discovery, and injury and pattern discovery. See ante, at 4-5, 10-12. In fact, as is alluded to in its rejection of the Third Circuit's 
last predicate act rule, see ante, at 7-8, there is a fourth accrual rule--the Clayton Act ""injury"" rule. "
317,2," ""Both RICO and the Clayton Act are designed to remedy economic injury by providing for the recovery of treble damages, 
costs, and attorney's fees. Both statutes bring to bear the pressure of 'private attorneys general' on a serious national problem 
for which public prosecutorial resources are deemed inadequate; the mechanism chosen to reach the objective in both the 
Clayton Act and RICO is the carrot of treble damages. Moreover, both statutes aim to compensate the same type of injury; each 
requires that a plaintiff show injury 'in his business or property by reason of' a violation."" 483 U.S. at 151. "
318,3," The Court disclaims any intent to adopt a ""mix-and-match"" approach, ante, at 12, but that seems to me inconsistent with its 
repeated references to the possibility of a discovery accrual rule--which is (and has been thought to be) the antithesis of the 
Clayton Act injury accrual rule. If the Court merely means to say that it is not sure how the Clayton Act accrual rule would apply 
in this case, then it should simply say so--thereby going a long way towards resolving the Circuit split and rendering this 
concurrence unnecessary. "

(AJAX and PALMOLIVE). "
342,4," Accordingly, we are not faced with the question of whether, if Clorox made out an antitrust case that Cyanamid conspired with 
Sterling to violate the antitrust laws, the defendants would have a defense based on Cyanamid's role in the violation. See United 
States Football League v. National Football League, 842 F.2d 1335, 1369 (2d Cir. 1988) (""It is true that a plaintiff's own 
anticompetitive conduct generally cannot be raised as a defense to liability in an antitrust action. The defense may be available, 
however, when the plaintiff was present at the creation and had a complete and continuing involvement in the monopolization 
scheme."" (internal citations omitted)). "
350,1," FPL filed an erroneous ""Notice to the Court"" that its Motion had been pending since ""June 17, 1997, without disposition."" Doc. 
82. According to the Court file, FPL mistakenly filed a Memorandum of Law in Support of A Renewed Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 
72), without filing ""the Renewed Motion,"" in violation of the Local Rules. The Court ordered FPL to file a Motion to Dismiss or 
have the Memorandum stricken; the Motion was then filed in compliance with the Court's order on December 20, 1996 (Doc. 80)."
350,2," Aquatherm filed a twenty-page memorandum of law which was not double-spaced (twenty-two lines per page), as required by 
Local Rule 1.05(a), but was only one-and-a-half spaced (thirty-one lines per page). The actual length of Aquatherm's 
memorandum, if properly double-spaced, would have been twenty-eight pages and would have exceeded significantly the 
twenty-page limit of Local Rule 3.01(c). The Court has previously stricken a memorandum in excess of twenty pages filed by 
former cocounsel for Aquatherm. Doc. 33. Future violations of the local or federal rules will result in sanctions. "
352,3, Aquatherm's claim for violation of the federal Lanham Act was previously dismissed on res judicata grounds. 
357,4," Doc. 76 at 18 (""While neither the Supreme Court nor the Eleventh Circuit has yet decided whether to follow Berkey Photo in 
assessing a claim of monopoly leveraging . . . .""). "
380,1," The court does not agree with defendant's contention that plaintiff's attempted monopolization claim is insufficient for failure to 
allege a relevant market. See TV Communications, 964 F.2d at 1025-26. The complaint adequately names the night vision 
product market. The court does agree that plaintiff's complaint does not sufficiently allege the existence of a conspiracy 
(conspiracy in restraint of trade and conspiracy to monopolize claims) or defendant's market power (attempt to monopolize 
claim). Although such failures are fatal to antitrust pleading, see id., they are more procedural than substantive in nature, and the 
court would ordinarily permit amendment to cure the deficiencies. The absence of antitrust injury or anti-competitive conduct, 
however, dooms plaintiff's antitrust claims on substantive grounds, thereby requiring judgment for defendant on the pleadings 
under rule 12(c). "
381,2," The court concludes that Kansas substantive law controls plaintiff's defamation and tortious interference claims. When 
exercising diversity jurisdiction, the court must apply the forum state's choice of law rules to determine which state's substantive 
law applies.  Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 496, 85 L. Ed. 1477, 61 S. Ct. 1020 (1941). In Kansas, tort 
actions are governed by the law of the state where the tort occurred, that is, the state where the wrong was felt.  Ling v. Jan's 
Liquors, 237 Kan. 629, 634-35, 703 P.2d 731 (1985). Because the alleged wrong to plaintiff involved financial harm, the court 
would look to the state in which plaintiff felt that financial injury. See Lawrence-Leiter & Co. v. Paulson, 963 F. Supp. 1061, 1065 
(D. Kan. 1997) (in defamation action, concluding that Kansas courts would apply law of state of plaintiff's domicile, where plaintiff 
felt injury from alleged tort); St. Paul Furniture Mfg. Co. v. Bergman, 935 F. Supp. 1180, 1187 (D. Kan. 1996) (same conclusion 
in case involving tortious interference claim). Thus, because plaintiff's principal place of business is in Kansas, Kansas law 
applies to both the defamation and tortious interference claims. "
391,1," Section 4 of the Clayton Act states, in relevant part, HN1[
] ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by 
reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor … and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, 
and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."" Section 16 states, in relevant part, HN2[
] ""any person … shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, … against 
threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws."""
391,2," Section 1 states, in relevant part, HN3[
] ""every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in 
restraint of trade or commerce among the several States … is hereby declared to be illegal."""
391,3," It is somewhat unclear from the complaint whether MMHOs are paid based on the number of participants in the MCO as a 
whole, or on the number of participants within the MCO who utilize MMHO services. "
392,4," Thus, the effect of capitation is that the lesser the amount of treatment authorized, the greater the short-term profits of the 
MMHO."
392,5," HN5[
] Rule 8(a) provides, in relevant part, ""A pleading which sets forth a claim for relief, … shall contain … a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief …."" "
393,6," Although plaintiffs generally refer to a ""contract, combination or conspiracy,"" they nowhere plead the existence of a contract or 
combination; but instead refer throughout the complaint to ""the conspiracy"" and ""defendants [and/or] their co-conspirators."" 
(Compl. PP 21-23, 30-32, 40-41, 44(b) and (c), 45.)"
393,7," We also observe at the outset that all of plaintiffs' allegations are based on information and belief. Although in the antitrust 
context such allegations are acceptable, see Electronics Communications Corp. v. Toshiba America Consumer Products, Inc., 
1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11527, No. 96 Civ. 1565, 1996 WL 455011, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 13, 1996), we pause to note plaintiffs' 
odd placement of this assertion, namely, at the end of the paragraph entitled ""Jurisdiction."" "
394,8," HN9[
] Horizontal agreements restrain competition among competitors at the same level of distribution, such as the 
defendants here.  Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 730, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808, 108 S. Ct. 1515 
(1988). Vertical agreements are those forged between entities at different levels of distribution, such as an agreement between a 
manufacturer and a distributor. Id."
394,9, We note that plaintiffs do not allege territorial allocation of this national market.
394,10," For example, the named plaintiffs are based in New York, which requires state licensing for physicians, psychologists, and 
social workers. See N.Y. Educ. Law §§ 6524, 7603, 7704 (listing requirements for professional licenses in these professions). 
The states where defendant MMHOs are located each have similar requirements. See, e.g., the requirements in Maryland, 
where defendants CMG Health and Green Springs Health Services, Inc. are based, Md. Code Ann. Health Occ. §§ 14-301, 18-
301, 19-301 (requiring state licenses for physicians, psychologists and social workers); Virginia, where defendants FHC Options 
and Value Behavioral Health, Inc. are based, Va. Code Ann. §§ 54.1-2929, 54.1-3606, 54.1-3706 (requiring state licenses for 
physicians psychologists and social workers); and Minnesota, where defendants MCC Behavioral Care Inc. and United 
Behavioral Systems, Inc. are located, Minn. Stat. §§ 147.02, 148.907, 148B.21 (covering licensing of physicians, psychologists 
and social workers). Indeed, state law may also provide for the licensing and geographic restriction of MMHOs themselves. See, e.g., N.Y. Pub. 
Health Law § 4403-d (providing for certification and other requirements applicable to ""mental health special needs plans""). "
395,11," The inadequacy of plaintiffs' complaint becomes even clearer when it is compared with the pleadings in other cases that have 
withstood similar motions to dismiss. See, e.g., Discon, Inc. v. NYNEX Corp., 93 F.3d 1055, 1058-59 (2d Cir. 1996) (reversing 
district court's dismissal of complaint with respect to Sherman Act Section 1 claim where plaintiffs alleged the existence of 
various meetings between official representatives of the co-conspirators during which scheme was crafted to purchase services 
at inflated prices, pass the cost on to rate-paying customers, receive a secret year-end ""rebate,"" and discriminate against 
plaintiff), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 809, 118 S. Ct. 49, 139 L. Ed. 2d 14, 66 U.S.L.W. 3254 (U.S. 1997); Ancar v. Sara Plasma, Inc., 
964 F.2d 465, 468-69 (5th Cir. 1992) (reversing district court's dismissal of pro se plaintiff's allegation of conspiracy between 
buyers of blood plasma where plaintiff had provided ""examples of the standardized price range scale and the standard consent 
form language""); George C. Frey Ready-Mixed Concrete, Inc., 554 F.2d at 553 (reversing district court's dismissal of suit or 
grant of summary judgment where complaint had alleged that defendant bought plaintiffs' source of raw materials and 
subsequently forced plaintiffs out of business with a cost-price squeeze); AD/SAT, A Div. of Skylight, Inc. v. Associated Press, 
885 F. Supp. 511, 515-16 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (finding that complaint adequately stated Section 1 claim where plaintiff alleged an 
""invitation to conspire"" by one defendant and acceptance of that invitation by other defendants, as evidenced by the latters' 
cancelling contracts with plaintiff, announcing cancellations of such contracts, refusing to consider proposals from plaintiff, and 
refusing to pay plaintiff); Three Crown Ltd. Partnership, 817 F. Supp. at 1047-48 (complaint upheld where plaintiff alleged 
specifics of meeting and details of alleged ""squeezing"" of certain financial markets in order to artificially inflate prices). See also 
In re Nasdaq Market-Makers Antitrust Litigation, 894 F. Supp. 703 (complaint dismissed with leave to replead to add the names 
of specific stocks where conspiracy was otherwise adequately alleged, when plaintiffs included specifics regarding conspiracy to 
eliminate ""odd eighths"" from the stock spread an specifics of coercion tactics used to enforce the agreement). "
396,12," The phrase ""conscious parallelism"" describes conduct by rivals in an industry who ""coordinate their conduct simply by 
observing and reacting to the moves of their competitors."" Kovacic, ""The Identification and Proof of Horizontal Agreement Under 
the Antitrust Laws,"" at 31. The effect of such conscious action, such as parallel pricing, is not considered illegal in the absence of 
""additional facts and circumstances … to show that the decisions were interdependent and thus raise the inference of a tacit 
agreement …."" Id. at 33 n. 91, quoting Modern Home Institute, Inc. v. Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co., 513 F.2d 102 (2d Cir. 
1975)."
396,13," Examples of ""plus factors"" include the existence of a rational motive for defendants to behave collectively, actions taken 
contrary to a defendant's self-interest unless pursued as part of a collective plan, market phenomena that cannot be explained 
rationally except as the product of concerted action, and a defendant's record of past collusion-related antitrust violations. 
Kovacic at 31-55."
396,14," Plaintiffs also allege that defendants agreed to employ similar practices in their administration of mental health care, such as 
the receipt of capitated payments and the improper use of short-term health care therapy. (Compl. PP 42(b)(i) and (ii).) However, 
as we find below, similar methods of cutting costs are utilized by managed health care providers in all fields and do not raise 
antitrust issues. See, e.g., Milt Freudenheim, ""Pioneering State For Managed Care Considers Change,"" The New York Times, 
July 14, 1997, at A1 (describing the legislative backlash in California against numerous cost-cutting methods employed by 
HMOs). Therefore, we do not consider them examples of conscious parallelism."
396,15," As we mentioned above, plaintiffs describe themselves as a class of providers who have ""directly attempted to have their 
professional services … utilized … by any of the defendants or their co-conspirators …."" (Compl. P 23.) Without further 
clarification and in light of the rest of the complaint, we assume that plaintiffs did not become members of defendants' networks 
because they refused to accept defendants' rates of reimbursement and/or terms of employment. "
397,16," In fact, it is presently lawful under federal law for managed care networks to exclude even those doctors willing to comply with 
their terms, as long as those providers are able to compete effectively outside the network. See Levine v. Central Florida 
Medical Affiliates, Inc., 72 F.3d 1538, 1551 (11th Cir.) (following Dept. of Justice and Fed. Trade Commission's Enforcement 
Policy and Analytical Principles Relating to Health Care and Antitrust (1994) at 42), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 75 (1996). However, 
""any-willing-provider"" laws, which require networks to include all health care providers who agree to abide by the network's 
terms, are in effect in some states. See Constantine G. Papavizas and Norman F. Lent III, ""HMO Legislation is Aimed at 
Protecting Patients - Consumers and Providers Call for Regulation; the Managed Care Industry Would Disagree,"" Nat'l Law 
Journal, April 7, 1997, at B8."
397,17," Capitation ""has been described as a form of bribery."" Charles Stein, ""Money and Medicine - How the Profit Motive in Health 
Care May Turn Out to be good for Your Health,"" The Boston Globe, June 1, 1997, at 14. Physicians practicing in many areas of 
health care are finding fault with capitation and other financial incentive systems used by managed care organizations, and 
some are mobilizing to protest what they call ""the transform[ation of] healing from a covenant into a business contract."" Peter T. 
Kilborn, ""Doctors Organize to Fight Corporate Intrusion,"" The New York Times, July 1, 1997, at A12. "
398,18," To the extent plaintiffs complain of defendants' ""intruding into confidential matters"" separately from the issue of gag and 
nondisparagement orders, this too is a legislative matter. See, e.g., Alex Pham, ""HMOs: Managing Managed Care - Faced With 
Growing Constituent Complaints, Lawmakers Are Poised to File a Flurry of New Health Care Legislation,"" The Boston Globe, 
March 30, 1997, at F1 (describing proposed Massachusetts mental health bill that would ""Prohibit plans from requesting patient 
information beyond their name, diagnosis, and date and type of care requested,"" meant to respond to complaints of HMOs 
asking for ""excruciating amounts of detail"" about mental health history before deciding whether to pay for treatment)."
398,19," We recognize the general view that ""managed care so far as not demonstrated that it can handle mental health as 
competently as it handles physical ailments."" Stein at 14; accord Sandra G. Boodman, ""Managed Care Comes to Mental Health; 
Are Patients Getting What They Need?"" The Washington Post, May 6, 1997. Of recent note is the federal Mental Health Parity 
Act of 1996, which beginning in 1998 will forbid companies that employ fifty or more workers to establish different coverage limits 
for mental and physical illness, unless it would have a huge impact on premiums. See Elizabeth Neus, ""Poll: Mental, Physical 
Illnesses Should Get Same Level of Health Insurance,"" Gannett News Service, June 5, 1997. "
399,120," Plaintiffs also contend that they have been coerced and intimidated. (Compl. ¶ 41.) However, as absolutely no facts to 
support this allegation have been pled, we need not address this contention. "
400,21," Although plaintiffs complain of an agreement to decrease rather than increase prices, it is clear that both types of agreements 
may cause harm. Consequently, HN18[
] price fixing agreements that both lower and raise prices have been deemed per se 
illegal by the Supreme Court. See Arizona v. Maricopa County Med. Soc'y, 457 U.S. 332, 347, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48, 102 S. Ct. 2466 
(1982). It is the economic nature of the harm that flows from these two situations that differs. Specifically, an agreement to fix a 
maximum price ceiling may result in the selection of an price that deters entry into the market; such an agreement may be an 
implicit arrangement to forego additional service or quality improvements; or the set maximum price may become the minimum. 
See Frank H. Easterbrook, ""Maximum Price Fixing,"" 48 U. Chi. L. Rev. 886, 900-08 (1981). In addition, ""maximum prices may be 
fixed too low for the [provider] to furnish services essential to the value which goods have for the consumer …."" Arizona, 457 
U.S. at 347 (quoting Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145, 152-53, 19 L. Ed. 2d 998, 88 S. Ct. 869 (1968))."
400,22," Plaintiffs borrow this idea from a law review article. See Roger D. Blair and Jeffrey L. Harrison, Rethinking Antitrust Injury, 42 
Vand. L. Rev. 1539, 1565-69 (1989) (providing an economic analysis of the harm produced by ""collusive monopsony,"" a market 
situation in which a small group of large buyers (""oligopsonists"") colludes in order to fix the prices they will pay below the price 
that would prevail in the absence of an agreement)."
400,23," See Stein at 14 (discussing the complicated nature of measuring the quality of mental health care, ""where it is not easy to 
figure out even what to measure""). Senator Pete Domenici recently reaffirmed the need to ""strive to ensure quality of [mental "
401,," health] care and access to care. We must develop procedures to evaluate treatment measures used by managed care 
companies."" ""Report: Mental Health Parity Affordable - Pete Domenici,"" Gov't Press Releases, April 29, 1997."
401,24," HN20[
] Analysis under the rule of reason proceeds in three steps: ""Plaintiff bears the initial burden of showing that the 
challenged action has had an actual adverse effect on competition as a whole in the relevant market. If the plaintiff succeeds, 
the burden shifts to the defendant to establish the pro-competitive redeeming virtues of the action. Should the defendant carry 
this burden, the plaintiff must then show that the same pro-competitive effect could be achieved through an alternative means 
that is less restrictive of competition."" K.M.B. Warehouse Distribs., Inc. v. Walker Mfg. Co., 61 F.3d 123, 127 (2d Cir. 1995) 
(quotation and citations omitted). "
402,25," See William Branigin and Pamela Constable, ""Foundering in a Wave of Immigrants; U.S. Prosperity Eludes Millions of 
Newcomers,"" The Washington Post, May 10, 1997, at A1 (describing the current population of the United States as 265 million 
people, projected to grow to nearly 400 million in the next fifty years). Even if we consider defendants' market share as a percentage of the amount of Americans who have health insurance, which is 
approximately 225 million people, defendants still occupy only 36% of the market. See Eric Pooley, ""Too Good to Be True? By 
Almost Any Measure, Life is Swell in the U.S. What Went Right?"" Time Magazine, May 19, 1997, at 28 (quoting former Labor 
Secretary Robert Reich stating that forty-four million Americans lack health insurance)."
402,26," See also Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 25, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 (1984) (holding in 
product-tying claim that thirty percent control of market was insufficient to warrant a finding of per se invalidity); U.S. Healthcare, 
Inc. v. Healthsource, Inc., 986 F.2d 589, 596 (1st Cir. 1993) (holding that power over twenty-five percent of relevant market was

Laboratories, Inc., 926 F. Supp. 371, 374 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (finding in claim under Section 2 of the Sherman Act that party in 
control of twenty-five to thirty percent of market ""does not even arguably have market power"")."
402,27, We note that plaintiffs make no allegation that defendants have engaged in territorial allocation of the market. 
415,1, It is alleged that the choice was to stock Gerber and either Heinz or Beech-Nut baby foods. 
418,2," Ron Coble testified via deposition that the term ""truce"" had nothing to do with Beech-Nut, but instead involved an internal 
dispute between Heinz's marketing and sales departments. "
420,3, Plaintiffs merely contend that the parallel increase in list prices caused the transaction prices to increase as well. 
421,4," Plaintiffs assert that United States v. Container Corp. of America held that the exchange of current price information, even 
absent any impact on prices, was sufficient to establish a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. United States v. Container 
Corp. of America, 393 U.S. 333, 89 S. Ct. 510, 21 L. Ed. 2d 526 (1969). Container Corp. dealt with shared pricing information as 
to certain identified customers in a fairly small market. The case sub judice is clearly distinguishable."
421,5," ""Parallel"" is defined as ""extending in the same direction, equidistant at all points, and never converging or diverging"" or ""having 
the same direction, nature, tendency, or course."" Random House Webster's College Dictionary (1991)."
421,6," Plaintiffs contend that it is telling that defendants' prices were often within a fraction of one cent of each other. However, this is 
based on per ounce prices, which the industry does not use when setting list prices. Per ounce prices are necessarily within a 
fraction of one cent of each other due to the relatively minimal per ounce cost. "
424,7," For example, there are two 1985 Beech-Nut internal bulletins notifying the Beech-Nut sales force of future couponing programs 
which were produced by Gerber. Such information could have come from a distributor or customer of Gerber, not necessarily 
from Gerber itself. Additionally, plaintiffs point to a 1989 Gerber electronic mail message reporting a meeting in which a Heinz 
sales representative informed a Gerber sales representative of Heinz's future plans to come out with a six-pack of juice. Another 
document reflects a ""rumor"" received about Gerber's packaging of juice. Plaintiffs also reference a July 29, 1992 Gerber memorandum reflecting Gerber's knowledge of Beech-Nut's ""target date for 
removing starch and flour from a number of their items, the target date for conversion of Stage 1 and 2 foods to 4 ounce 
containers, and the upcoming tropical line."" Plaintiffs point to additional documentation reflecting one defendant's knowledge of another defendant's plans for marketing, 
packaging, or product changes."
424,8," Plaintiffs point to the testimony of Brian Anderson, an ex-Heinz field salesperson, concerning his contacts with Gerber and 
Beech-Nut field sales personnel. He testified at his deposition that some of Gerber's or Beech-Nut's representatives might give 
him pricing information on occasion if they had such information, but that they did not have such information often. Moreover, Mr. 
Anderson ceased being responsible for stocking shelves  [*39] with baby food well before the start of the alleged conspiracy. "
444,1," Plaintiff also pleaded a claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1952. That statute, however, has been repealed."
444,2," During a pre-motion conference held on February 11, 1997, plaintiff voluntarily agreed to dismiss his claims against defendants 
Karen Burstein; Bernard Zirin; Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette; and Suburbia Federal Savings and Loan. Accordingly, plaintiff's 
actions against such defendants were dismissed by Order on February 13, 1997."
444,3," A complete recitation of plaintiff's allegations would be lengthy and confusing. Thus, I have only briefly described plaintiff's 
material allegations to place the legal issues raised by defendants' motions in a factual context. "
446,4," The first clause of Section 1985(2), which proscribes conspiracies to interfere with federal court proceedings, does not require 
allegations of class-based discrimination. See Zemsky, 821 F.2d at 151 n.4 (citing Kush v. Rutledge, 460 U.S. 719, 75 L. Ed. 2d "
447,413," , 103 S. Ct. 1483 (1983)). However, plaintiff has not alleged that defendants conspired to interfere with any federal court 
proceeding."
447,5," Although paragraphs 124 through 129 are set forth under the caption ""ETHNIC BIAS BY LANE"", this portion of the Amended 
Complaint merely describes a verbal disagreement between plaintiff and defendant Lane. "
448,6," After the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990, codified in 28 U.S.C. § 1367, the term ""supplemental jurisdiction"" encompasses 
both ancillary and pendent jurisdiction. See Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction 317 (2d ed. 1994). "
449,7," I have not addressed defendants' arguments that plaintiff's current claims are time-barred because these claims must be 
dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, or for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. "
453,1," Defendant maintains that Plaintiff was a party to this agreement as well. Plaintiff, however, alleges that rather than endorsing 
the entire June 23, 1995 Letter Agreement, thereby ""implementing the settlement that had been reached by all parties,"" it 
specifically acknowledged only its obligation to pay the NFL $ 20 million. ""CVC (Plaintiff) did not acknowledge any obligation 
under any other part of the Under the June 23 Letter Agreement, including the cryptic reference to our settlement.'"" (Plaintiff's 
Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Settlement) (hereinafter ""Memo in Opposition""), P. 
6). "
454,2," Specifically, Plaintiff seeks, ""…compensation for the damages which they have incurred as a result of the long-standing 
conspiracy and anticompetitive conduct by the NFL and its member teams to restrict and impede the development of full, fair 
and free market for stadiums offering their facilities to major league professional football teams with the United States."" 
(Plaintiff's Complaint, P1)."
454,3," Alternatively, Defendants asset that as a third party beneficiary, the NFL is entitled to enforce the agreement between the 
Rams and Plaintiff not to sue the NFL. (Memo in Support, PP. 16-18). "
459,1," Plaintiff has also complained of violations of the Louisiana Monopolies Law, La. R.S. 51:123 et seq., and the Louisiana Unfair 
Trade Practices Act, La. R.S. 51:1405."
459,2,"  The commission may enter into a special services agreement with a hospital management firm or hospitals to manage, 
operate, and administer a hospital or hospitals, or any part thereof, under the control of the commission for the benefit of 
the hospital service district. La. R.S. 46:1055(B). "
460,3," The Mississippi statute permitted the hospitals: To contract by way of lease . . . or otherwise, with any agency, department or other office of government or any individual, 
partnership, corporation, owner, other board of trustees, or other health care facility, for the providing of property, 
equipment or services by or to the community hospital or other entity or regarding any facet of the . . . operation of the 
community hospital."" Miss. Code Ann. § 41-13-35(g). "
461,4," ""'Hospital health services' means but is not limited to any clinical, diagnostic, or rehabilitation service and any administrative, 
managerial, or operational service incident thereto."" La. R.S. 46:1072(1). "
462,5," In the pleadings, St. Luke's raises the issue of the distinctness of the two entities in the context of its argument that North Oaks 
and Quorum possess the ability to conspire. This assertion is not the same as suggesting that the two have independent 
economic interests; in fact, it would suggest just the opposite. However, the court makes no finding on the question of whether 
these two entities had the ability to conspire, or did conspire, because, finding that defendants are immune from federal antitrust 
laws, it does not reach the substantive merits of the antitrust claims."
462,6," Namely, the Louisiana Monopolies Law, La. R.S. 51:123 et seq. and the Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act, La. R.S. 
51:1405. "
469,1," The court finds it unnecessary to rule on Defendant American Way Motor's argument that the Sherman Act's four-year statute 
of limitations bars Plaintiffs' claim. See Cantor Fitzgerald. L.P. v. Peaslee, 88 F.3d 152, 155 (2d Cir. 1996) (considerations of 
judicial economy permit a court to avoid a subject-matter jurisdiction determination when the case may be disposed of on a 
simpler ground). "
472,2," HN11[
] Another exception to the parol evidence rule is if the contract was obtained through fraudulent actions or words. 
Thus, agreements and negotiations prior to or contemporaneous with the adoption of a writing are admissible to show illegality 
or fraud. See McMillin v. Great Southern Corp., 63 Tenn. App. 732, 480 S.W.2d 152, 155 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1972). Although 
Plaintiffs do allege that they relied on Mr. Mazzitelli's promise in modifying their purchase agreement with the previous owners of 
the Honda dealership, (Am. Compl. P 17), they do not allege fraud in the inducement of the sales and service agreement with 
American Honda Motor Company. Although the parol evidence rule would permit evidence concerning the representations of a 
party made prior to the signing of a contract in a fraudulent inducement claim, the rule bars such evidence when the cause of 
action is merely breach of contract.  Lowe v. Gulf Coast Dev. Inc., 1991 Tenn. App. LEXIS 860, 1991 WL 220576, at *5 (Tenn. 
Ct. App. Nov. 1, 1991). "
476,1," Whenever the court refers to ""defendants"" the reference is to both Insurers and Intracorp."
476,2," Although filed and pleaded as a class action, plaintiffs have yet to seek class certification."
476,3," Plaintiffs have characterized the conspiracy as a horizontal conspiracy of the hub and spoke variety (Doc. 50 at 4 Wash. 324, 
30 P 81; Doc. 401 at 29). The court therefore analyzes it as such. Horizontal conspiracies involve agreements among 
competitors at the same level of competition to restrain  [*8] trade. Crane & Shovel Sales Corp. v. Bucyrus-Erie Co., 854 F.2d 
802, 805 (6th Cir. 1988). "
477,4," No party has separately treated the claims based on Kansas law. Insurers have asserted that Kansas law tracks Federal law 
(Doc. 64 at 15 n.6), and plaintiffs have not disputed this. The language of Kan. Stat. Ann. §§ 50-101 & -132 persuades this court 
that state and federal law are functionally equivalent, as applied to this case. Adams Parker Furniture, Inc. v. Ethan Allen, Inc., 
No. 86-2113, 1987 WL 56676 at *4 (D. Kan. Oct. 13, 1987), 1989-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) P 68606; Fisher v. Balzer, 1991-2 Trade 
Cas. (CCH) P 69-507 (D. Kan. 1991). Accordingly, this court finds that the federal authorities cited in this Memorandum and 
order are persuasive authority on Kansas law as well, and that Kansas law should be given like construction."
477,5," Throughout this Memorandum and Order the court will use ""Insurers' Statement,"" followed by a number, to reference 
individually numbered paragraphs in the Statement of Facts appearing in insurers' memorandum in support of summary 
judgment. Likewise, ""Intracorp Statement,"" followed by a number, will reference Intracorp's numbered  [*9] paragraphs in its 
Statement of Facts. To avoid confusion the court will use ""Fact P,"" followed by a number, to reference plaintiffs' numbered 
paragraphs in their Statement of Facts. "
478,6," Market share is relevant to market power. Market power is relevant, among other things, to Insurers' motive to conspire, 
including the effect of independent action and the likelihood of the conspiracy's success. Plaintiffs allege that defendants 
intended to affect chiropractic treatment standards through their PIP insurance payment practices, that chiropractors could 
discriminate against the insureds of any individual Insurer acting unilaterally, and that the threat of competition from other 
insurance companies made unilateral action impracticable."
478,7," Though it appears that state Farm may have done this in Indiana, and Shelter in Kansas."
478,8," State Farm's usage was minimal and ceased shortly after Intracorp's concurrent review program began. While Farmers did 
contract with Intracorp for concurrent review of chiropractic' claims from many other states, it did not do so for Kansas claims. 
Shelter subscribed to TCR only between January and August of 1992. Thus, Farm Bureau, Shelter, and Trinity were 
simultaneously using Intracorp's concurrent review plan, TCR, for at least eight months, January through August of 1992. "
479,9," There is evidence, mentioned in the Appendix, that one patient believed Shelter, at the recommendation of Intracorp, precluded 
him from obtaining necessary services."
479,10," Each Insurer contracted with Intracorp at different points in time and for different durations. The fact remains, however, that for 
at least three continuous years, 1/1989 - 1/1992, all Insurers were contracting with Intracorp for some of their retrospective 
review services. Insurers point out that for some of them the decision to use Intracorp's services was made locally rather than centrally. This 
distinction is not necessarily fatal to plaintiffs' allegation of agreement. If plaintiffs could demonstrate that local agents of Insureds 
entered into the alleged agreement with Intracorp, the actions of those agents bind the Insurers provided the agents were acting 
within the scope of their authority and on behalf of their respective employers. The distinction is relevant, if at all, to issues of 
scope of the conspiracy, market share, effectiveness, motive, and damages. In any case, Insurers' evidence establishes only that Farm Bureau, Farmers, Shelter, and State Farm each maintained multiple 
claims branches across the state, and that each of these branches was responsible for deciding whether to retain Intracorp to 
review chiropractic bills. Insurers have  [*17] not established that any of those offices opted not to retain Intracorp."
479,11," There is no evidence regarding which survey, if any, the other insurers consulted to evaluate the reasonableness of 
chiropractic claims not referred to Intracorp. "
480,12," Farmers also used the eightieth percentile. Plaintiffs fail to cite any evidence indicating which percentile state Farm employed 
 [*19] on in-house reviews."
480,13," This is not to say Insurers uniformly viewed charges in excess of the eightieth percentile of Fee Facts as unreasonable, a logic 
error plaintiffs seem to make. The fact that all x are y does not mean that non-x are not y. The fact that charges at or below the 
eightieth percentile of Fee Facts are deemed reasonable does not mean that charges exceeding the eightieth percentile are not 
deemed reasonable. Plaintiffs' direct evidence only establishes that Insurers viewed charges at or below the eightieth percentile 
of Fee Facts as reasonable, not the converse. Logic cannot supply the missing link."
480,14," There were three meetings with the Kansas Insurance Commissioner. The first meeting occurred in July of 1991. Agents of all 
Insurers except Trinity, Intracorp, several other insurance companies, and the Kansas Chiropractic Association (""KCA"") 
attended. At this meeting the participants discussed the use of the eightieth percentile. After this meeting an agent of Farmers 
contacted a representative of American Family Insurance Company, and, separately, a representative of State Farm about the 
fee review processes used by those companies. The second meeting occurred on January 9, 1992. All defendants  [*22] except Trinity attended, along with representatives from 
KCA and the Commissioner's office. Insurers inquired whether KCA would endorse Fee Facts. The third meeting occurred in April of 1992. The only attendees were representatives of State Farm, the Commissioner's office, 
and the KCA. State Farm intended to obtain KCA recognition that one or more fee surveys was valid and accurate and RCA 
acceptance of a percentile for payment on those surveys. "
481,15," In fact, the court is unclear what plaintiffs contend the contours of the alleged treatment cut-off are. At various times plaintiffs 
have spoken in terms of a ninety day treatment cut-off (Doc. 401 at 11, 12 & 38), a thirty session cut-off (id. at 12 & 38), a 
twenty-five to thirty session cut-off (id. at 2 & 24), and a twenty-two to twenty-eight session cut-off (Doc. 50 at PP 59-64), and 
have implied a 26 session cut-off (Doc. 401 at 21 & 21 n.95-110). They have even referenced  [*24] a twenty-five session cut-off 
allegedly used by a non-party claims review company (Doc. 401 at 11 P 21)."
481,16," In addition to the points made by defendants, the court notes another defect in plaintiffs' proof. Plaintiffs assert that defendants 
uniformly denied payment for treatment according to this ""schedule"" (Doc. 401 at 16). They say, ""Adherence to this schedule is 
demonstrated in the bills that were in fact cut."" Restricted to the evidence actually supplied by plaintiffs, the statement should 
read, ""Adherence to this schedule is demonstrated by seventeen bills, dating between March, 1987 and January, 1988, that 
Intracorp reviewed and recommended be cut."" There is no evidence those seventeen bills actually were cut. "
482,17," The percentage of claims reduced to a particular number of sessions follow (number of sessions: percent of claims): 0-19:28; 
20:5; 21:3; 22-22.5:6; 23:2; 24:8; 25:7; 26:6; 27:2; 28:8; 29:2; 30:5; 31+:18. "
483,18," Areeda's treatise is a recognized authority on antitrust law. The Tenth circuit has cited it with approval on numerous 
occasions. "
484,19," As noted, plaintiffs have asserted differing visitation limits. At various times plaintiffs have alleged or implied that the cut-off 
was a ninety day treatment  [*35] cut-off, a thirty session cut-off, a twenty-five to thirty session cut-off, a twenty-six session cut-
off, and a twenty-two to twenty-eight session cut-off. They have even referenced a twenty-five session cut-off allegedly used by 
a non-party. "
486,20," With respect to a thirty session or ninety day treatment cut-off, plaintiffs' only evidence is Barr's affidavit, and it is insufficient to 
show either parallel conduct or evidence of a cut-off. The data she analyzes shows only a gradual relationship between the 
number of treatment sessions and the likelihood of a cut. This is to be expected irrespective of the existence of a per se cut-off 
or the alleged conspiracy. The affidavit shows no pronounced spike in the likelihood of a reduction at the thirty session or 
 [*44] ninety day marks, and there is no clustering of reduced claims at the thirty session mark that would indicate Insurers were 
attempting to cram treatment below a defined level. "
487,21," While the parallel conduct at issue involves Insurers' common use of Intracorp, and while Intracorp's service to each Insurer 
was identical, Xntracorp's conduct did not parallel that of insurers. Plaintiffs have presented no circumstantial evidence 
implicating Intracorp. Further, they have argued no motive applicable to Intracorp. As a result, Intracorp is entitled to summary 
judgment irrespective of the court's analysis of the parallel conduct issue as it applies to insurers."
487,22," Again, eightieth and ninetieth percentiles correlate to the figure at or below which eighty and ninety percent of chiropractors 
charge for a given service in a given area. "
488,23," As mentioned, the alleged conspiracy creates no disincentive, and possibly an incentive, to chiropractors charging below the 
eightieth percentile to raise prices. As they do so, the average charge will rise and will eventually surpass the pre-conspiracy 
average. "
489,24, The evidence shows that Insurers frequently do  [*52] pay above the eightieth percentile on claims reviewed in-house.
489,25, The court wonders how this could be done without an agreement or conspiracy between chiropractors. 
491,26," Kansas belongs to a minority of jurisdictions that do not recognize the tort of bad faith in insurance cases. See Associated 
Wholesale Grocers, Inc. v. Americold Corp., 261 Kan. 806, 845, 934 P.2d 65, 89-90 (1997). In Kansas, an action for damages 
for breach of an insurer's implied duty of good faith is contractual in nature. Id. at 842, 934 P.2d at 87-88. Although the duty of 
good faith and fair dealing  [*62] in insurance contracts is generally stated in broad terms, William M. Shernoff et al., Insurance 
Bad Faith Litigation § 2.01 (1996), Kansas courts have spoken with more circumspection, perhaps as a result of the distinction in 
the nature of the action. Kansas cases recognizing the duty of good faith in insurance contracts refer specifically to liability 
insurers or to the duty to investigate, to defend, or to settle. See Associated Wholesale Grocers. Inc., 261 Kan. at 845, 934 P.2d 
at 89-90; Bollinger v. Nuss, 202 Kan. 326, 332-33, 449 P.2d 502 (1969). "
492,," The type of bad faith litigation plaintiffs advance as a motive for the conspiracy is litigation either by chiropractors against 
insureds for failure to pay for contractually provided services or by insureds against Insurers for failure to pay reasonable 
charges for necessary care. In either case, the Insurer's liability, if any, is pursuant to the PIP portion of an automobile liability 
policy. That portion of the policy is most analogous to a health insurance policy. As a result, it is not at all clear under Kansas law 
that an insurer's good or bad faith is relevant in PIP cases where the issue is purely one of coverage and does not  [*63] involve 
failure to investigate, defend, or settle a liability claim. See Associated Wholesale Grocers. Inc., 261 Kan. at 831 & 845, 934 P.2d 
at 80 & 89-90 (""While the insurer's good faith obligation to settle is implied, the insurer's coverage obligations are set forth in the 
policy. When an insurer wrongfully denies coverage, the insurer breaches an express contract provision."" & ""While good or bad 
faith may be irrelevant to whether an insurer has breached its coverage obligation, it becomes relevant when the insurer bases 
its rejection of a policy limits settlement offer on coverage denial.""); see also George R. Winchell, Inc. v. Norris, 6 Kan. App. 2d 
725, 730, 633 P.2d 1174, rev. denied 230 Kan. 817 (1981) (holding in a failure to defend case that bad faith was irrelevant under 
the policy at issue because the insurer's duty to defend was expressly stated). "
497,27," Plaintiffs have not, however, presented Exhibit 4110 as an attachment to an affidavit or as an exhibit to a deposition. The 
importance of this failure is discussed below. "
501,28," Plaintiffs do not present Exhibit 801 as an attachment to an affidavit or as a deposition exhibit. The significance of this 
omission is addressed later in this Memorandum and Order."
501,29," As with Exhibit 801 above, plaintiffs do not introduce Exhibit 4148 as an attachment to an affidavit or as a deposition 
 [*96] exhibit. "
502,30," Plaintiffs fail to present these exhibits as attachments to an explanatory affidavit or as exhibits to explanatory deposition 
testimony. "
503,31, Exhibit 8 does not appear as an attachment to an affidavit or as an exhibit to a deposition.
503,32, Neither Exhibit 1 nor 2 appear as an attachment to an affidavit or as an exhibit to a deposition. 
505,33," Neither supporting exhibit, numbers 558 and 558A, appear as an attachment to an affidavit or as an exhibit to a deposition. "
506,34, None of these exhibits appear as an attachment to an affidavit or as an exhibit to a deposition.
506,35, Document 087 does not appear as an attachment to an explanatory affidavit or deposition; it is therefore difficult to be certain. 
507,36," This accords with the plain language of Rule 56(e), which reads, in pertinent part, as follows: ""Supporting and opposing 
affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show 
affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein sworn or certified copies of all papers or parts 
thereof referred to in an affidavit shall be attached thereto or served therewith."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); see also  [*117] D. Kan. R. 
56.1 P 3. "
508,37," Indeed, the evidence does not establish that he worked for all five Insurers. "
550,**," The Honorable Helen W. Gillmor, United States District Judge for the District of Hawaii, sitting by designation. "
552,1," The district court excused two jurors during deliberations and thus only ten jurors deliberated on the final verdict. One juror was 
dismissed, over Kodak's objection, for disrupting the jury's deliberations. A second juror was dismissed by agreement of both 
parties and the district court."
552,2," Section 2 of the Sherman Act reads in relevant part: HN2[
] ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce . . . [commits a felony]."" 15 U.S.C. 
§ 2. "
554,3," HN18[
] The Supreme Court has held that its precedent relating to the ""line of commerce"" under § 7 of the Clayton Act 
applies to market definition under the ""part of commerce"" language in the Sherman Act. Grinnell, 384 U.S. at 573. "
555,4," Kodak also argues, citing American Bearing Co., Inc. v. Litton Indus., 729 F.2d 943, 950 (3d Cir. 1984), that the ISOs waived 
any theory regarding ""cluster markets"" by failing to submit a jury instruction covering this ""exception"" to the interchangeability 
requirement. In American Bearing, the Third Circuit rejected the appellant's attempt to argue a different market theory on appeal. 
The ISOs do not posit a different market theory here; they continue to rely on their ""all parts"" theory. "
557,5," Contrary to the ISOs' argument, the Kodak Court's criticism of simultaneous entry barriers to parts and service did not lessen 
the requirements for showing market power; rather, the Court's statement foreclosed Kodak's argument that prevention of ISO 
free-riding on its investment in parts justified its actions as a matter of law. 504 U.S. at 485. "
561,6," Jury Instruction No. 28 states in relevant part: Exclusionary conduct refers to practices that unreasonably or unnecessarily impede fair competition; that is, conduct that 
impairs the efforts of others to compete for customers in an unnecessarily restrictive way. Such conduct does not refer to 
ordinary means of competition, like offering better products or services, exercising superior skill or business judgment, 
utilizing more efficient technology, or exercising natural competitive advantages. "
564,7," In 1988, Congress amended the patent laws to provide that ""no patent owner otherwise entitled to relief for infringement . . . of 
a patent shall be denied relief or deemed guilty of misuse or illegal extension of the patent right by reason of . . . (4) [the patent 
owner's] refusal to license or use any rights to the patent."" HN50[
] 35 U.S.C. § 271(d) (1988). The First Circuit has observed that this amendment ""may even herald the prohibition of all antitrust claims . . . premised on a 
refusal to license a patent."" Data General, 36 F.3d at 1187 (citing Richard Calkins, ""Patent Law: The Impact of the 1988 Patent 
Misuse Reform Act and Noerr-Pennington Doctrine on Misuse Defenses and Antitrust Counterclaims,"" 38 Drake L. Rev. 175, 
192-97 (1988-89)). The amended statutory language does not compel this result, and Calkins and other commentators agree 
that § 271(d)(4) merely codified existing law. See Calkins, 38 Drake L. Rev. at 197; 5 Donald S. Chisum, Patents, § 19.04[1] at 
19-295 (1992) (""The 'refusal to license' provision received little attention in the floor statements, primarily because the provision 
was intended to codify existing law.""). The amendment does, however, indicate congressional intent to protect the core patent 
right of exclusion. "
565,8," The cases cited by the Supreme Court also support this conclusion. In Times-Picayune, the Court addressed both a § 1 tying 
claim and a § 2 monopolization claim.  345 U.S. at 611. Regarding the § 1 claim, the Court found insufficient power in the 
relevant market to support ""dominance."" Id. Later in addressing the § 2 claim, the Supreme Court held that ""this case does not 
demonstrate an attempt by a monopolist established in one area to nose into a second market . . . ."" Id. at 626. Also relevant to the relationship between § 1 and § 2, the Court in Leitch Manufacturing held that it made no difference that the 
defendant had not expanded its monopoly ""by contract."" 302 U.S. at 463. The Court held: HN57[
] The owner of the patent monopoly, ignoring the limitation 'inherent in the patent grant,' sought by its method of 
doing business to extend the monopoly to unpatented material . . . . [This is unlawful] whatever the nature of the device by which the owner of the patent seeks to effect such unauthorized 
extension of the monopoly. Id. (citation omitted); see also Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Investment Co., 320 U.S. 661, 665, 88 L. Ed. 376, 64 S. Ct. 268

v. Rohm & Haas, 448 U.S. 176, 65 L. Ed. 2d 696, 100 S. Ct. 2601 (1980), but this does not alter the application of their 
reasoning here."
565,9," The ISOs correctly observe that this case involves a selective refusal to sell products protected by patents and copyrights, not 
an absolute refusal to license. This distinction makes no difference. See Westinghouse, 648 F.2d at 647 (""the right to license . . . 
exclusively or otherwise . . . is the 'untrammeled right' of the patentee.""). The ISOs offer no rationale for a distinction between 
discriminatory licensing and discriminatory sales. "
566,10," The ISOs withdrew their tying claim. The ISOs' Amici, National Electronics Service Dealers Association and Professional 
Service Association, argue that the record reflects concerted action by Kodak, but the jury instructions do not define such action 
and we should not presume that it was found. HN64[
] - "
567,11," That antitrust claims may cut into the core rights conferred by patents and copyrights is illustrated by the injunction imposed by 
the district court here. The injunction requires that Kodak supply all ISOs with its patented and copyrighted materials at 
""reasonable prices."" Even the ISOs do not dispute that Kodak is entitled to reap monopoly prices from the sale or licensing of 
these materials. "
569,12," In Jury Instruction No. 34, the jury was instructed that, if they ""find that any Kodak business reason"" is a legitimate business 
reason, in that it ""furthers competition on the merits, reduces prices, enhances the quality or attractiveness of a product, 
increases efficiency by reducing costs or otherwise benefits consumers,"" they ""should then consider whether each such reason 
is pretextual - in other words, not a genuine reason for Kodak's conduct."" "
571,13," Kodak does not point to evidence showing that MSI's president based his 50% earnings growth estimate on pre-1986 
equipment. "
572,14," Although Neches' calculation of the equipment available to service in different markets might have been skewed by failing to 
take equipment under point-of-sale contracts into account, certain exhibits show that these contracts were taken into account in 
his market calculation."
572,15," MSI's president factored in a 20% ""attrition rate"" in order to account for new competition. MSI's projected growth rate for the 
relevant period was less than the other ISOs. "
573,16," The ISOs' argument that they were entitled to recover damages under a more general ""proximate cause"" instruction also 
founders on this untenable distinction. HN83[
] -"
573,17," Counsel informed this court, by letter dated February 24, 1997, of an amendment to the district court's injunction. We 
recommend that the district court review that amendment in light of the modifying language set forth below. "
574,18," The injunction limits this requirement where ""the ISOs or vendors are . . . causing the breach of any obligation of themselves 
or a third party not to disclose proprietary Kodak data . . . provided that the sale of a part . . . shall not be deemed to be a 
disclosure of Kodak proprietary data."" The net effect is to require the sale of parts."
574,19," Forcing nondiscriminatory pricing will force Kodak to restructure its pricing policies, but this result is less onerous than direct 
price regulation."
574,20," The district court observed that the prices Kodak charges to companies like Danka and Canon, which have entered into 
servicing contracts with Kodak, provide a basis for assessing the reasonableness of Kodak prices. When the ISOs expand their 
markets, however, the demand for Kodak parts will increase, and Kodak should not be limited to its current prices. "
577,1," The facts of the instant case illustrate this problem. On February 12, 1997, after oral argument in this case, the parties and 
Danka Office Imaging Company (""Danka"") filed in the district court a stipulation stating that Kodak has sold its copier sales and 
service division to Danka. Pursuant to the stipulation of the parties and of Danka, the district court entered an order stating that 
Danka agreed to be bound by the terms of the injunction. Because the majority eliminates the provisions applying the injunction 
to Kodak's successors, the sale to Danka will deprive the ISOs of an important portion of the relief they have obtained. "

Inc. (1988) 46 Cal. 3d 1147, 1169-1170 [252 Cal. Rptr. 221, 762 P.2d 385].) According to recent authority, all that changed with addition of the two 3-letter words--""any"" and ""act."" ( Podolsky v. First

State Bar of California, Cal. Antitrust Law (Supp. 1994) § 10.01, 10.04.) Earth Elements argues that the 1992 Legislature did not intend to alter the need for ongoing conduct, pointing to language in the 
Legislative Counsel's Digest for the June 25, 1992, version of Senate Bill No. 1586 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.) as follows: ""This bill 
would also provide that where the conduct involves advertising, the publication or broadcast of the advertisement shall constitute 
a minimum of a single act of unfair competition, with as many additional violations as there are persons who are subjected to the 
advertisement, as specified. It would authorize the court to impose civil penalties, as specified, for each violation."" Senate Bill 
No. 1586, as enacted, omitted all but the last sentence of the above language from the Legislative Counsel's Digest. The plain 
meaning of the amendment, as enacted, is that the UCA now covers single acts of misconduct. In any event, the omitted 
language does not support Earth Element's contention. "

buyers. More technically, it measures the responsiveness of the demand for one product to changes in the price of a different 
product."" E. Thomas Sullivan and Jeffrey L. Harrison, Understanding Antitrust and its Economic Implications 217 (1994). "
595,7," In Mozart Co. v. Mercedes-Benz of North America, 833 F.2d 1342 (9th Cir. 1987), the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit 
observed that market power exists in three circumstances: where the government has granted a seller a patent or similar 
monopoly, where the seller possesses a unique product, or where the seller possesses a high market share.  Id. at 1345-1346. 
The court made no mention of contractual limitations as a source of market power. "
596,8," In a typical antitrust case, plaintiffs assert that the products or services in their proposed relevant market are reasonably 
interchangeable because they possess positive cross-elasticity of demand: a rise in the price of one product in the market will 
increase demand for the other items in the market. By contrast, in Kodak the defendants argued that Kodak copier parts, though 
not reasonably interchangeable with the copiers themselves, were not a relevant market because of negative cross-elasticity 
between parts and copiers: an increase in the price of parts would, they argued, decrease demand for copiers using those parts."
596,9," A franchisee considering exiting one franchise system faces information costs associated with researching alternative 
investment opportunities and switching costs stemming from the loss of invested funds that may not be recovered if it abandons 
its current business and start-up costs associated with the new venture."
596,10," If Kodak repair parts had not been unique, but rather, could be obtained from additional sources at a reasonable price, Kodak 
could not have forced copier purchasers to buy repair parts from Kodak. This would be true even if the copier purchasers faced 
information and switching costs that locked them into to use of Kodak copiers. This fact indicates that switching and information 
costs alone cannot create market power. Rather, it is the lack of a competitive market in the object to be purchased -- for 
instance, a competitive market in Kodak parts -that gives a company market power."

598,16," The dissent contends Domino's has acted in a ""predatory way."" But plaintiffs may have a right to sue for breach of contract."
598,17," The reasoning adopted by the district court in this case has been criticized recently by two other district court decisions. See 
Wilson v. Mobil Oil Corp., 940 F. Supp. 944 (E.D. La. 1996); Collins v. International Dairy Queen, Inc., 939 F. Supp. 875 (M.D. 
Ga. 1996). In Wilson, the court disagreed with the district court's interpretation of Kodak, arguing that under Kodak information 
and switching costs alone, absent a unique product or service, may create a relevant market for antitrust purposes. As noted 
above, we disagree with this interpretation, for the Supreme Court specifically found that the copier parts involved in the case 
were unique. The basis of the Collins court's criticism of the district court's decision here is less clear, though it appears the court 
believed that the district court's holding was too expansive. The Collins court apparently wished to reserve judgment whether 
some franchise tying arrangements might be deemed anti-competitive in the future. The approach taken by the district court in 
this case has received support in recent scholarly literature. See Alan J. Meese, Antitrust Balancing in a (Near) Coasean World: 
The Case of Franchise Tying Contracts, 95 Mich. L. Rev. 111, 128 (1996) (""economic theory suggests . . . that tying contracts 
that actually reduce free riding are unrelated to any exercise of market power""); Alan H. Silberman, The Myths of Franchise 
""Market Power"", 65 Antitrust L.J. 181 (1996). "
599,18," Monopoly power under § 2 requires ""something greater"" than market power under § 1.  Kodak, 504 U.S. at 481. This does not 
imply, however, that the analyses employed in the two types of cases to define relevant markets differ. In the past, we intimated 
that the relevant market analysis required under § 2 of the Sherman Act was ""instructive"" in § 1 cases, though perhaps not 
identical. See Tunis Bros., 952 F.2d at 724 n. 3. The Supreme Court and lower courts have consistently held that relevant 
markets under both sections are defined by the same two factors: reasonable interchangeability of use and cross-elasticities of 
demand. See, e.g., Allen-Myland , 33 F.3d at 201 and 201 n. 8 (applying Brown Shoe relevant market test of reasonable 
interchangeability and cross-elasticity of demand in § 1 tying case). In this case, we see no difference in the relevant market 
analyses required under the two provisions. "
601,1," The district court relied on ""two influential commentators,"" Benjamin Klein and Lester F. Saft, The Law and Economics of 
Franchise Tying Contracts, 28 J.L. & Econ. 345, 356 (1985) and two pre-Kodak cases, Mozart Co. v. Mercedes-Benz of North 
America, Inc. , 833 F.2d 1342 (9th Cir. 1987), and Tominaga v. Shepard, 682 F. Supp. 1489 (C.D. Cal. 1988). The district court 
adopted the Ninth Circuit's analysis from Mozart that an alleged economic-lock-in is irrelevant to the determination of a 
defendant's market power. See Tominaga, 682 F. Supp. at 1494 (quoting Mozart, 833 F.2d at 1346-47). This reasoning is simply 
irreconcilable with the Supreme Court's analysis of information and switching costs in Kodak. See Kodak, 504 U.S. at 473-77. It should also be noted Professor Klein recognized, contrary to his original thesis, that Kodak permits the recognition of market 
power in a derivative aftermarket ""despite the absence of market power in the equipment market, by taking advantage of 
imperfectly informed consumers that become 'locked-in' to their existing Kodak equipment."" See Benjamin Klein, Market Power 
in Antitrust: Economic Analysis After Kodak, 3 Sup. Ct. Econ. Rev. 43, 48 (1993)."
601,2," The basic definition of market power is ""the power to raise prices above competitive levels without losing so many sales that 
the price increase is unprofitable."" Herbert Hovenkamp, Federal Antitrust Policy: The Law of Competition and its Practice § 3.1, 
at 79 (1994) (footnote omitted). "
602,3," The majority, in footnote 17, ante at 20, states that the district court's approach has ""received support in recent scholarly 
literature,"" citing Alan J. Meese, Antitrust Balancing in a (Near) Coasean World: The Case of Franchise Tying Contracts, 95 
Mich. L. Rev. 111, 128 (1996). However, Professor Meese does not argue that the approach taken is correct under current 
antitrust law. In fact, on page 126 he concedes that the Kodak decision ""found that the existence of relationship-specific 
investments can confer 'market power' "", and at 152-55 he states that ""under current law"" franchisors may have market power 
over derivative aftermarkets due to ""lock-in"" of the franchisees, and because of this he proposes a new framework for analyzing 
such claims. He argues that ""the focus on market power and less restrictive alternatives, though perfectly natural given the 
partial equilibrium framework that dominates antitrust law and the premises that underlie tying jurisprudence,"" does not properly 
apply to the franchise tying context.  Id. at 128. Professor Meese argues that tying contracts that reduce free riding, a form of 
opportunistic behavior taken at the expense of the franchise system, should be prima facie legal. Whatever the value of 
Professor Meese's argument, he presupposes that ""under current law"" from the Supreme Court the district court in this case may 
have erred.  Id. at 152. In addition, it is not even clear that Professor Meese would find the plaintiffs' allegations insufficient as a 
matter of law because they allege that DPI charged supracompetitive prices for the ingredients and supplies. See id. at 155."
602,4," This conclusion seems quite sensible. If Kodak customers knew about Kodak's subsequent parts-and-service policy when they 
bought the copiers, or were not economically restricted from switching to other copiers, then Justice Scalia's dissent, which 
assumes a perfect competition/perfect information world, should be right. Kodak is merely a concession to fact that markets do 
not always work perfectly, and sometimes, but not always, these imperfections can create sufficient market power to justify 
possible antitrust liability. "
603,5," In Market Power in Aftermarkets: Antitrust Policy and the Kodak Case, 40 U.C.L.A. L. Rev. 1447 (1993), Professor Hovenkamp 
argues that whether a product requires ""unique"" replacement parts is absolutely irrelevant to whether the manufacturer of that 
product has market power. He states that the portion of the Kodak opinion about unique parts is wrong, but that the evidence 
cited of increased prices was relevant to the question of market power.  Id. at 1454-55."
603,6," For example, if someone patented a new material for bottling soft drinks, it would certainly be true that there were no other 
materials just like it. But, provided glass and plastic were still reasonable substitutes, the description ""unique"" would not be 
meaningful for antitrust analysis. "
604,7," The majority cities United Farmers Agents v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, 89 F.3d 233 (5th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 136 L. Ed. 2d 
846, 117 S. Ct. 960 (1997), for the argument that a derivative aftermarket defined by contractual restraints must be rejected. 
However, this case does not stand for the proposition for which it is cited. In United Farmers, the 5th Circuit does cite the 
statement from Professors Klein and Saft, that the economic power derived from contractual agreements has nothing to do with 
market power for purposes of antitrust. 89 F.3d at 236-7. However, the court proceeded to expressly address whether there 
were sufficient information and switching costs to justify invoking Kodak and upholding the plaintiffs' alleged relevant market. The 
district court in Wilson addressed the importance of the United Farmers opinion and concluded: ""If anything, this decision 
suggests that when parties seek to invoke Kodak, issues of information costs and switching costs must be addressed before 
tying claims can be rejected out of hand."" Wilson, 940 F. Supp. at 952."
604,8," It is alleged the DPI's Offering Circular represented to prospective franchisees that DPI would approve a sufficient number of 
suppliers to ensure a competitive aftermarket for ingredients and supplies, and that it would only utilize its approval power to 
maintain quality control. "
605,9," Moreover, the majority's analysis, that what the plaintiffs knew when they entered the franchise agreement is an important 
distinguishing factor, concedes that imperfect information is a crucial factor in determining relevant market definition. "
615,1," Defendants filed two motions to dismiss. The first motion seeks to dismiss the R.I.C.O. allegations in counts 1-3 of the First 
Amended Complaint. The second motion seeks dismissal of the balance of the State's claims, being counts 4-14 of the First

617,3," It should be noted that Texas state courts have also recognized that quasi-sovereign interests allow states to bring actions 
where the health and welfare of its people are at stake. See Bachynsky v. State, 747 S.W.2d 868 (Tex. App.--Dallas 1988 
denied) (discussing the principles enunciated in Snapp)."
617,4," The Defendants have also alleged that the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Standard Oil Co., 332 U.S. 301, 91 L. 
Ed. 2067, 67 S. Ct. 1604 (1947), forecloses the State's action to recover medical expenses. In Standard Oil, the Court held that 
the federal government could not recover funds expended to treat a soldier that had been injured in an accident that involved the 
defendant. The Court stated that there was not a federal common law right to bring a direct action against the defendant.  Id. at 
314. The Court is not persuaded that Standard Oil controls this case. First, it involved the federal government rather than a state. The 
Court notes that quasi-sovereign interests have never been held to be the basis for a suit brought by the federal government. "
618,," However, as noted above, the Supreme Court has recognized that the States have such interests. Second, quasi-sovereign 
interests only arise when a significant portion of the populace is affected. See Snapp, at 607. Standard Oil, only involved one 
citizen. Clearly this would not give rise to a cause of action based on quasi-sovereign interests."

circumstances, the right to proceed under the common law. Defendants' Reply Brief in Support of Their Motion to Dismiss, at p.

expenditures at issue in this case, ""it would not have been necessary for the Texas legislature to 'create' a cause of action . . ."" 
Defendants Brief in Support of Their Motion to Dismiss, at p. 12. There is a simple answer for the Defendants' concern. The

efforts are not cost effective)."
619,7," In this matter, § 32.033 is entitled ""Subrogation."" However, the State is correct that the title of the statute alone does not 
support a conclusion that subrogation is the only remedy available. See TEX. GOV'T. CODE ANN. § 311.024 (stating that the 
title of a statute does not expand or limit the meaning of the statute)."
619,8, See 42 U.S.C. § 2651. 
620,9," The Court should mention that there has been a great deal of discussion regarding the language of § 32.033(d), quoted above.

State with an independent direct action and § 32.033 does not supplant it."

this claim. "

counsel. Judging by the substance of defendants' arguments, I take it that defendants place primary reliance upon Rule 12(b)(1), 
which provides for the dismissal of a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. "
641,4," In addition to citing Timberlane I as precedent for a comity balancing test, the Second Circuit also cited Mannington Mills, Inc. 
v. Congoleum Corp., 595 F.2d 1287 (3d Cir. 1979)."
641,5, An appeal is pending before the Second Circuit.
641,6," Having considered all the factors, Judge Conner decided on the particular facts of the case to exercise antitrust jurisdiction. "
642,7," In Hartford Fire Insurance, the Supreme Court affirmed the Ninth Circuit in part, reversed it in part, and remanded the case.  
509 U.S. at 799. I need not, for the sake of this opinion, describe the other issues involved in the case. "
644,8," The Second Circuit in Maxwell also referred to Hartford Fire Insurance's statement that ""'other concerns' might be implicated if 
the context were different,"" 93 F.3d at 1049, citing its prior opinion in Sterling Drug as an example."
644,9," In considering whether the United States Bankruptcy Code should be given extraterritorial effect, the Second Circuit cited and 
quoted § 403(2) of the Restatement in stating: Whether so legislating would be ""unreasonable"" is determined ""by evaluating all relevant factors, including, where 
appropriate, ""such factors as the link between the regulating state and the relevant activity, the connection between that 
state and the person responsible for the activity (or protected by the regulation), the nature of the regulated activity and its 
importance to the regulating state, the effect of the regulation on justified expectations, the significance of the regulation to 
the international system, and the likelihood of conflict with other states' regulations. In re Maxwell Communication Corp., 93 F.3d at 1048. I think it clear from Judge Cardamone's preceding discussion, 93 F.3d at 
1047, that in the context of the Maxwell case these factors would apply to both doctrines that may be embraced by the concept 
of international comity: ""as a canon of construction,"" shortening ""the reach of a statute,"" and ""as a discretionary act of deference 
by a national court to decline to exercise jurisdiction in a case properly adjudicated in a foreign state, the so-called comity among 
courts."" Since it is well established that the Sherman Act has extraterritorial effect if the conduct abroad has sufficient intended 
impact upon American commerce, the case at bar turns upon the second of these two conceptual doctrines. "
645,10," One must also not lose sight of the fact that in Maxwell the Second Circuit looked to Hartford Fire Insurance in articulating the 
true conflict requirement, although Maxwell arose under the Bankruptcy Code, and not the Sherman Act. "
646,11," That factor is reminiscent of the Second Circuit's concerns about the extraterritorial breadth of the district court's injunction in 
Sterling Drug."
646,12," 15 U.S.C. § 6a reads in full: Sections 1 to 7 of this title shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce (other than import trade or import 
commerce) with foreign nations unless-- (1) such conduct has a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect-- (A) on trade or commerce which is not trade or commerce with foreign nations, or on import trade or import commerce 
with foreign nations; or (B) on export trade or export commerce with foreign nations, of a person engaged in such trade or commerce in the 
United States; and (2) such effect gives rise to a claim under the provisions of sections 1 to 7 of this title, other than this section. If sections 1 to 7 of this title apply to such conduct only because of the operation of paragraph (1)(B), then section 1 to 7 of this 
title shall apply to such conduct only for injury to export business in the United States. "
648,13," While American courts are not infrequently required to determine foreign law, usually after considering diametrically opposing 
opinions submitted by qualified foreign advocates, the typical case, unlike that at bar, does not involve ongoing litigation in the 
foreign country involving the same claims and issues."
648,14," If Filetech succeeds on the legal theories asserted in France, most recently in the form of the French magistrate's indictment of 
France Telecom, there is no reason to suppose that the French courts would not grant to Filetech appropriate injunctive relief, of 
the sort Filetech seeks in this Court. "
649,15," I express no view with respect to the economic, social, or spiritual virtues or vices of direct mail marketing. The purpose of the 
discussion in text is simply to set forth the practical realities of the case."
649,16," Because France Telecom does not specify which subsection of Rule 12(b) it is moving under, its briefs do not discuss what 
material the Court may consider in deciding the motion. If this were a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, I could not consider any evidentiary 
material outside the complaint without converting the motion into one for summary judgment under Rule 56 and giving the 
parties notice to that effect, which might require further discovery under Rule 56(f). But the Ninth Circuit has said in Metro 
Industries, 82 F.3d at 846, that while dismissal ""based upon the first two prongs"" of Timberlane I analysis (the effect upon the 
foreign commerce of the United States and its type and magnitude) ""would likely require Rule 56 treatment and an absence of a 
dispute about material facts, dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) based on comity considerations is permissible."" See also Ensign-
Bickford Co., 817 F. Supp. at 1023 (""The consideration of materials outside the complaint on a motion to dismiss pursuant to 
Rule 12(b)(1) does not convert the motion to one for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56."") (citation omitted)."
649,17," That assertion is based upon an affidavit by a France Telecom executive, Dominique Rimbault, to the effect that the subsidiary 
defendant, France Telecom Incorporated, ""has no involvement in any aspect of the marketing lists business."" Main Brief at 31. "
650,18, It is common ground that France Telecom constitutes an entity of a foreign state for FSIA purposes.
650,19," In Ensign-Bickford Co., 817 F. Supp. 1018 at 1023 n.7, Judge Cabranes, citing Third Circuit authority, Mortensen v. First 
Federal Savings & Loan Association, 549 F.2d 884, 891 (3d Cir. 1977), adopted the view that on a motion to dismiss under Rule 
12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, ""the trial court may proceed as it never could under [Rule] 12(b)(6) or Fed.R.Civ.P. 
56."" Judge Cabranes reasoned that because the issue ""in a factual 12(b)(1) motion is the trial court's jurisdiction -- its very power 
to hear the case -- . . . no presumptive truthfulness attaches to plaintiff's allegations, and the existence of disputed material facts 
will not preclude the trial court from evaluating for itself the merits of jurisdictional claims."" While this approach would grant me greater decisional latitude in the case at bar, I think it is better, even on a Rule 12(b)(1) 
motion, at least where the parties vigorously contest the existence vel non of controlling jurisdictional facts, to use the Ninth 
Circuit's approach in Metro Industries, assume the truth of plaintiffs' allegations, and test them for legal sufficiency. It follows that this Court's denial of defendants' second and third asserted grounds for dismissal are without prejudice to their 
reassertion after discovery, if the Court of Appeals reverses the dismissal of the complaint on the first ground of international 
comity. It is perhaps appropriate to add that, in clarifying that procedural point, I do not mean to suggest any lingering doubt, at 
least on my part, with respect to the conclusion that comity requires dismissal. "
654,1," The fact that personal discrimination has joined price discrimination in public consciousness certainly does not justify the 
dissent's suggestion that price discrimination has now somehow become obscure, if not entirely lost to public view."
654,2," Heileman has recently gone bankrupt and been purchased by The Stroh Brewery Company. Stroh substituted for Heileman in 
the appeal, but we will refer to Heileman and Federal for clarity's sake. Employers Mutual Insurance Company of Wausau has 
been voluntarily dismissed from the appeal by Stroh."
654,3," When the pricing plan was first announced, Heileman offered the following discount schedule: [SEE TABLE IN ORIGINAL]. Number of Cases Purchased Amount of Discount"
654,30," ,001 to 50,000 10"
654,50," ,001 to 75,000 20"
654,75," ,001+ 30 By 1991, a 50 per case discount required the purchase of at least 105,001 cases while the lowest discount, 10 per case, 
required purchase of at least 4,500 cases. By April of 1994 the breakdown was even more demanding: Number of Cases Purchased Amount of Discount "
655,4," ,500 to 19,999 10"
655,20," ,000 to 34,999 20"
655,35," ,000 to 54,999 30"
655,55," ,000 to 149,999 40"
655,150," ,000+ 50 The top number was increased again the very next month, to 160,001 cases. Calumet was Heileman's second largest 
wholesaler in Indiana, with monthly purchases averaging approximately 32,000 cases. Central Distributing purchased 
approximately 150,000 cases a month."
655,4," HN2[
] Indiana Code § 7.1-5-5-7, Sales--Discrimination by Permittee reads as follows: It is unlawful for a permittee in a sale or contract to sell alcoholic beverages to discriminate between purchasers by granting 
a price, discount, allowance, or service charge which is not available to all purchasers at the same time. However, this 
section does not authorize or require a permittee to sell to a person to whom he is not authorized to sell under the title. "
656,5," The dissent relies prominently on arguments based on the listing of ""discrimination"" under the category of ""personal injury"" and 
its grouping with the term ""humiliation."" Federal made these arguments in the district court, which rejected them, but has not 
renewed them on appeal. They do not appear in Federal's brief, and the effort of the dissent to find them somehow in the 
general structure of Federal's argument is very unconvincing. See Dis. Op. at 21 n.1. About these arguments the district court 
noted: Federal first takes the position that because the term discrimination falls under the heading ""PERSONAL INJURY"" and 
further because it is grouped with the term ""humiliation"" which is in the nature of an offense to the person, discrimination 
means ""personal discrimination"" as opposed to ""economic discrimination in business operations in violation of antitrust 
laws."" Memo. Op. at 6. The district court rejected this argument, stating that by its own terms the policy does not limit 
personal injury coverage to injuries suffered by natural persons as opposed to business entities, that ""personal injury"" is 
defined to include several injuries regularly suffered by businesses and that the insurance policy was written for a business 
entity, not for an individual, and that ""while it might appear to make little sense as a linguistic matter to conclude that 
personal injury coverage could conceivably allow recovery for an economic harm to a business, from a practical standpoint 
such coverage, where appropriate, should be available."" Memo. Op. at 7. Federal has abandoned these arguments on appeal. It is therefore puzzling that the dissent continues to rely on 
them. "
657,6," The attempt of the dissent to argue that the Robinson-Patman Act's use of the word ""discrimination"" rather than ""differentiation"" 
is fortuitous is misplaced. See Dis. Op. at 22. The Act refers to discrimination for precisely the same reasons Calumet did; 
discrimination is taking the form of price differentiation. We do not know of any statute that uses the term ""price differentiation."""
657,7," While the dissent believes our attention to the definitions of ""discrimination"" and ""price discrimination"" gives the words a 
distorted reading, see Dis. Op. at 21, we note that the definitions highlight the varied meanings of the term ""discrimination."" 
Discrimination encompasses more than the current, ten-o'clock-news version of its ""common sense"" meaning. "
658,8," We also disagree with the dissent's reliance on dictum in Curtis-Universal v. Sheboygan E.M.S. Inc., 43 F.3d 1119, 1123 (7th 
Cir. 1994); Dis. Op. at 22. The problem there was to determine the reach of the omnibus and notoriously flexible term, ""unfair 
competition."" ""Discrimination"" has a much more specific meaning, which may or may not involve the antitrust laws. Cf.  Texas & 
Pac. Ry. Co., 204 U.S. 426, 27 S. Ct. 350, 51 L. Ed. 553 (decided under Interstate Commerce Act). "
659,9," Federal responds by pointing to the occasions when the policy follows a semicolon with ""and"" ""at the ends of paragraphs and 
within sentences."" This is not the construction Heileman is arguing. In no way does Heileman assert that every semicolon in the 
policy is followed either by an ""or"" or nothing. Heileman merely points out that in a particular type of construction (alphabetic lists 
with subparts of numeric lists) the semicolon use is consistent and meaningful."
659,10," Federal's brief implies that price discrimination suits are common, as the following excerpt indicates: The ""price"" of an item includes any discounts or other terms or conditions that may result in discrimination, such as rebates, 
free goods, and discriminatory freight allowances.  Centex-Winston Corp. v. Edward Hines Lumber Co., 447 F.2d 585 (7th 
Cir. 1971); Fowler Mfg. Co. v. Gorlick, 415 F.2d 1248 (9th Cir. 1969). Forms of price discrimination that are likely to give rise to litigation (other than simple arbitrary price differences between 
different purchasers) are based on volume, quantity and functional discounts. Volume and quantity discounts, if available, 
must be offered equally to all customers and must be practically available to all customers. Fed. Trade Comm'n v. Morton 
Salt Co., 334 U.S. 37, 92 L. Ed. 1196, 68 S. Ct. 822 (1948). Federal Br. at 19-20. "
660,11," The definition reads (emphasis removed): Personal Injury Means a. false arrest, false imprisonment, wrongful eviction, wrongful entry, wrongful detention or malicious prosecution; b. libel, slander, defamation of character, or invasion of the rights of privacy, unless arising out of advertising activities; c. humiliation or discrimination . . . ."
660,12," Heileman argues that the district court misquoted the policy language: ""The court instead drops the word 'by' following the 
word 'committed' to make over the wording to read 'committed with knowledge or consent of the insured.' The court's redrafting 
is remarkable for its indifference to the actual insurance wording."" Heileman Br. at 38. We caution Heileman against impugning 
the work of the district court on what appear to be specious grounds. We find the alleged misquotation nowhere in the district 
court's opinion. We find instead two completely accurate quotations, Memo. Op. at 11, 12, and two quotations mistakenly 
inserting the word ""the."" Memo. Op. at 13 (""with the knowledge or consent of the insured"") (emphasis supplied to indicate 
incorrect word). This mistake is hardly as indifferent to the actual language (or as devious) as Heileman would have us believe. "
662,1," The majority chooses not to discuss the context of the word ""discrimination"" within the contract by concluding that Federal has 
failed to argue this point on appeal. By my reading, Federal's argument that a reasonable person would not interpret 
""discrimination,"" as used in its policy, to include ""price discrimination"" sufficiently preserves this issue. In any event, nothing, 
including the district court's rejection of this argument, precludes this court from taking note of the placement of the disputed 
term within the contract, as our review of this legal issue is de novo. "
663,2," Having concluded that Federal's policy does not cover Heileman's claim, I express no opinion regarding the majority's analysis 
of the policy's exclusionary provision. "
668,1," Relief from the United States International Trade Commission is primarily limited to prospective tariffs which are paid to the 
United States, for deposit into the general treasury, with no damages paid directly to any of the United States companies that 
may have been injured by the dumping. "

673,3," Section One of the Sherman Act generally prohibits combinations in restraint of trade and Section Two prohibits 
monopolization. See 15 U.S.C. §§ 1 & 2. "
674,4," The Third Circuit Court of Appeals reversed in part the district court's decision in Zenith Radio, finding genuine issues of fact as 
to predatory price dumping by some of the defendants. On appeal to the United States Supreme Court, the high court held as to 
the Sherman Act claims that a showing of a reasonable possibility of recoupment was required in a predatory pricing case and 
because the plaintiffs had made no such showing, reversed the Circuit on that issue. The 1916 Act issues were not addressed 
by the Supreme Court. Subsequently, on remand, the Circuit ordered the Sherman Act (Sections One and Two) claims 
dismissed and also determined in a brief statement that the Antidumping Act claims should suffer the same fate. Defendants cite 
this as authority for the proposition that the 1916 Act requires predatory pricing in all cases. As stated above, such a holding 
would be contrary to the language of the 1916 Act. To the extent that the Third Circuit so held, this court disagrees, but it 
appears more likely that the Third Circuit did not address the precise question at issue in the present case. "
676,5," Defendants refer specifically to letters written to Senator Strom Thurmond, chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on the 
Judiciary, by U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and General Counsel of the Department of Commerce Douglas Riggs 
voicing their opposition to the proposed ""Unfair Foreign Competition Act of 1985."" Defendants contend those letters support their 
view that the 1916 Act is not a protectionist act and is limited only to antitrust principles. The letters do not Support Defendants' 
position. The focus of the letters was not to express agency views on whether the 1916 Act is protectionist or antitrust in nature "
677,," but to gather information about whether various executive branch agencies supported or opposed the passage of the proposed 
act. The agencies' opposition to the passage of the proposed act was based on varying officials' conclusions that the bill was 
inconsistent with the United States' international obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (""GATT"") and 
the 1979 GATT Antidumping Code, not on their belief that the 1916 Act is an antitrust statute."

C 7888, 1995 WL 59228 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 10, 1995)."
696,4," The court held the Sherman Act inapplicable to the conduct alleged in the complaint because defendants' conduct was 
incidental to a valid effort to influence governmental action and therefore immune.  NOW v. Scheidler, 765 F. Supp. 937, 939-41 
(N.D. Ill. 1991). The court dismissed the § 1962(a) RICO claim because defendants' receipt of donations from supporters was 
not income derived from racketeering.  Id. at 941. The § 1962(c) RICO claim was dismissed because the court concluded that 
RICO requires that economic motive be alleged.  Id. at 941-44. The RICO conspiracy count was dismissed because all 
substantive RICO counts failed.  Id. at 944. Finally, the state law claims were also dismissed because the dismissal of the claims 
based on federal law destroyed the basis for jurisdiction over the state law claims.  Id. at 944-45."
696,5," In a concurring opinion, Justice Souter emphasized that although the First Amendment does not require reading an economic 
motive into the unambiguous RICO statute, legitimate free speech issues may be implicated in this case.  NOW v. Scheidler, 
510 U.S. 249, 263-65, 114 S. Ct. 798, 806-07, 127 L. Ed. 2d 99 (1994) (concurring, Souter, J.). Justice Souter advised that 
those concerns should be addressed as they arise. Id. In the instant case, such concerns have arisen via the numerous affirmative defenses asserted by the defendants. Plaintiffs have 
moved to strike these defenses. Pursuant to its order dated March 20, 1997, this court has taken up plaintiffs' motion to strike 
and defendants' motions for summary judgment concurrently. (See Memorandum Opinion and Order, NOW v. Scheidler, 86 C 
7888, of even date)."
696,6," The court specifically reaffirmed its original dismissal of the Sherman Act count and RICO § 1962(a) cause of action.  NOW v. 
Scheidler, 25 F.3d 1053, 1994 WL 196761, *2 (7th Cir. 1994) (unpublished disposition). "
697,7," Because defendants TPO are named in counts I and II only, the court considers their motion only as to those counts. Likewise, 
defendant Migliorino's motion for summary judgment is deemed to pertain to counts I through IV--the counts in which she is 
named."
697,8," Because the motions before the court were brought by a subset of the named defendants, the evidence submitted in 
connection with the motions pertains, in the main, to the members of that subset only. Accordingly, the recitation of facts 
contained herein necessarily paints an incomplete picture of the underlying lawsuit."
697,9," While Operation Rescue is not a formal legal entity, its organizational character mirrors the structure and formality of traditional 
legal entities and it enjoys a separate existence from that of defendant Terry's. (See 12(N) Pls. TPO PP 2-3). "
698,10," The term ""rescue"" is apparently a term of art in antiabortion circles with a meaning that is not apparent from the word itself. 
Defendant Terry has defined the term ""rescue"" or ""rescue missions"" as ""heroic attempts by God-fearing people to save babies 
and mothers from abortion on a particular day by peacefully, but physically blockading abortion mills with their bodies to 
intervene between abortionists and the innocent victims."" (Pls. TPO Ex. 46 at 2 (emphasis in original)). In this memorandum 
opinion, the term ""rescue"" connotes a variety of antiabortion protest activities including both legal and illegal tactics aimed at 
preventing women from exercising their right to have an abortion and preventing abortion providers from providing such services 
to women. See Leslie Gielow Jacobs, Nonviolent Abortion Clinic Protests: Reevaluating Some Current Assumptions about the 
Proper Scope of Government Regulations, 70 Tul. L. Rev. 1359, 1366-67 (1996) (footnotes omitted) (""'Rescues' involve a host of 
. . . activities, ranging from picketing, distribution of literature, chanting, and attempts at sidewalk persuasion-also called 
'counseling' to trespasses on clinic property to blockade it, name-calling, destruction of clinic property, threats of violence, and 
actual violence directed at clinic patients and personnel.""); Regina R. Campbell, ""FACE""ing the Facts: Does the Freedom of 
Access to Clinic Entrances Act Violate Freedom of Speech?, 64 U. Cin. L. Rev. 947, 953-54 (1996) (footnotes omitted) 
(""'Rescue' demonstrations consist of two types of clinic blockades. The first is an actual physical blockade of the entrances to an 
abortion clinic to prevent anyone from entering the clinic. The second type of blockade involves constructively blockading the 
clinic by demonstrating in a loud and disruptive manner and harassing patients and personnel entering the clinic in an attempt to 
drive women seeking abortions away from the clinic.""). "
699,11," For example, specific evidence of PLAN's adoption of this strategy is the rash of clinic shutdowns in Wichita, Kansas during 
the ""Summer of Mercy"" campaign sponsored by PLAN in 1991. (See 12(N) Pls. TPO P 31; Pls. TPO Ex. 85 at 3-5; Pls. TPO Ex.

700,14," For the remainder of this memorandum opinion, the court intends the term ""defendants"" to include defendants Terry, 
Operation Rescue, Project Life, and Migliorino unless otherwise stated. It should be further noted that defendants TPO raise 
certain arguments that defendant Migliorino does not, however, this fact is inconsequential to the court's analysis. For example, in her motion for summary judgment, defendant Migliorino does not contest whether PLAN constitutes an 
enterprise within the meaning of RICO. (See Motion for Summary Judgment by Defendant Monica Migliorino (Miller)). However, 
since plaintiffs must demonstrate that PLAN is an enterprise in order to implicate any defendant under RICO, including 
defendant Migliorino, her omission of this argument is of no effect. "
702,15," Plaintiffs allege that defendants committed the following predicate acts: extortion, murder, kidnaping, arson, taking possession 
of interstate shipments of fetal remains, obstruction of interstate commerce, and travel and use of facilities in interstate 
commerce with intent to commit violent crimes. These alleged acts are separate a apart from PLAN's existence as an 
antiabortion coalition engaged in lawful protest and planning. "
703,16," The Court ultimately concluded that the defendant's incorrect valuation of a farm cooperative's assets could not give rise to 
RICO liability because the defendant had not ""conducted, or participated, directly or indirectly, in the conduct"" or direction of the 
affairs of the farm cooperative--the alleged RICO enterprise. Reves, at    ,    , 113 S. Ct. at 1170, 1172, 1173-74."
703,17," The Court expressly rejected the argument that HN10[
] the term ""participate"" encompassed the broad term ""aid and abet."" Reves, 507 U.S. at 178, 113 S. Ct. at 1170. Not only did the Court hold that these terms were not synonymous, but it found that 
the former had a narrower meaning in light of Congress's distinction between the act of conducting an enterprises's affairs and 
participating in the conduct of an enterprise's affairs.  Id. at 178-79, 113 S. Ct. at 1170. Justice Souter, in dissent, described the 
majority's finding of ""a clear congressional mandate to limit RICO liability . . . to participants in the 'operation or management' of 
a RICO enterprise."" Id. at    $, 113 S. Ct. at 1174."
703,18," The First, Second, and Eleventh Circuits have also developed a concept of ""outside"" versus ""inside"" participation in an 
enterprise which allows RICO liability to be imposed on lower-rung employees. See United States v. Starrett, 55 F.3d 1525, 
1548 (11th Cir. 1995) (""We agree with the First Circuit that one may be liable under the operation or management test 'by 
knowingly implementing decisions, as well as by making them.'""); United States v. Wong, 40 F.3d 1347, 1373 (2d Cir. 1994) 
(relying on Reves to support rule that a defendant acting under the direction if superiors in a RICO enterprise may be subject to 
liability by virtue if their ""participation""); United States v. Oreto, 37 F.3d 739, 750 (1st Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1177, 115 
S. Ct. 1161, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1116 (1995) (extending RICO liability to those ""inside employees"" who ""knowingly implement[]. . . , as 
well as"" make decisions of an enterprise). "
704,19," While the evidence supports a finding that Terry was elected to the Leadership Council in 1987, there is no evidence that 
Terry maintained a position in the operation or management of PLAN since then. On the other hand, absent any evidence of 
resignation by Terry from the PLAN Leadership Council, a reasonable factfinder may infer continued direction of PLAN's affairs 
by Terry via the Leadership Council at least through 1988. These facts, if proved, show that Terry occupied a significant role in 
PLAN's operation and management. Thus, as to defendant Terry, the court finds that a genuine issue exists as to whether he 
conducted PLAN (or participated in the conduct of PLAN) in violation of RICO. "
706,20," ""Lock and block"" refers to tactics used to prevent ingress to abortion facilities whereby protestors lock or chain themselves to 
the edifice or another object and block the entryway to the facility. "
707,21, See supra at 9.
707,22," HN12[
] Section 1961(5) defines a ""pattern of racketeering activity"" as requiring ""at least two acts of racketeering activity"" within a ten-year period. Id. In their motion for summary judgment, defendants do not challenge plaintiffs ability to prove at trial 
the alleged predicate acts occurred within a ten-year period. Indeed, the allegations, if proved, will demonstrate that numerous 
predicate acts were committed by defendants over a ten-year period. For these reasons, the court will not address the ""pattern"" 
element in this motion. "
708,," Plaintiffs further claim that defendants are barred from challenging plaintiffs Travel Act and state law extortion allegations since 
they were not challenged in the summary judgment motions. Accordingly, the court will address defendants' motion as to the 
following predicate acts only: (1) Hobbs Act violations, (2) murder, (3) kidnap, (4) arson, and (5) theft of interstate property. See, 
e.g., Washington Nat. Ins. Co. v. Hendricks, 855 F. Supp. 1542, 1556-57 (W.D. Wis. 1994) (holding that plaintiff waived claim by 
failing to raise it in any of its briefs on summary judgment). "
710,23," It is not clear whether these women were ""turned away"" as a result of defendants clearly protected activity of sidewalk 
counseling or as a result of the blockade. (See Pls. Ex. 44). This is a material factual dispute that cannot be determined on 
summary judgment."
710,24," Plaintiffs also cite evidence that defendant Terry's initial ideas for protest activity involved the destruction of property, throwing 
furniture out of clinic windows, barricading pro-life demonstrators inside of clinics. (See 12(N) Pls. TPO P 7). However, there is 
no proof that these ideas were ever brought to fruition. "
711,25," The evidence shows that Burnett later signed a petition in support of the ""justifiable homicide"" defense with respect to the 
criminal prosecution of Paul Hill. (Pls. TPO Ex. 91). This petition does not contain the signatures of any other alleged leaders of 
PLAN or named defendants. (See id.). "

713,29," Both parties cite only federal law in argument regarding the claim for intentional interference with a prospective business 
relationship (or prospective economic advantage) and neither party addresses the choice-of-law issue with respect this count.

provisions. See International Adm'rs, Inc. v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., 753 F.2d 1373, 1376 n. 4 (7th Cir. 1985). For tort claims, 
where the laws of two states are essentially the same, courts apply the law of the forum state. See Railway Express Agency, Inc. 
v. Super Scale Models, Ltd., 934 F.2d 135, 139 (7th Cir. 1991) (applying Wisconsin choice of law rules for tortious interference 
claim because Wisconsin and New York law recognized essentially the same elements for the claim). ""Conflicts rules are 
appealed to only when a difference in law will make a difference to the outcome,"" International Adm'rs, 753 F.2d at 1376 n. 4, 
and this court has discerned no material difference between Wisconsin and Illinois law regarding the tort of intentional 
interference with prospective economic advantage. Thus, it is appropriate for this court to apply Illinois law to Count III. See 
International Adm'rs, 753 F.2d at 1378 n. 5. "

that Vital-Med performed certain services, i.e. the processing of fetal remains, for plaintiffs in the context of a business 
relationship. Plaintiffs may have therefore incorrectly brought this claim where a contractual relationship already exists between 
the plaintiff laboratories and Vital-Med."
715,32," As stated earlier, HN26[

choice of law provisions. See International Adm'rs, Inc. v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., 753 F.2d 1373, 1376 n. 4 (7th Cir. 1985). 
Illinois employs the ""most significant relationship"" test as set out in the Restatement 2d of Conflicts.  Id. at 1376-77 n. 4. Under 
that test, the court must weigh various contacts to determine which state has the most significant relationship to the transaction 
at issue. Id. Here, defendant Migliorino assumes the applicability of the laws of Wisconsin. All of the factors relevant to the specific conduct 
at issue--the letter writing campaign and Migliorino's visit with Lee--point toward Wisconsin. Accordingly, Wisconsin law governs. 
See, e.g., Firkin v. U.S. Polychemical Corp., 835 F. Supp. 1048, 1050 (N.D. Ill. 1993) (applying Illinois choice of law rules, when 
injury occurred in Illinois and plaintiff was domiciled in Illinois, defendant's incorporation in New York did not overcome the 
presumption that the law of the place of injury applies); Rosett v. Schatzman, 157 Ill. App. 3d 939, 943, 510 N.E.2d 968, 971, 
109 Ill. Dec. 900 (1987) (fact that plaintiff and defendant both resided in Illinois did not justify application of Illinois law where 
defendant's conduct and plaintiff's injury both occurred in Florida). "
716,33," It should be noted, however, that this dispute stems from Migliorino's testimony that she was ""informed"" that a binding 
agreement did not exist, not from her subjective interpretation of the circumstances. Indeed, the court may not rely Migliorino's 
subjective appreciation of the facts. See, e.g.  Boll v. Hyatt Corp., 243 Ill. App. 3d 1005, 1009, 614 N.E.2d 71, 74, 184 Ill. Dec.

Of course if you lease the building there will be no rest from us . . . ."" ""Clean up your act and tell Summit that you won't let them murder babies in your building or my friends and I will make

substantive claim sufficient to survive summary disposition.' "" Too much should not be made of this statement, however, for at 
the same time, the opinion acknowledged that the plaintiff there had standing, and it granted summary judgment on the merits. 
More importantly, Walker II was clarified in Bell, supra, which avoided an antitrust injury inquiry by resorting to the easy 
conclusion that the plaintiff's damage claim was too speculative.  Bell, 847 F.2d at 1183 (citing Associated Gen. Contractors v.

731,10," As an initial matter, DHJ argues that since only the standing issues were addressed by the district court Order granting 
motions for partial summary judgment and Order denying motion for reconsideration, only these orders were certified as final 
pursuant to Rule 54(b), and because these are the only two orders referenced in its Notice of Appeal, this court lacks jurisdiction 
to consider any of the alternative grounds for affirmance raised by appellees. DHJ relies on United Industries v. Eimco Process 
Equip. Co., 61 F.3d 445, 448 (5th Cir.1995), which held that in an interlocutory appeal certified under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), the 
court lacked jurisdiction to consider district court orders outside the scope of certification. DHJ's reliance on Eimco is misplaced. This is not an appeal of an interlocutory order certified under section 1292(b), but a 
partial summary judgment certified as final under Rule 54(b) and over which jurisdiction exists under section 1291. As such, 
a notice of appeal identifying the district court's order dismissing DHJ's antitrust claims properly confers jurisdiction on this 
court over all interlocutory orders on the way to that partial final judgment. "

732,12," In its memorandum opinion, the district court rejected DHJ's claim of per se liability, and DHJ does not here contend that this 
part of the decision was incorrect. We agree with the district court that this is not a case appropriate for per se treatment. See 
Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 50 n. 16, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 2557 n. 16, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977); see also

dominance is illegal. See Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, 342 U.S. 143, 72 S. Ct. 181, 96 L. Ed. 162 (1951). This argument 
relates to a claim of monopolization or attempted monopolization and is addressed below with DHJ's Section 2 claims."
732,14," Inconsistently, DHJ considers the members of SMA competitors in this context, but only lists East Jefferson and one other 
SMA member, Lakeside Hospital, among those hospitals competing in what it defines as the relevant market. "

West publications addressing this topic ""almost always come to the same conclusion: the staffing decision of a single hospital 
was not a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act"")."
734,17," The parties vehemently dispute whether East Jefferson actually negotiated higher prices with SMA. Although East Jefferson's 
contract with SMA clearly calls for higher rates for a number of procedures, determining which hospital charged SMA more for 
actual patient visits is a complicated inquiry. The provider contracts contain provisions capping the maximum discount for billed 
services, giving different discounts for different procedures, and otherwise confusing the inquiry into the price charged on PPO 
business. Dr. Zaretsky's report concluded that DHJ's charges were cheaper in practice, while East Jefferson produced a Deloitte 
& Touche report concluding that East Jefferson's charges were cheaper in practice. For purposes of this appeal, we assume that 
East Jefferson was able to negotiate a contract with SMA that paid it a higher price for its services than DHJ's contract. "

735,19," Surely DHJ does not wish to suggest that its replacing East Jefferson in the Healthcare Advantage PPO is a potential antitrust 
violation because Healthcare Advantage subscribers' choices have been interfered with. "
736,20," To the extent that DHJ relies on proof of the tendency of the defendants' actions to have anticompetitive effects, as opposed to 
actual anticompetitive effects, DHJ must also establish market power in the relevant market in order to recover under Section 1.

into exclusive arrangements with other specialists (Albert Dep at 35), it had never done so with Medicor. Other cardiologist have 
provided services at Hamot (Sharma Aff. P 7; Feraro Aff. P 4; Zone Aff. P 8; Furr Aff. P 5; Furr Dep. 25-26) and Medicor

Burdette Tomlin Memorial Hospital, 857 F.2d 96, 119 (3d Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1078, 103 L. Ed. 2d 834, 109 S. Ct. 
1528 (1989); and (2) it is immune from damages under the HCQIA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 11101 et seq. In ruling on Hamot's motion to 
dismiss, this Court has already rejected these arguments because Plaintiffs have disclaimed any challenge to professional peer 
review actions. "
772,16," As a competitor, the Clinic's motive is apparent on its face. However, the nature of Plaintiffs' section 1 claims are such that, if 
Medicor and Hamot become entitled to summary judgment, so does the Clinic. Without the participation of Medicor and Hamot, 
the Clinic could have no control over referrals and could not destroy Plaintiffs' practice."
772,17," A believable theory of predatory pricing, therefore, must take into account how the conspirators, if successful, expect to 
recover more long term monopoly profits than they will sustain short term losses.  Id. at 589. "
773,18," Dr. Kish testified that the desire to have exclusive status was a ""common theme"" at the Clinic and that, although he could not 
recall any specific incidents, Dr. D'Angelo had ""probably"" expressed that sentiment to someone outside the Clinic. (Kish Dep. at 
54.)"
773,19," The record indicates Dr. D'Angelo threatened to move patients to a different hospital over quality of care issues, but that these 
threats were not taken seriously. (Kish Dep. 32; DiLuzio Dep. 89; Diluzio Aff. 1.)"
773,20, (Pls.' Ex. 9.) 
774,21," At oral argument, Plaintiffs speculated that this anomaly could be viewed as an attempt by Hamot to cover its tracks to avoid 
an antitrust suit. (Tr. at 99-100.) There is no evidence suggesting such a tactic was ever considered. "
776,22," Plaintiffs' attempt to defeat this fact consists of speculation about how the individual bonuses of the Medicor cardiologists 
""must be conditioned to some degree on their productivity."" (Pls.' Br. at 10 n.4.)"
776,23," Even if the statement were admissible, it would not be sufficient to create a material issue of fact so as to help defeat summary 
judgment. The statement is little more than a comment acknowledging that Medicor was referring exclusively to the Clinic - a fact 
that is not in dispute. The issue is not whether Medicor was referring exclusively to the Clinic, but rather why it was doing so. "
778,24," In this respect, the record reflects that a trend to refer to the Clinic in lieu of Dr. Hanson's group was already developing prior 
to the December 1989 staffing meeting which Plaintiffs claim marked the first overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy to deny 
them referrals. "
779,25, Dr. Hanson never asked any of the other Clinic Defendants to assist him. (Id. at 487.)
779,26," Dr. Hanson stated Dr. Furr told him the criteria was ""designed to get Sherafat."" (Hanson Dep. 158.) This statement does not 
show that Dr. D'Angelo was involved in the implementation of the rule or that it was designed to ""get"" surgeons who competed 
with the Clinic. "
780,27," Plaintiffs suggest that Hamot's concern for its inability to measure their quality of care should be viewed as pretext because 
Hamot could have obtained a statistically significant sample of their surgeries by counting surgeries from past years. As already 
discussed, contemporary studies had linked maintaining surgical volume to quality of care. Thus, Hamot was perfectly justified in 
requiring a minimum level of proficiency. Second, Hamot had a legitimate interest in measuring quality of care based on recent 
surgeries rather than those occurring several years prior. "
781,28," We do not read Plaintiffs' complaint to allege that such a policy would constitute an illegal combination or conspiracy among 
the individual Clinic Defendants under Section 1 of the Sherman Act."
781,29," Under the ""intent"" test, ""a business is free not to deal with whomever it pleases so long it has no 'purpose to create or maintain 
a monopoly.'"" Byars v. Bluff City News Co., Inc., 609 F.2d 843, 855 (6th Cir. 1980) (citing Colgate, 250 U.S. at 307)."
781,30," The ""essential facilities"" doctrine applies when a plaintiff can show ""(1) control of the essential facility by a monopolist; (2) the 
competitor's inability practically or reasonably to duplicate the essential facility; (3) denial of the use of the facility to a competitor; 
and (4) the feasibility of providing the facility."" Ideal Dairy Farms, Inc. v. John Labatt, Ltd., 90 F.3d 737, 748 (3d Cir. 1996) 
(citations omitted). "
789,1," In his original complaint filed on May 18, 1995, Sokol asserted state claims for Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Intentional Infliction of 
Emotional Distress, Denial of Due Process of Law, and Breach of the Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing. Sokol omitted each 
of these claims from his second amended complaint. "
790,2," Defendants Daniel P. Guyton, M.D., Michael A. Oddi, M.D., and Cardio-Thoracic and Vascular Surgeons, Inc. have not filed 
motions for summary judgment. "
793,3," For immunity to attach to a professional review action, the results of the action must be reported to the State Board of Medical 
Examiners in compliance with 42 U.S.C. § 11133. Mathews v. Lancaster General Hosp., 87 F.3d 624, 632 (3rd Cir. 1996). 
Because Akron General did not demonstrate compliance with this requirement, the court assumes that it was not satisfied. 
Nevertheless the court will analyze the immunity issue in full. "
796,4," Numerous courts have concluded that ""the loss of a physician's staff privileges, without more, is not an antitrust injury because 
the loss does not harm the consumer of medical services, but simply constitutes a personal harm to the individual physician."" 
Baglio v. Baska, 940 F. Supp. 819, 828 (W.D. Pa. 1996). See also BCB Anesthesia Care, Ltd. v. Passavant Mem. Area Hosp. 
Ass'n, 36 F.3d 664, 667-68 (7th Cir. 1994) (listing numerous cases where courts found that the staffing decision of a single 
hospital was not a violation of the Sherman Act). "
798,5," In arguing an unreasonable restraint of trade, Sokol again submits Eisenstadt Affidavit PP 47-48 as evidence of anticompetitive 
effects. Opposition Brief on Antitrust Issues p. 27. "
799,6," Sokol also failed to produce sufficient evidence that Oddi or CTVS has a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power to 
defeat a motion for summary judgment. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the relevant market is the 
market for adult cardiac surgery in Akron, Ohio. A defendant has monopoly power in the relevant market if it has the ability to 
control prices or exclude competition.  United States v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 391, 100 L. Ed. 1264, 76 
S. Ct. 994 (1956). Although plaintiff's expert predicts that there is a ""risk of a price increase"" if Sokol is eliminated as a cardiac 
surgeon in the Akron market, plaintiff does not produce evidence of price increases since June 1994 when Sokol was 
substantially eliminated from the market. Further, there is no evidence that Odd or CTVS can exclude competitors (other cardiac 
surgeons) from entering the market, or that there are significant barriers to entry. Therefore, Sokol has not produced evidence 
that Oddi or CTVS has a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power. Even though conspiracy to monopolize does not 
require a plaintiff to demonstrate a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power, where the alleged conspiracy, if 
successful, would not result in illegal monopolization, there may be no liability for conspiracy to monopolize. 1 ABA Antitrust 
Law Developments (Fourth) p. 305 (1997). "
800,7," Sokol's federal and state claims against Guyton, Oddi and CTVS remain because those parties have not filed motions for 
summary judgment. Further, the magistrate judge retains consent jurisdiction over Sokol's supplemental claim for wrongful 
termination of privileges. "

830,11," In its motion for partial summary judgment on Ford's Robinson-Patman Act defenses, Metro fails to account for the fact that 
the CPA program is functionally available to all dealers and thus engages in a discussion regarding the ""meeting competition"" 
defense that is irrelevant to the resolution of Metro's Robinson-Patman Act claim. Consequently, Metro's motion for partial 
summary judgment on Ford's Robinson-Patman Act defenses is denied."

vehicles."" Metro's Response to Ford's Motion for Summary Judgment - Metro's Antitrust Claims at 19. However, this admission 
does not prove that Ford discriminated in price among dealers. It only highlights the fact that the amount of CPA varied with the 
competitive situation. Two identical trucks could receive various levels of CPA, depending on whether the sale qualified for sales 
advantage, appeal level, or leasing schedule CPA. The important fact is that no matter what level of CPA applied, that level was 
available to all dealers."

831,15," Ford seeks only partial summary judgment against Foley on its claim under the RICO Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq., since it 
concedes that the amount of damages must be established at trial. Foley, in opposing the motion, does not brief the elements of 
liability under the statute but is content to argue that Ford cannot establish any damage from RICO violations."

The board shall set a hearing date as soon as practicable and shall rule on whether the manufacturer, importing distributor

which he possesses distribution rights for that product, the importing distributor or distributor shall lower the wholesale price

to whether the HFS franchise package constitutes a product that is separate and distinct from the logoed amenities, and would 
thus be capable of serving as a ""tying product"" for such amenities; whether a 12 percent share of the national hotel market or a 
25 percent share of the franchised hotel market could give HFS ""market power,"" the courts having repeatedly held that a 30 
percent market share is insufficient to confer the market power without which a tie cannot be illegal per se; and whether a tying

thereby adding SciMed as a party. BSC and SciMed signed a merger agreement on November 8, 1994, and as a result SciMed 
is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of BSC. While this counterclaim similarly seeks to enjoin SciMed from further alleged 
infringement of the '129 patent, Magistrate Judge Alexander cautioned that the addition of SciMed as a party would be limited to 
SYNERGY catheters. Magistrate Judge Alexander explained: "
890,," The 'SYNERGY Catheters already at issue' refer to any catheters previously deemed within the SYNERGY catheter 
product line due to their injection into this claim regardless of their actual, specific names. Defendant's motion refers to the 
SYNERGY catheter as the SYNERGY, SYNERGY II, SYNERGY III, OUTSIDER, ENERGY and HIGH ENERGY. The Court 
notes that if the OUTSIDER, ENERGY, or HIGH ENERGY catheters mentioned in defendant's renewed motion do not fall 
within the realm of the 'SYNERGY catheter already at issue' because they were not previously considered part of this 
dispute, then addition of SciMed as to those catheters is not allowed. Boston Scientific Corp. v. Schneider (Europe) AG, 983 F. Supp. 245, 249 n.5 (D. Mass. 1996) (order on various discovery 
motions and motions to amend). SciMed asserts as an affirmative defense to the counterclaim that the Bonzel patent ""is unenforceable . . . for misuse of the 
patent in its enforcement and in violation of the patent and antitrust laws."" This affirmative defense was interposed the same day 
that BSC and SciMed served their oppositions to the motions to dismiss in the second action before me, Boston Scientific Corp. 
v. Advanced Cardiovascular Sys., Inc., 983 F. Supp. 245. Plaintiff and defendant-in-counterclaim SciMed is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Minnesota, having an 
office and principal place of business in Maple Grove, Minnesota."
890,5," Defendant ACS is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of California, having an office and principal place of 
business in Santa Clara, California."
890,6," For convenience, I will refer to the '129 patent and the '129 reexamination certificate collectively as the ""Bonzel patent."" "
891,7," For an extended discussion on the history of PTCA, see SciMed, 852 F. Supp. at 824-26."
891,8," In some designs the two tubes are joined, side-by-side. In other designs, the guide wire tube is inside the inflation tube. Thus, 
to the naked eye, a balloon dilatation catheter can appear as one very small tube, when in reality it is composed of two barely 
visible tunnels."
891,9," If a physician is not able to hold onto the end of the bare wire--while at the same time sliding the balloon catheter off the wire--
the wire would be pulled out of the patient's body simultaneously. "
894,10," In determining the motion to dismiss, I may take judicial notice of other related cases, as well as consider the Schneider and 
ACS Settlement Agreement, which was adequately referenced in the Complaint. See Watterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 3-4 (1st 
Cir. 1993). "
895,11," Judge Alsop found that the injunction did not apply to the SYNERGY catheter. Thus, he did not reach the issue of whether the 
relationship between the two companies was a basis for binding BSC. "
896,12," While the term ""res judicata"" is now often used to denote claim preclusion, and the term ""collateral estoppel"" to denote issue 
preclusion, the First Circuit follows the traditional view that res judicata is a broad concept that includes both claim and issue 
preclusion. See Grella v. Salem Five Cent Savs. Bank, 42 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir. 1994)."
896,13," HN8[
] Under claim preclusion, ""a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from 
relitigating the claims that were raised or could have been raised in that action."" Apparel Art Int'l, Inc. v. Amertex Enters. Ltd., 48 
F.3d 576, 583 (1st Cir. 1995) (citing Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 94, 66 L. Ed. 2d 308, 101 S. Ct. 411 (1980)). ""The focal 
inquiry in assessing the applicability of [claim preclusion] is whether the causes of action raised in the separate lawsuits are the 
same."" Id. Claim preclusion does not apply here because, while many of the issues are the same as in SciMed, the causes of 
action in the two cases (i.e., infringement based on sales of SYNERGY catheters and infringement based on sales of RALLY 
and EXPRESS catheters) do not share a common nucleus of operative facts. "
897,14," SciMed asserts that Schneider's actions ""have great resonance also in the related area of relieving a litigant from a prior 
judgment obtained against it by fraud."" (SciMed Opp. Partial Summ. J. Unenforceability at 11.) I need not decide whether ""fraud 
on the court,"" a ground for relief from judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b), is also a separate defense to the application of 
collateral estoppel, because I find that Schneider did not carry out an ""unconscionable scheme calculated to interfere with the 
judicial system's ability impartially to adjudicate a matter."" George P. Reintjes Co. v. Riley Stoker Corp., 71 F.3d 44, 48 n.5 (lst 
Cir. 1995) (quoting Aoude v. Mobil Oil Corp., 892 F.2d 1115, 1118 (1st Cir. 1989)). However, I decide only that SciMed has failed here to show facts sufficient for me to set aside the preclusive effect of the 
SciMed decision. I express no opinion as to whether SciMed is entitled to Rule 60(b) relief from Judge Alsop himself."
897,15," Although Schneider's motion with respect to SciMed concerns ""unenforceability,"" and its motions with respect to BSC concern 
""validity"" and ""inequitable conduct,"" I note again that these issues all involve the same underlying conduct. "
898,16," Schneider also urges application of HN12[
] an ""alter ego"" theory, which allows a court to ""pierce the corporate veil""--and 
hold a parent corporation accountable for the liabilities of its subsidiary--after considering such factors as lack of independence 
between parent and subsidiary, fraudulent intent, and manifest injustice. See, e.g., United Elec. Workers of Am. v. 163 Pleasant 
Street Corp., 960 F.2d 1080, 1093 (1st Cir. 1992). Although this theory itself is not directly applicable to the issue of collateral 
estoppel (in contrast to issues such as financial liability and personal jurisdiction), see Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 
59(5), the underlying principles are relevant to virtual representation and will be treated below."
898,17," Schneider makes much of the fact that BSC did not assert inequitable conduct until after the merger, and ESC responds that it 
had long contemplated doing so but had waited until it was satisfied that a sufficient basis existed. Because I find below that 
BSC is bound on both issues, this dispute is irrelevant to my decision. "
900,18," BSC stresses that it brought this litigation prior to the merger, and that it is still exposed to significant potential liability for its 
pre-merger sales and continuing manufacture of the SYNERGY catheters. Thus, BSC appears to argue that SciMed's effective 
relitigation of the issues is merely an inevitable consequence of BSC's need to litigate the issues on its own behalf. To the 
contrary, I find that BSC is responsible for bringing about this state of affairs by voluntarily merging with and transferring 
SYNERGY sales to SciMed."
900,19," I acknowledge that HN15[
] ""when questions of validity and infringement are raised in the same proceeding, the trial court 
should decide both issues and enter a judgment on both."" Simmons Fastener Corp. v. Illinois Tool Works, Inc., 739 F.2d 1573, 
1576 (Fed. Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1065, 85 L. Ed. 2d 496, 105 S. Ct. 2138 (1985); accord In re Lockwood, 50 F.3d 
966, 968 n.2 (Fed. Cir.), vacated on other grounds, 515 U.S. 1182, 132 L. Ed. 2d 911, 116 S. Ct. 29 (1995); Lindemann 
Maschinenfabrik Gmbh v. American Hoist & Derrick Co., 730 F.2d 1452, 1463 (Fed. Cir. 1984). As a result, I emphasize that my 
refusal to reach the validity issue is based not upon my holding on the infringement issue, but rather upon my holding that the 
validity issue may not be raised. "
901,20," HN18[
] ""Claims"" are numbered paragraphs that provide the concise formal definition of the invention. The ""specification"" 
contains a written description of the invention that must enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention. 
However, only the claims govern in setting limitations. See Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 980 (Fed. Cir. 
1995), aff'd, 517 U.S. 370, 134 L. Ed. 2d 577, 116 S. Ct. 1384 (1996). "
903,21," In addition, BSC argues that its ENERGY and HIGH ENERGY catheters are not subject to United States patent laws because 
they are all manufactured and sold exclusively outside the United States."
903,22," The description of the invention and the drawings required by 35 U.S.C. §§ 112 and 113 are set forth in the original Bonzel 
patent. (BSC Mot. Summ. J. Non-Infringement, Ex. 1.) However, the claims of Bonzel's original patent have been superseded 
and replaced by a Reexamination Certificate. (BSC Mot. Summ. J. Non-Infringement, Ex. 2.) The claims contained in the latter 
document are legally operative here for purposes of infringement analysis. See 35 U.S.C. § 307; SciMed, 852 F. Supp. at 827-
28. "
904,23," While the second tube of the SYNERGY catheter, with or without stylet, clearly provides additional stiffness, there is a genuine 
issue as to whether the first tube nevertheless has sufficient stiffness on its own. In arguing that Schneider should not be granted 
summary judgment of infringement, BSC itself asserts that this is ""a plainly contested issue of fact."" (BSC Reply Summ. J. Non-
Infringement at 20.) I note that Schneider's position--i.e., that the SYNERGY first tube does have sufficient stiffness--is based 
upon its erroneous view that the majority of the SYNERGY second tube is actually part of the first tube. As a result, Schneider 
will be hard-pressed to deny that the properly construed SYNERGY first tube has sufficient stiffness on its own. Nevertheless, on 
the evidence before me I cannot say that there is no genuine issue. "
905,24," In declining to find substantial equivalence under the function-way-result test, I reject--for the second time-- Schneider's efforts 
to broaden the scope of its claim. Schneider's characterization of the ""way"" in which the Bonzel tube achieves rapid exchange 
capability effectively changes the inquiry to whether the accused device is one ""having the guide wire inside the catheter body 
for a relatively short distance."" However, Schneider cannot avoid the fact that the claims themselves describe the way in which 
that result is achieved-- i.e., through ""termination"" of the second tube. See Dolly, Inc. v. Spalding & Evenflo Cos., 16 F.3d 394, 
398 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (""The doctrine of equivalents is not a license to ignore claim limitations."")."
905,25," At the hearing on this motion, Schneider's counsel argued that the proximal portion of the SYNERGY second tube is the 
equivalent of additional structure contemplated in the Bonzel claim prosecution. Specifically, counsel pointed to Bonzel's 
suggestion that some of the advantages of the full-length second tube--namely, the ability to take distal pressure measurements 
and to inject visualization dye--could be recovered in his device through the addition of yet a third lumen. This argument might 
have been persuasive if the proximal portion of the SYNERGY second tube served the same purposes as such a third lumen 
and had been located in conjunction with the guide wire tube simply in order to circumvent the claim language. However, the primary purpose of SYNERGY's full-length second tube is not to provide pressure and dye capability, but rather to 
facilitate guide wire exchange. This feature apparently was not contemplated by Bonzel, and it makes the full-length second tube 
a necessary part of the catheter, rather than a structure strategically placed to avoid infringement. "
906,26," I note that the interchangeability analysis likely is more directly applicable to such situations as where an accused device 
substitutes a slightly different chemical or other basic physical ingredient for a claimed ingredient of the patented device. This is 
because the knowledge of interchangeability can arise from the use of such ingredients in other settings."
906,27," Similarly, as noted above, the full-length second tube in the SYNERGY catheter does not serve a purpose which could just as 
easily be served by the addition of a separate structure unrelated to the claims. "
909,28," In addition, a substantial portion of the complaint is devoted to a recitation of Schneider's alleged misconduct before the PTO 
and the Minnesota court. (First Am. Compl. at 19-26.) As I held above, however, both SciMed and BSC are precluded from 
litigating those issues here. See supra part V. "
910,29," As I explain below, the allegations of sham litigation and refusal to deal fail to stand apart from the claim that the settlement 
and cross-licensing agreement are themselves illegal. "
911,30," Of course, the complaint states that the alleged overlapping nature of the Bonzel and Yock patents is a direct result of the 
settlement between Schneider and ACS. (First Am. Compl. P 42B.) This merely repeats the complaint's central allegation--i.e., 
that it was illegal for the parties to withdraw their opposition to the respective patents. I address that issue in subsection 
VIII.A.2.a., supra. "
912,31," I note that SciMed's second affirmative defense in the California litigation has been dismissed with prejudice for failure to state 
a cognizable claim of patent misuse.  Advanced Cardiovascular Sys., Inc. v. SciMed Sys., Inc., 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11702, 
No. C-96-0950 DLJ, 1996 WL 467293, at *3-5 (N.D. Cal. July 24, 1996). The court stated that ""the crux of this defense is that 
ACS knew the patent was invalid or unenforceable at the time it filed this action."" Id. at 7. In the very litigation claimed to be a 
sham, therefore, the judge has dismissed a defense which requires proof of the same facts now asserted as the basis for the 
allegation of sham."
912,32," I note that I already have granted BSC and SciMed one opportunity to amend their complaint in order to survive the motion to 
dismiss. The First Amended Complaint, while stating facts with greater particularity than the original complaint, fails to state a 
claim on which relief can be granted. The problem for BSC and SciMed is that their version of events, even if true, does not 
amount to a violation of the antitrust laws. "
919,1," The original complaint in this matter was filed by plaintiff Dee-K on April 17, 1997. By Order dated July 15, 1997, the complaint 
was dismissed without prejudice for failure to state a claim with the specificity and factual support required by Estate 
Construction Co. v. Miller & Smith, 14 F.3d 213, 220-21 (4th Cir. 1994). In the circumstances, Dee-K was given leave to amend 
the complaint. Thereafter, on July 25, 1997, Dee-K and a new plaintiff, Asheboro, filed an amended complaint. Defendants responded by filing 
the various motions to dismiss, pursuant to Rule 12, Fed. R. Civ. P., that are the subject of this opinion. After oral argument on 
those motions, plaintiffs filed a motion seeking leave to file a second amended complaint. That motion was granted, and thus the 
analysis of the instant motions to dismiss is based on the second amended complaint. In evaluating the several Rule 12(b) motions under consideration, the factual allegations in the second amended complaint are 
taken as true. See Martin Marietta Corp. v. International Telecom. Satellite Org., 991 F.2d 94, 97 (4th Cir. 1993) (citing Jenkins 
v. McKeithen, 395 U.S. 411, 421-22, 23 L. Ed. 2d 404, 89 S. Ct. 1843 (1969))."
919,2," Extruded rubber thread is vulcanized rubber thread made by forcing or drawing compounds of concentrated natural rubber 
latex through a die. "
920,3," Though it is not alleged in the complaint, the parties have indicated in oral argument that Globe, as a minority owner in Bakrie, 
has appointed two directors to Bakrie's board."
920,4," JPS was a named defendant in the original complaint and in the first amended complaint, but is omitted as a defendant in the 
second amended complaint. Whether that omission necessitates a dismissal of JPS with prejudice, pursuant to Rule 41, Fed. R. 
Civ. P., or the imposition of costs, pursuant to Rule 41, or sanctions, pursuant to Rule 11, Fed. R. Civ. P., will be the subject of a 
separate order."
920,5," Throughout this opinion these eight resellers -- one division of a producer, four subsidiaries, and three distributors -- are 
collectively referred to as ""distributors."""
920,6," It is worth noting at the outset that this case does not implicate Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 
81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984). There, the Supreme Court held that a parent corporation cannot legally conspire with 
its wholly owned subsidiary, as the two corporations are deemed a single enterprise. See id. at 777. In this case, although the 
wholly owned distributors cannot conspire with their parent-manufacturers, they can legally conspire with other manufacturers 
and distributors. In other words, while the parent and subsidiary are treated as one entity under Copperweld, that does not 
preclude each such entity from conspiring to fix prices with other, unrelated entities."
920,7," These include Rubber Thread Industries Sdn. Bhd. (""RTI"") and Worldflex Co., Ltd. (""Worldflex"")."
920,8," The minutes, attached to the amended complaint and incorporated by reference in the second amended complaint, state 
starkly that "
921,," ""the price of rubber thread should be set and determined by the manufacturers in total rather than let the market determine 
and set the price. [The Malaysian producers'] rationale is that this industry is still controlled by a limited number of existing 
players, and we should take full advantage of this fact."" Amended Complaint, Exh. B. "
922,9," Of course, § 12 provides only that service may be effected worldwide; it does not prescribe the proper means for accomplishing 
the service. In that regard, a plaintiff must comply with Rule 4, Fed. R. Civ. P."
922,10," Plaintiffs have included in the second amended complaint allegations regarding the contacts of certain defendants with the 
Commonwealth of Virginia. None of these allegations refers to Bakrie. Therefore, the analysis under Rule 4(k)(2) is appropriate. 
To the extent that those allegations turn out to be correct with respect to other defendants, they may provide an alternate basis 
on which to found jurisdiction, namely, under Virginia's long-arm statute."
922,11," The rule provides in full: HN3[
] If the exercise of jurisdiction is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States, serving a summons 
or filing a waiver of service is also effective, with respect to claims arising under federal law, to establish personal 
jurisdiction over the person of any defendant who is not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of general jurisdiction of any 
state. Rule 4(k)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P."
922,12," See Hogue v. Milodon Eng'g., Inc., 736 F.2d 989, 991 (4th Cir. 1984) (""Where Congress has authorized nationwide service of 
process, so long as the assertion of jurisdiction over the defendant is compatible with [Fifth Amendment] due process, the 
service of process is sufficient to establish jurisdiction of the federal court over the person of the defendant.""), quoted in 
Autoscribe Corp. v. Goldman & Steinberg, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 2848, 1995 WL 56662, at *3 (4th Cir. Feb. 3, 1995) 
(unpublished). Some courts have held that the venue provision of § 12 must be satisfied before worldwide service of process is authorized. 
See, e.g., Sea-Roy Corp. v. Parts R Parts, Inc., 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13565, 1996 WL 557857 (M.D.N.C. July 30, 1996). The 
Malaysian defendants argue that the Sea-Roy case is controlling, and thus that plaintiffs must prove that venue is proper in this 
district before there is proper jurisdiction over them. The Fourth Circuit has yet to address this question. The Ninth Circuit, 
however, appears to have expressed the better view on this matter. See Go-Video, Inc. v. Akai Elec. Co., 885 F.2d 1406, 1408 
(9th Cir. 1989) (holding that service may be effected under Clayton Act § 12 even when venue is established under 28 U.S.C. § 
1391(d)). Given that the issues of venue and jurisdiction present two distinct inquiries, it follows that resolution of each issue may 
be founded on separate, distinct bases. Thus, plaintiffs may avail themselves of § 12 for service purposes and § 1391(d) for 
venue purposes. Accordingly, this objection to jurisdiction must fail. "
923,13," There was no majority opinion in Asahi; thus, the validity of the stream-of-commerce theory remained debatable after that 
decision. In her plurality opinion, Justice O'Connor concluded that merely placing an object in the stream of commerce was 
insufficient to justify personal jurisdiction. Justice Brennan, in his concurrence, reasoned that when a party places a product in 
the stream of commerce and expects that it will be sold in the forum, ""the possibility of a lawsuit there cannot come as a 
surprise."" Asahi, 480 U.S. at 117 (Brennan, J., concurring in part)."
923,14," See also Federal Ins. Co. v. Lake Shore Inc., 886 F.2d 654, 659 (4th Cir. 1989) (holding that there can be no personal 
jurisdiction over a defendant that relinquishes control of its product to another because the ""'unilateral activity of another party or 
a third person' cannot satisfy the 'minimum contacts' requirement of due process"" (quoting Helicopteros Nacionales de 
Colombia, S.A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 417, 80 L. Ed. 2d 404, 104 S. Ct. 1868 (1983))). Some circuits other than the Fourth have followed Justice Brennan's view and concluded that placing products into the stream of 
commerce is sufficient to establish in personam jurisdiction. See, e.g., Dehmlow v. Austin Fireworks, 963 F.2d 941, 947 (7th Cir. 
1992); Irving v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 864 F.2d 383, 386 (5th Cir. 1989)."
923,15," The relevant forum in this case is the United States, not any particular state. That is so because, when Congress has provided 
for nationwide service of process, as in § 12 of the Clayton Act, the defendant need only have minimum contacts with the nation 
as a whole. See Go-Video, 885 F.2d at 1414 (using national contacts under § 12 of the Clayton Act); Fitzsimmons v. Barton, 589 
F.2d 330, 332-33 (7th Cir. 1979) (discussing nationwide service under § 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934); Board of 
Trustees, Sheet Metal Workers' Nat'l Pension Fund, 964 F. Supp. 1040, 1045 (E.D. Va. 1997) (holding that national-contacts 
theory applies under ERISA's nationwide-service provision). Moreover, defendants conceded at the July 15, 1997 hearing that 
the national-contacts approach was proper (Tr. at 23-24, 51, 60). Given this national-contacts approach, the only jurisdictional 
question remaining with respect to the Malaysian defendants, who also challenge the assertion of personal jurisdiction over 
them, is whether venue is proper in this district. That issue is taken up in Part III. The Supreme Court declined to rule on validity of the national-contacts approach in Asahi. See 480 U.S. at 113 n.*; see also 
Omni Capital Int'l v. Rudolf Wolff & Co., 484 U.S. 97, 102 n.5, 98 L. Ed. 2d 415, 108 S. Ct. 404 (1987) (again passing on the 
question). "
924,16," See also Sea-Roy, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13565, 1996 WL 557857. In Sea-Roy, one of the defendants was a German 
company that had no U.S. affiliates; had no officers, employees, or agents in the United States; sold its goods F.O.B. Germany; 
and maintained no control over the marketing activities of the distributor. On those facts, the district court refused to find that 
there was purposeful availment by the defendant."
924,17," In a letter to one of its customers, Globe states, ""We are not limited to the above inventory and will be happy to produce new 
Bakrie products . . . ."" The letter goes on to list several different gauges and colors in which the rubber thread is available. See 
Plaintiff's Reply to Renewed Motion to Dismiss of PT. Bakrie, Exh. A. Plaintiffs premise their argument not just on ""how special"" 
(e.g., the size and color differences) the goods are, but on the fact that Globe offers a custom-ordering system for Bakrie 
products. "
925,18," Bakrie's physical absence from the United States does not render it immune to the Court's powers. ""Although territorial 
presence frequently will enhance a potential defendant's affiliation with [the forum] . . . it is an inescapable fact of modern 
commercial life that a substantial amount of business is transacted solely by mail and wire communications across state lines . . 
. . So long as a commercial actor's efforts are purposefully directed toward residents of another [forum, the Supreme Court has] 
consistently rejected the notion that an absence of physical contacts can defeat personal jurisdiction there."" Burger King, 471 
U.S. at 476 (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added)."
925,19," The Fourth Circuit has alluded to this factor, but has never squarely faced it. See Lesnick, 35 F.3d at 947. In Lesnick, the 
plaintiff sued a Massachusetts manufacturer of cigarette filters. The filter manufacturer sent its filters to a cigarette manufacturer 
in Kentucky and New Jersey. The cigarettes were then sold in Maryland, where the alleged injury occurred. The court noted the 
importance of the purposeful-availment requirement and observed that a rule adopting the stream-of-commerce theory 'would 
subject defendants to judgment in locations based on the activity of third persons and not the deliberate conduct of the 
defendant, making it impossible for defendants to plan and structure their business contacts and risks."" 35 F.3d at 945. On the 
facts of that case, the Fourth Circuit refused to find that jurisdiction existed over the Massachusetts defendant. The panel went 
on to say, however, that its decision might have been different had the filter manufacturer directed its activity to a cigarette 
manufacturer in the forum. See 35 F.3d at 946-47. In the case at bar, of course, plaintiffs allege that Bakrie sold its product to 
Globe, whom it knew to be acting in the United States, the relevant forum here."
925,20," See Renner v. Lanard Toys Ltd., 33 F.3d 277, 282 (3rd Cir. 1994) (""Nothing in Justice O'Connor's plurality opinion suggests 
that the fact that a foreign manufacturer or seller rids itself of title by a sale F.O.B. a foreign port is enough to insulate that 
manufacturer or seller from jurisdiction if there is [a distributor who markets the product].""); Tobin v. Astra Pharmaceutical 
Products, Inc., 993 F.2d 528, 544 (6th Cir. 1993) (stating that a defendant ""cannot expect to rely solely on the use of an 
independent distributor to insulate it from suit""); Vermeulen v. Renault, U.S.A., Inc., 985 F.2d 1534, 1548 (11th Cir. 1993) (""The 
fact that title to the Renault vehicles passed to AMSC in France rather than in the United States in no way determines the 
degree of contacts between the United States and [the defendant].""); Benitez-Allende v. Alcan Aluminio do Brasil, S.A., 857 F.2d 
26, 30 (1st Cir. 1988) (Breyer, J.) (""The fact that title to the cookers passed in Brazil is beside the point, for if International Shoe 
stands for anything . . . it is that a truly interstate business may not shield itself from suit by a careful but formalistic structuring of 
its business dealings."" (internal quotation marks omitted)). "
926,21," The fifth Lesnick ""fair play"" factor has not been discussed. That factor, which considers furtherance of social policy, is, in this 
case, essentially a reiteration of the second, interest-of-the-forum factor, and thus need not be separately addressed."
926,22," Because jurisdiction exists over Bakrie, plaintiff's Motion for Jurisdictional Discovery must be denied as moot."
926,23," See Brunette Machine Works, Ltd. v. Kockum Industries, Inc., 406 U.S. 706, 714, 32 L. Ed. 2d 428, 92 S. Ct. 1936 (1972)

all the federal venue laws, general and special""); cf.  Go-Video, 885 F.2d at 1413 (holding that venue need not be established 
under the same statute that provides the basis for service of process). "
927,24," The fact that the foreign defendants can be sued in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(d) does not mean that they can 
also be found in this district, thereby creating a basis for proper venue as to the domestic defendants pursuant to § 1391(b)(3). 
Were this not so, in a case involving foreign and domestic defendants, § 1391(d) could be used as to the foreign defendants to 
circumvent the requirements of § 1391(b) as to the domestic defendants. Neither the statute as a whole, nor sensible policy, 
permits such a result. When, as here, there are both foreign and domestic defendants, § 1391(b) must be satisfied as to the 
domestic defendants."
927,25," While some may view Estate Construction as a retreat from notice pleading, its narrow and sharp focus is the proper role of 
discovery in an antitrust-conspiracy case. Federal discovery, which extends beyond the boundaries of the relevant to include 
that which might lead to the relevant, can often be extensive, expensive, and burdensome. Before this is inflicted on defendants, 
it is reasonable to insist that the claim asserted be based on more than a plaintiff's hope or suspicion. In other words, discovery 
is the cart, not the horse, and skeletal allegations of antitrust conspiracy based on no more than hope or suspicion wrongly put 
the cart before the horse. Estate Construction, with its requirement for specific allegations, ensures that this will not occur."
927,26," As noted above, the original complaint did not contain factual allegations sufficiently specific to survive Estate Construction. 
That complaint was dismissed without prejudice, and plaintiffs subsequently filed the amended complaint, and then the second "
928,," amended complaint. Defendants do not challenge that the second amended complaint states a claim with respect to the 
manufacturer-defendants. Paragraphs 29-33 provide specific factual allegations with respect to those parties."
928,27," Plaintiffs' suggestion that Estate Construction requires only that the conspiracy be pled with specificity, but that it does not 
require specific allegations with regard to each and every defendant, is without merit. Plaintiffs rely on a district court case in this 
circuit, In re Mid-Atlantic Toyota Antitrust Litigation, 525 F. Supp. 1265 (D. Md. 1981) (concluding that if a plaintiff has properly 
alleged an antitrust conspiracy, it need only plead enough facts regarding later co-conspirators to give those co-conspirator-
defendants notice of the charges against them). Plaintiffs' reliance is misplaced. The Fourth Circuit cited Mid-Atlantic in its Estate 
Construction opinion and noted that the plaintiff in that former case met the requirements for pleading an antitrust conspiracy 
only because he ""included the persons in attendance at the meetings, the topics discussed, and the impact these meetings had 
on the alleged conspiracy to restrain price competition."" Estate Construction, 14 F.3d at 222. Therefore, on its facts Mid-Atlantic 
is consistent with the requirements of Estate Construction, and to the extent Mid-Atlantic is construed as requiring less than 
Estate Construction, the former has been overruled by the latter."
928,28," The next sentence of the opinion reads, ""Nor does [the complaint] provide any details of the time, place and alleged effect of 
the conspiracy."" 14 F.3d at 221 (internal quotation marks omitted). Logically there would be no reason to include this second 
sentence if the elements of time, place, and effect did not constitute an additional, independent basis for alleging a conspiracy 
separate from the proof of ""communications, meetings, or other means"" that also carries the antitrust plaintiff over the Estate 
Construction hurdle."
928,29," See Plaintiffs' Reply to Renewed Motion to Dismiss of Malaysian Defendants, Exh. A."
928,30," The Malaysian defendants assert that this fax concerns compliance with the antidumping order discussed below, not any 
conspiracy; that its date bears no relation to the date of the alleged conspiracy; and that even if there were a conspiracy, this 
document implicates only Flexfil, and not any of the other distributors. This argument at best creates a genuine issue of fact that 
is not appropriately resolved at this stage of the litigation. "
929,31," This contention assumes that the conspiracy includes only the manufacturers, allegations against the distributors having fallen 
victim, presumably, to the strictures of Estate Construction. To be sure, the result reached in Part IV is to the contrary: the 
allegations against the distributors survive. In this event, of course, the Illinois Brick issue disappears (with one exception) 
because plaintiffs are no longer indirect purchasers. The exception concerns the non-joinder of Globe and JPS as defendants in 
this action. See infra notes 38-42 and accompanying text."
929,32," Illinois Brick was based on an earlier Supreme Court case, Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 
20 L. Ed. 2d 1231, 88 S. Ct. 2224 (1968). In Hanover Shoe, the Supreme Court rejected the antitrust defendant's argument that 
the plaintiff suffered no injury because it had ""passed on"" to its own customers any overcharge that it might have incurred as a 
result of the defendant's anticompetitive pricing. See 392 U.S. at 494. Illinois Brick presented the inverse issue, namely, whether 
an antitrust plaintiff could make offensive use of the pass-on theory. The indirect-purchaser plaintiffs in Illinois Brick alleged that 
the defendants, concrete-block manufacturers, charged their customers anticompetitive prices, and that those prices were then 
passed on to the plaintiffs. Consistent with its Hanover Shoe decision denying defendants a pass-on defense, the Supreme 
Court in Illinois Brick disallowed plaintiffs from invoking the pass-on theory as well."
929,33," Though the practical result of the Illinois Brick holding is that certain entities will be barred from bringing suit, the Supreme 
Court was careful to point out that its decision was not based on principles of standing, but on those of antitrust injury: ""The 
question of which persons have been injured by an illegal overcharge for purposes of § 4 is analytically distinct from the question 
of which persons have sustained injuries too remote to give them standing to sue for damages under § 4."" 431 U.S. at 728 n.7. "
930,34," Again, reliance on this exception affords an alternative basis for denying the motions to dismiss. But it is an important basis to 
establish, because if plaintiffs are unable to prove liability on the distributors' part at trial, then they will be deemed indirect 
purchasers from the manufacturer-conspirators, in which case the Illinois Brick problem would arise anew. For a similar 
approach, see In re Brand Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litigation, 123 F.3d 599, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 22267, 1997 WL 
471819 at *3 (7th Cir. 1997) (deciding the Illinois Brick issue as an alternate basis for its ruling)."
930,35," Though the Supreme Court stated firmly in one later case that there are no exceptions to the indirect-purchaser rule of Illinois 
Brick, it did not explicitly renounce the language of footnote 16. See Kansas v. Utilicorp United, 497 U.S. 199, 216-17, 111 L. Ed. 
2d 169, 110 S. Ct. 2807 (1990) (refusing to create an exception for purchasers from utilities that allegedly passed on to their 
customers all of the costs they had incurred as a result of anticompetitive prices charged by a gas pipeline). Specifically, the 
Supreme Court stated that ""ample justification exists for our stated decision not to 'carve out exceptions to the [indirect 
purchaser] rule for particular types of markets.'"" Id. at 216 (quoting Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 744). That comment, however, was 
made in the context of a plaintiff seeking an exception for a particular industry, not an exception for certain corporate structures 
and relationships (as is the case with the ownership-control exception)."
930,36," See, e.g., In re Wyoming Tight Sands Antitrust Cases (Kansas v. Amoco Production Co.), 866 F.2d 1286, 1293 (10th Cir. 
1989) (recognizing, but refusing to apply, the control exception); Illinois ex rel.  Hartigan v. Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co.,

958, 968 n.22 (3rd Cir. 1983) (same); In re Mid-Atlantic Toyota Antitrust Litigation, 516 F. Supp. 1287, 1293 (D. Md. 1981)

Works, 480 F. Supp. 1091, 1102 (D. Md. 1979) (explaining that ""the exception could be stated as the situation where a seller 
owns or controls its customer, who then sells directly to plaintiff""); cf.  Jewish Hosp. Ass'n v. Stewart Mechanical Enterps., 628 
F.2d 971, 975 (6th Cir. 1980) (limiting the control exception ""to relationships involving such functional economic or other unity 
between the direct purchaser and . . . the defendant . . . that there effectively has been only one sale"")."
930,37," As an example of this control, plaintiffs note that Rubberflex has reported to the Department of Commerce that some of its 
sales in the United States went through Flexfil (NC), its subsidiary, only as an agent; that Flexfil does the sales paperwork, but 
that the thread never passes into its inventory or accounting records; and that Rubberflex ships directly to its American 
customers. See Plaintiffs' Reply to Renewed Motion to Dismiss of Malaysian Defendants, Exh. D. "
931,38," ""A plaintiff's complete, voluntary, and substantially equal participation in an illegal practice under the antitrust laws precludes 
recovery for that antitrust violation."" Sullivan v. National Football League, 34 F.3d 1091, 1107 (1st Cir. 1994) (internal quotation 
marks omitted); cf.  Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, Inc. v. Berner, 472 U.S. 299, 310, 86 L. Ed. 2d 215, 105 S. Ct. 2622 (1985)

not a defense in antitrust actions))). The Supreme Court in Perma Life reserved the question whether ""truly complete 
involvement and participation in a monopolistic scheme could ever be a basis, wholly apart from the idea of in pari delicto, for 
barring a plaintiff's cause of action."" 392 U.S. at 140. The Fourth Circuit posited its own answer to that question three years later, 
based on the majority and concurring opinions of Perma Life: ""When parties of substantially equal economic strength mutually 
participate in the formulation and execution of the scheme and bear equal responsibility for the consequent restraint of trade, 
each is barred from seeking treble damages from each other."" Columbia Nitrogen Corp. v. Royster Co., 451 F.2d 3, 15-16 (4th 
Cir. 1971)."
931,39," See, e.g., Link v. Mercedes-Benz of North Amer., Inc., 788 F.2d 918, 931 (3rd Cir. 1986) (stating that Illinois Brick doctrine 
applies to vertical-conspiracy cases); In re Midwest Milk Monopolization Litigation, 730 F.2d 528, 531 (8th Cir. 1984) (same)."
931,40," It appears from the parties' papers that one reason plaintiffs may not have named Globe as a defendant is that plaintiffs' 
counsel represented Globe in an antidumping proceeding in 1993. Joinder of Globe thus might disqualify plaintiffs' counsel. 
Because there is nothing in the record to support this theory, however, and because its validity has no bearing on the disposition 
of the instant motions, no view on the matter is expressed. JPS was named as a defendant in the original and first amended complaints, but not in the second amended complaint. See 
supra note 4. "
932,41," The Ninth Circuit has noted that ""there is little reason for the price-fixer to fear a direct purchaser's suit when the direct 
purchaser is a subsidiary or division of a co-conspirator."" Royal Printing Co. v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 621 F.2d 323, 326 (9th Cir. 
1980). The court went on to recognize that there could be some instances in which the subsidiary might in fact sue the parent -- 
for instance, in a derivative action brought by outside shareholders. In that event, however, the court stated that the ""small risk of 
multiple recovery"" did not tip the balance in favor of the defendants. See id. If, as the facts develop in this case, it appears that 
suit by one of the distributors against its parent is likely, or at least more than a remote possibility, and that there is thus a 
possibility of duplicative liability, defendants may raise this issue again at that time. Only a year after Illinois Brick was decided, the Third Circuit, relying on footnote 16 of Illinois Brick, allowed a plaintiff that 
purchased from a subsidiary corporation to maintain an action against the parent corporation. The Third Circuit explained: ""To 
adopt any other view would invite evasion by the simple expedient of inserting a subsidiary between the violator and the first 
noncontrolled purchaser."" In re Sugar Antitrust Litigation (Stotter & Co. v. Amstar Corp.), 579 F.2d 13, 19 (3rd Cir. 1978). That 
observation has particular force in light of the facts of this case. "

and Square D))."
933,44, Defendants' Reply to Plaintiff's Opposition to Defendants' [Original] Motion to Dismiss at 2. 
934,45," By way of illustration, assume that the competitive price in the United States for extruded rubber thread is $ 1.00 per pound. 
Assume further that defendants sell their product in Malaysia for $ 1.40 a pound, and that they conspire to fix the U.S. price at $ 
1.20 a pound. In that case, they would be subject both to the antidumping duty -- for charging $ 0.20 less than the fair value -- 
and to liability under the antitrust laws -- for conspiring to fix prices at an anticompetitive level. In any event, to the extent, if any, that the antidumping laws and the antitrust laws establish conflicting goals, that is a matter for 
Congress, and not the courts, to resolve."
934,46," In their briefs, plaintiffs assert that companies subject to antidumping orders can lower the fair value of their product (by 
charging a lower price in the home country), contract with a U.S. importer who is willing to pay the tax, or simply accept and pay 
the antidumping duties. See Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' [Original] Motion to Dismiss at 7."
934,47," See also In re Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litigation, 998 F.2d 1144 (3rd Cir. 1993). In Lower Lake Erie, the Third 
Circuit refused to apply the Keogh doctrine to bar an antitrust complaint against certain railroads, even though the defendants 
had filed approved rates with the ICC. To hold that there was no injury, said the court, ""would overextend Keogh's reach and 
could produce a rule that one who pays for services governed by ICC tariffs is foreclosed from asserting that antitrust violations 
prevented use of a less expensive, equivalent service."" Id. at 1159. In other words, said the Third Circuit, Keogh does not shield 
an antitrust violator from liability for anticompetitive conduct that is outside the control of a governmental agency. See id. Most 
instructive for present purposes, perhaps, is the Third Circuit's observation that it was ""fully consistent with Keogh . . . to accept 
these rates as lawful and nonetheless to conclude that through non-rate activities . . . the railroads effectively retarded entry of 
lower cost competitors to the market."" Id. Here, as in Lower Lake Erie, it is fully consistent to treat the prices charged by the 
Malaysian entities as below fair value and nonetheless to conclude that those entities conspired to maintain anticompetitive 
prices. "
937,*," Honorable Stephen N. Limbaugh, Senior U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri, sitting by designation. "
941,1," Professor Areeda describes a similar problem as the ""time factor"" of market power. It is illustrative here as well: A defendant's market power may be greater in the very short run than in some longer period. Buyers shift quite rapidly 
among substantially identical products when relative prices change, quickly revealing the cross-elasticity of demand 
between brands X and Y. Shifts may take more time when substitute products differ significantly in their physical 
characteristics. A coal-burning boiler may not be readily convertible to natural gas; a baker's wrapping machine may handle 
only cellophane, not wax paper. Despite a rising relative price for coal or cellophane, shifting to gas or paper may not be 
economical for these users until their boilers or wrapping machines ""wear out."" Consequently, demand shifts may be 
gradual, thus delaying their full impact on price for several years, during which the defendant's power would be declining. AREEDA, Vol. IIA, P 530c. "
947,1," As alleged in paragraph 11 of plaintiff's complaint and as admitted in defendants' respective answers thereto, ""the Lehigh 
Valley area is generally bounded by the cities of Allentown, Bethlehem and Easton and consists of the counties of Lehigh and 
Northampton in Pennsylvania."
947,2," For a surgeon, staff privileges equate with the right to perform surgery at a given hospital. Thus, if a surgeon is without 
privileges at any hospital, he is effectively foreclosed from practicing his chosen specialty."
947,3," Although at the time he first began practicing in the Lehigh Valley, Dr. Angelico had full active privileges in surgery at Lehigh 
Valley Hospital, Allentown Hospital, Sacred Heart Hospital and subsequently St. Luke's Hospital, by March 1994, plaintiff only 
had full active privileges at St. Luke's and courtesy privileges at Lehigh Valley Hospitals. (Pl.'s Dep., 22-23, 39-40. 104, 138). As 
he had only courtesy privileges at Lehigh Valley Hospital, plaintiff could not perform more than twelve surgical procedures there 
per year. (Pl.'s Dep., 22-23, 39-40, 104, 138). "
949,4," Per se  violations involve agreements whose nature and necessary effect are so plainly anticompetitive that no elaborate study 
of the industry is needed to establish their illegality. Per se illegal restraints on trade such as boycotts and price fixing do not 
require proof of market power.  Lie v. St. Joseph Hospital of Mount Clements, Mich., 964 F.2d 567, 569 (6th Cir. 1992), citing 
National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 692, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 1365, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1978)

950,5," These definitions of product and geographic markets are supported by the affidavit of plaintiff's ""rebuttal"" expert, John Beyer. 
(Pl's Exhibit ""P""). Defendants' anti-trust expert, Barry Harris in turn, more narrowly defines the product market as being that of 
the professional or technical component of cardiac surgery services and the geographic market as consisting of Lehigh Valley 
Hospital, Easton Hospital and St. Luke's Hospital. (Defendants' Exhibit ""D""). "
951,6," Mr. Podrat also opined that a negative impact may be inferred from Dr. Angelico's absence in that the data from HC4, Mediqual 
and St. Luke's Hospital suggested that his patients historically were discharged more quickly with fewer complications and at the 
expected mortality rate such that plaintiff and the institution(s) at which he practiced could have been attractive to existing and 
prospective payors, specifically managed care plans. (Podrat Dep., 121-124, 143-149, 229-230). This opinion notwithstanding, 
plaintiff's expert freely admitted that he has no idea whether any managed care companies actually so considered Dr. Angelico 
or whether they used him ""as a benchmark"" to negotiate provider service contracts with any institution. (Podrat Dep., 125). "

with defendant Donneybrooke Motor Racing Equipment, Inc. The district court dismissed all claims against Donneybrooke, and it 
is not party to this appeal."
967,2," After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties' request for a 
decision on the briefs without oral argument. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1.9. The case is therefore ordered 
submitted without oral argument."
967,3," The Spec Racer was previously called a ""Sports Renault,"" and both terms are used in the record."
967,4," At least, he was a member and racer at the time this litigation began. SCCA has since expelled him and revoked his racing 
license, in part for bringing this action. See Freeman v. Sports Car Club of Am., Inc., 51 F.3d 1358 (7th Cir. 1995)."
967,5," Because Enterprises is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SCCA and defendants stated in the district court, and reaffirmed in this 
court, that ""SCCA and Enterprises must be deemed a single entity under antitrust law,"" Appellants' App. at 166-67, we consider 
them to be a single entity for purposes of the antitrust portions of this appeal. Cf.  Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube "

enterprise for Sherman Act § 1 purposes)."
968,6," To some extent, plaintiffs' individual counts have metamorphosed from the time of their amended complaint through summary 
judgment briefing and, to a lesser extent, into this appeal. On appeal, defendants have questioned the propriety of plaintiffs 
articulating arguments in summary judgment briefing that were not stated in their complaint. However, in the absence of a district 
court ruling that plaintiffs could not amend their complaint through subsequent motions to conform to available evidence, we 
decline to prevent plaintiffs from raising issues which were presented on summary judgment and which defendants had an 
opportunity to address in their reply brief to plaintiffs' opposition to summary judgment. Moreover, our interpretation of plaintiffs' 
claims as refined on appeal apply only in so far as they have an adequate predicate in the district court. However, our indulgence to plaintiffs' moving claims, poorly constructed and incomplete arguments, and failure to properly raise 
issues have limits, as indicated by our conclusion that they have waived Counts III and IV."
968,7," On appeal, plaintiffs have more fully elaborated on their primary claims of injury. Freeman claims he was damaged in the 
following manner: It is clear that both would-be competitors in the tied product market as well as actual buyers in the tied product market who 
were coerced into buying products in the tied market, have standing to challenge a tying arrangement as unlawful under § 1 
of the Sherman Act. As a consequence of SCCA's violation of antitrust law, SCCA forced its members, including Freeman, 
to pay higher prices for Spec Racer cars and parts than the prices available in the open market from Chrysler Motors for 
example. As a car owner, Freeman was forced individually to pay these higher prices. Therefore, Freeman as an individual 
suffered direct and specific harm as a result of SCCA's unlawful and anti-competitive practices and [has] standing to 
challenge these practices. Appellants' Opening Br. at 18-19 (record citations omitted). SRS described its injury as follows: "
969,," It is also undisputed that SRS was prohibited from manufacturing and distributing Spec Racers and Shelby Can Am race 
cars and parts for these cars by SCCA's rules, which impose fines and disqualifications for the use of parts not purchased 
from Enterprises. Accordingly, SRS was directly and substantially harmed by SCCA's and Enterprises' per se illegal and 
anti-competitive practices in the form of artificially inflated prices and the inability to freely compete for customers in the 
market for Spec Racers and Shelby Can Am race cars and parts and service for these cars. Id. at 26 (record citations omitted)."
969,8," The claimed tying violation in Count III involved an alleged tie between Spec Racer cars and Spec Racer replacement parts. 
SRS did not raise that claim in its response to summary judgment and has not raised it in this appeal. The claimed tie between 
racing services and Spec Racer cars and parts that SRS articulated in response to defendants' summary judgment motion 
cannot be brought under Clayton Act § 3, because Clayton Act § 3 only covers tying arrangements in which products are tied to 
other products. See 15 U.S.C. § 14 (prohibiting certain contracts for sale of ""goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies, or 
other commodities""). See IX Phillip E. Areeda, Antitrust Law P 1700e, at 10 (1991) (noting the lack of importance of § 3's 
limitations because § 3 ""applies only to 'commodities' for resale within the United States"" and ""because the Sherman Act applies 
without such limitations and the substantive standard of legality is essentially the same under both statutes""). SRS also failed to 
raise any arguments in the summary judgment response in the district court or on appeal that it has standing to assert an 
exclusive dealing claim under Clayton Act § 3. We therefore conclude that SRS has waived its Clayton Act § 3 claims."
969,9," As to Count IV, plaintiffs failed to present any argument in response to defendants' summary judgment motion supporting their 
contention that they had standing to pursue this claim. On appeal, they have made several broad, conclusory statements 
regarding this claim, such as that SRS was foreclosed from competing in the Shelby Can Am market. However, they have not 
explained who Shelby Technologies is, what relationship it has to defendants (other than the fact that SCCA sanctions races for 
its cars and requires racers to purchase cars and parts from Shelby Technologies), nor whether defendants have any interest in 
or control over sales of Shelby Technologies' products. Thus, not only did plaintiffs fail to argue standing to assert this count in 
the district court, they have failed to make a serious attempt to demonstrate how the court erred in denying standing on this 
count. See Rademacher v. Colorado Ass'n of Soil Conservation Dists. Med. Benefit Plan, 11 F.3d 1567, 1571 (10th Cir. 1993); 
Hernandez v. Starbuck, 69 F.3d 1089, 1093 (10th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 134 L. Ed. 2d 954, 116 S. Ct. 1855 (1996). "

] The Supreme Court has described the elements of a Sherman Act § 2 monopolization claim as follows: "
973,," The offense of monopoly under § 2 of the Sherman Act has two elements: (1) the possession of monopoly power in the 
relevant market and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as 
a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident. United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-71, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778, 86 S. Ct. 1698 (1966). HN3[

(10th Cir. 1991)."
973,11," The court did address SRS's more limited claim that defendants' anticompetitive activities somehow prevented it from selling 
fiberglass car bodies to Enterprises. As to that claim, we agree with the district court that SRS has not shown that Enterprises' 
refusal to purchase fiberglass bodies from SRS related to any antitrust violation. Rather, the undisputed evidence shows that the 
fiberglass did not meet Enterprises' specifications. "
974,12," SRS also claims it was injured because it was unable to ""consummate the sale of the business"" after it was terminated as a 
CSR and that after termination as a CSR, it was not able to purchase parts except at inflated prices. As noted earlier, the district 
court rejected the first claim on the basis that any injury resulted from Enterprises' right to terminate its contract with SRS and 
not from any antitrust violation. On appeal, SRS has failed to present any argument showing how its inability to sell its business 
resulted from any antitrust violation and has thus failed to show how the district court erred. As to the second claim that after 
termination as a CSR, it could not purchase parts except at inflated prices, that claim is barred by the direct purchaser rule, 
because SRS could only be an indirect purchaser of cars and parts once it was no longer a CSR. We thus reject both of these 
claims."
974,13," In their reply brief on appeal, plaintiffs for the first time in this case contend that defendants also established an illegal tying 
arrangement involving Shelby Can Ams. We consider this issue waived because, as noted earlier, plaintiffs never have 
explained the relationship between Shelby Technologies and defendants, how CSRs were involved in this relationship (SRS 
does not appear to have been a CSR for Shelby Can Ams), who sells Shelby Can Ams, or otherwise how this tying arrangement 
worked. See Headrick v. Rockwell Int'l Corp., 24 F.3d 1272, 1277-78 (10th Cir. 1994)."
974,14," Like any other claim under § 1 of the Sherman Act, plaintiffs' tying claim must be based on the existence of an agreement 
between two or more parties in restraint of trade. ""Section 1 does not proscribe purely unilateral activity by a single entity."" 
Systemcare, Inc. v. Wang Lab., Inc., 117 F.3d 1137, 1140 (10th Cir. 1997). At the time the parties filed their briefs in this case, 
the law in this circuit, as stated in City of Chanute, 955 F.2d at 650-51, was that a sale agreement between a plaintiff-buyer and 
a defendant-seller did not satisfy the agreement element of § 1 without a further showing that the defendant had conspired with 
another party. The only agreement that appears to effectuate the alleged illegal tie is the one between defendants and the racers 
(the tied parties) participating in SCCA's racing events. The racers must agree to use Enterprises cars and parts in order to get 
racing services. That agreement is essentially a sale agreement between a plaintiff-buyer and defendant-seller that appeared to 
be inadequate under City of Chanute to satisfy the § 1 requirement of an agreement. However, while this appeal was pending, the en banc court undertook reconsideration of the City of Chanute rule in the 
Systemcare case. We abated this appeal pending our decision in Systemcare, and the ultimate decision by the en banc court 
overruled City of Chanute on this point. See Systemcare, 117 F.3d at 1145. "
975,," Thus, for the purposes of this case, a buyer's agreement with a seller to buy one product (here racing services) only on the 
condition of buying another product from that seller (here cars and parts), or on the condition of refraining from purchasing the 
product from another source, satisfies the agreement element of a Sherman Act § 1 offense. As Professor Areeda has 
explained, ""the 'contract, combination, or conspiracy' that triggers § 1 is obviously present when the buyer promises to take his 
requirements of the second product from a supplier as an express quid pro quo for being allowed to buy the tying product. More 
generally, the purchase of the second product is inherently an agreement."" IX Areeda, supra, P 1700i, at 12. "
977,15," The only other possible party here would be SRS, but it is not tied nor can we see how it was injured by the tie. SRS is ""tied"" 
only in the sense that if it wants to sell cars and parts to Freeman and other racers to use in SCCA-sanctioned Spec Racer 
races, it must buy these cars and parts from Enterprises. This is the basis for SRS's monopolization claim, which is obviously 
related to but analytically distinct from the tying claim. Because the tying product purchasers (here, the purchasers of racing 
services) are the targeted victims of an illegal tying arrangement, these purchasers are in the best position to identify an illegal 
tie and have the most incentive to bring an action to enforce the prohibition against tying. "
979,16," SRS does not argue on appeal that the district court misinterpreted § 23-2-2.7-5 by requiring the franchisee to sell both 
automobiles and/or trucks and gas and/or oil. That is a literal reading of the statute, though we have some doubt as to whether 
the Indiana legislature intended that the franchisee sell both automobiles and/or trucks and gasoline and/or oil. See Montgomery 
v. Amoco Oil Co., 804 F.2d 1000, 1003 (7th Cir. 1986) (stating in dicta that ""an agreement which relates to the business of 
selling gasoline and/or oil, primarily for use in vehicles, is a franchise agreement"" under Indiana law). Nevertheless, because 
neither party appeals the legal interpretation given by the district court of the statute, we accept the interpretation given below as 
the rule of the case. "
980,17," Neither in the district court, such as in a motion for reconsideration, nor on appeal has SRS stated that it could produce 
evidence it sold gasoline or oil. "
987,1," HN2[
] The Federal Trade Commission requires franchisors to disclose certain information to all prospective franchisees. See"
987,16, C.F.R. § 436.1 (1995). 
993,2," This Court declined to follow the district court's opinion in Queen City in its earlier decision on defendants' motion to dismiss 
largely because the Queen City court appeared to decide, as a matter of law, that Kodak issues could never arise in a franchise 
context. "
994,3," Milton Rizan contends that he received the UFOC and franchise contract on the day he signed his contract. Accepting this 
assertion as true, he still had the opportunity to learn the terms of the deal before he signed up as a SpeeDee franchisee and 
paid his money. "
995,4," Plaintiffs also rely on comparisons between prices for packaged Mobil motor oil sold at retail in California to consumers to 
prices for bulk oil sold by Mobil to SpeeDee franchisees. (See Pls.' Mem. Opp. Defs.' Mot. Summ. J., Exhs. 1, 3, 4, & 7.) "
996,," Plaintiffs have produced no evidence of Mobil's prices to retailers for packaged oil. Nor is it obvious that retail prices and bulk oil 
prices provide any meaningful point of comparison to determine whether Mobil's prices to plaintiffs were supracompetitive. "
1001,1," ""Petroleum dispensing equipment"" includes dozens of products, from the canopies that protect motorists from the rain, to the 
vapor recovery systems that capture escaping fumes. Only the retail dispensers are here at issue."
1001,2," Another 500-600 companies sell petroleum dispensing equipment other than dispensers. Some of these are appointed 
""authorized service contractors"" (""ASCs""). They provide warranty work and install and repair dispensing equipment, and 
occasionally become authorized distributors. Plaintiff ATS-Kelley was an ASC before becoming an authorized Gilbarco 
distributor."
1001,3," Gilbarco was the first manufacturer to introduce ""multi-product dispensers"" which allow customers to obtain different grades of 
fuel from the same dispenser. "
1003,4," Plaintiffs cast their argument in terms of ""entry barriers,"" while Gilbarco discusses ""foreclosure from the relevant market."" Aside 
from the status of the allegedly affected competitors, i.e., incumbent firms or new entrants, we perceive little meaningful 
difference. "
1004,5," The ASCs do not operate under exclusive arrangements, which renders them even more accessible to competitors."
1004,6, Paragraph 11(a) of Gilbarco's Domestic Distributor Agreement provides: 
1005,," This Agreement shall have an initial term of one (1) year from the date first written above and continue thereafter until 
terminated. Either party shall have the option to terminate this Agreement, with or without cause, at the end of such initial 
term or at anytime thereafter upon sixty (60) days prior written notice."
1005,7," Plaintiffs contend that Koppens and Tatsuno, two foreign dispenser manufacturers, were deterred by exclusive dealing, but cite 
no credible supporting evidence. The testimony of Roy Sutton, president of Goode-Omega, that Koppens' entry failed due to a 
lack of distribution is insufficient for two reasons. First, it was admitted speculation, which the jury was not entitled to credit. 
Second, even if the jury were entitled to rely on his testimony, it is insufficient to establish that exclusive dealing caused the 
failed distribution. "
1006,8," The Washington exclusive dealing statute, Washington Revised Code § 19.86.050, contains language substantially similar to 
the Clayton Act, and the plaintiffs' unfair competition claim under Washington Revised Code § 19.86.020 is premised on 
exclusive dealing. Because construction of these provisions is to be ""guided by final decisions of the federal courts . . . 
interpreting the various federal statutes dealing with the same or similar matters,"" Washington Revised Code § 19.86.920, our 
conclusion with regard to the Clayton Act claim disposes of these claims."
1006,9," The statute renders it ""unlawful for any person . . . to [sell], or to have any contract . . . to sell any goods in this State upon 
condition that the purchaser thereof shall not deal in the goods of a competitor."" The statute was repealed ""to ensure"" that North 
Carolina's antitrust laws are ""consistent with federal antitrust laws."" 1995 N.C. Sess. Laws 550. "
1007,10," John Reynolds testified that while he was negotiating for his distributorship, Gilbarco's district manager told him that he ""was 
looking for a long-term distributor. As their agreement or their letter says, a partnership."""
1007,11," Omega cites to the testimony of Walter Gavin, sales manager of Gilbarco North America, in support of its argument. We 
believe that it succinctly demonstrates why Omega's claim fails as a matter of law: A: The policy had to do with dealing with competitors that were owned by competitors or dealing with companies that had 
multi brands of equipment. It so happened that Omega was a company that fit that description. [] We would have made the 
same decision if it were some other company rather than Omega. . . . Q: And you knew it would interfere with Omega's . . . ability to acquire other Gilbarco distributors, correct? A: Well, yeah, I guess it would do that. But I'm not interested in what is good for Omega. I'm interested in what is good for 
Gilbarco. And it's clear to me that dealing with Omega is not good for Gilbarco. Good luck, go out and compete. "
1008,12, Our conclusion in the main appeal obviates the need to address plaintiffs' other contentions.
1008,13," Plaintiffs also contend that they proved that Rochester and Gilbarco agreed to the exclusive dealing policy in restraint of trade. 
Our conclusion that Gilbarco's distributor policy did not violate the Clayton Act disposes of this contention. If an exclusive dealing 
arrangement ""does not fall within the broader proscription of § 3 of the Clayton Act[,] it follows that it is not forbidden by [§§ 1 and 
2 of the Sherman Act]."" Tampa Electric, 365 U.S. at 335. "
1009,1," Professor Leffler is a Professor of Economics from the University of Washington. Professor Leffler has expertise in the subject 
of exclusive dealing arrangements. "
1010,2," A ""retail"" petroleum dispenser is sold by the manufacturer to an official distributor at a wholesale price, for re-sale by the 
distributor to an end-user at retail price. A ""commercial"" petroleum dispenser is sold by an official distributor to a buyer at a price 
above wholesale. Distributors of different brands of ""retail"" petroleum dispensers can purchase ""commercial"" petroleum 
dispensers from each other at this higher price."
1010,3," Gilbarco communicates to its distributors through its DAC. The other major manufacturers of retail petroleum dispensers also 
use DACs. "
1011,4," The Supreme Court in Tampa also referred to the area of competition as the ""relevant market."" See Tampa, 365 U.S. at 328. "
1012,5," Both Jefferson and Twin City involved examinations of the anticompetitive effect of exclusive dealing arrangements under 
section one of the Sherman Act. 15 U.S.C. § 1. In Twin City, we held that ""a greater showing of anticompetitive effect is required 
to establish a Sherman Act violation than a section three Clayton Act violation in exclusive-dealing cases."" Twin City, 676 F.2d at 
1304 n.9. Thus, less evidence is needed to preserve a jury verdict on a § 3 Clayton Act claim on appeal than would be needed 
to preserve a jury verdict on a Sherman Act claim. "
1014,6," The majority points to the entry of Schlumberger as evidence that new manufacturers of retail petroleum dispensers could enter 
the United States market. The evidence presented at trial regarding Schlumberger was mixed. Professor Leffler testified that 
Schlumberger has not been successful in establishing a distribution network and still does not have representation in all parts of 
the United States. We are not free to disturb the jury's decision to believe the substantial evidence presented at trial that entry 
barriers do prevent new manufacturers from entering the United States retail petroleum dispenser market. "
1016,7," Omega's witnesses testified about Gilbarco's relationship to the major oil companies. It is not clear from the record whether the 
term ""major oil companies"" is meant to include large convenience store chains or refers only to major oil companies. "

general rules of law provided by legislators for the decision of those disputes, and is not based on the general rules of law 
extracted from judicial precedent. The accumulated precedents gain significance because the words of the legislation, as 
consistently spoken by judges in their decisions, are attributed to the legislator, and the meaning of the rule of law enacted 
by the legislator is taken from the specific meaning given to it by judges. Further, the judge analyzes those judicial 
decisions to determine whether or not they comprise a general rule of law consistent with the needs of the pending case. If 
what he finds does not fit the needs of the case, then he may disregard the law as spoken by the judges and ""return to the 
words of the general rule of law spoken by the legislator, under the theory that judges are bound to apply the law as given 
to them by the legislature and not as paraphrased by other judges."" Id. at 4. (Footnotes omitted). "
1042,4," Plaintiffs do not claim that they are the immediate buyers from the defendants, the alleged antitrust violators. Rather, plaintiffs

Uniack (1984) 158 Cal. App. 3d 777, 784, fn. 7, 205 Cal. Rptr. 62.) Code of Civil Procedure section 631.8 is intended in a proper

1120,7," Section 17071.5, pertaining to sale of products below cost on terms that limit quantity purchasable by any one customer, is 
analogous to section 17071. Both sections provide that upon a certain showing, there arises a presumption ""of the purpose or 
intent to injure competitors or destroy competition."" ( §§ 17071, 17071.5.) "
1121,8," We commend the trial court herein for its astute handling of this issue. In a pretrial ruling, the trial court recognized that 
Dooley's and Western Union are ""diametrically opposed."" The trial court then proceeded to examine the application of the two 
types of presumptions, and concluded the public policy implications require the instant presumption to be one affecting the 
burden of proof. "
1123,9," Contrary to the trial court's ruling there was no evidence that L. A. Cellular knew its pricing was substantially certain to result in 
injury to plaintiffs, the record contains substantial evidence such injury was readily foreseeable. David Stevens, who had served 
as L. A. Cellular's vice president of sales and marketing and then acting president, testified: ""Q. Now, in fact L. A. Cellular could not continue in the equipment business on that basis [selling below cost] if that were the only 
business it were in, could it? ""A. I don't know how to answer that. I am not sure we would want to. ""Q. If you had enough money, you could. But it wouldn't be a desirable business decision; is that what you are saying? ""A. It [is] a very hypothetical question. It is probably a business I would not be interested in. ""Q. Eventually you would run yourself into the ground? ""A. Yes. ""Q. And basically it is because you have a profitable service business that you can continue in the equipment business, is it not? ""A. Well, I think we started out saying that we are in the equipment business to support the service business. ""Q. And these figures just illustrate that fact, don't they? ""A. The figures illustrate we lost money on equipment. I guess you can draw that conclusion from them. ""Q. You didn't have a reason for losing money on equipment to be giving away money. You wanted to support your service 
business? ""A. Correct."" (Italics added.) Thus, it was certainly foreseeable L. A. Cellular's below cost equipment sales would injure plaintiffs. However, as discussed 
above, to impose liability the statutory scheme requires a defendant act with the specific intent to injure competitors or to destroy 
competition. ( § 17071; Western Union Financial Services, Inc., supra, 20 Cal. App. 4th at p. 1540, fn. 10.) Here, as discussed, 
L. A. Cellular established its intent was simply to compete with AirTouch for subscribers, and that the harm to plaintiffs was 
unintended."
1123,10, Gawora did not testify at trial but her deposition was admitted into evidence and relied on by the trial court. 
1126,11," Plaintiffs cite Albrecht v. Herald Co. (1968) 390 U.S. 145 [19 L. Ed. 2d 998, 88 S. Ct. 869], overruled on other grounds by 
State Oil Co. v. Khan, 1997 U.S. LEXIS 6705 (Nov. 4, 1997, No. 96-871)     U.S.    , 97 Daily Journal D.A.R. 13619, for the 
proposition that even where a defendant does not enter into an agreement with a third party to restrain trade, a combination in 
restraint of trade arises when the third party materially aids a restraint of trade. Because the Cartwright Act is patterned upon the 
federal Sherman Anti-Trust Act (15 U.S.C § 1 et seq.), ""federal cases interpreting the Sherman Act are applicable with respect to 
the Cartwright Act. [Citations.]"" ( Chicago Title Ins. Co. v. Great Western Financial Corp. (1968) 69 Cal. 2d 305, 315, 70 Cal. 
Rptr. 849, 444 P.2d 481; accord Cellular Plus, Inc. v. Superior Court (1993) 14 Cal. App. 4th 1224, 1240.) In Albrecht, a 
newspaper company hired another company to solicit subscribers away from an independent carrier, to force the independent 
carrier to charge no more than the suggested retail price for the newspaper. Such conduct was held to constituted an illegal 
restraint of trade under the Sherman Act. ( Albrecht, supra, at p. 153.) Albrecht found the newspaper company's ""conduct cannot 
be deemed wholly unilateral and beyond the reach of . . . the Sherman Act"" in that ""a combination arose between [the 
newspaper company], [the company which solicited the carrier's customers], and [the new carrier] to force [the first carrier] to 
conform to the advertised retail price."" ( Id., at p. 149, italics added.) Albrecht is plainly distinguishable. Here, unlike in Albrecht, the evidence established there was no coercive conduct by the 
defendant to secure the compliance of others in restraint of trade. L. A. Cellular did not take coercive action against either its 
agents or against plaintiffs. As the trial court found, L. A. Cellular made clear in its written communications with its agents, and in 
its advertisements, that each agent was free to set its own prices. "
1128,12," L. A. Cellular contends these guidelines are no longer being followed by the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC). According 
to L. A. Cellular, a 1980 policy statement by the FTC stands for the proposition that the most important factor in evaluating the 
fairness of a business practice is substantial injury to consumers, regardless of its effect on competitors. However, the FTC's 
1980 policy statement cited by L. A. Cellular solely addresses the issue of the FTC's jurisdiction over unfair acts and practices 
directed at consumers. The policy statement states unequivocally: ""The Commission's jurisdiction over 'unfair methods of 
competition' is not discussed in this letter."" (Trade Regulation Reporter (CCH), P 13,203, Consumer Unfairness (June 23, 1988), 
italics added.) Moreover, the pertinent statute here is section 17200, which is intended ""to protect competitors as well as 
consumers. [Citation.]"" ( Tippett v. Terich (1995) 37 Cal. App. 4th 1517, 1536.) "
1129,13," In view of these authorities, we are unpersuaded by L. A. Cellular's argument the law is too vague to guide businesses in their 
conduct or courts in the application of section 17200. (See also, People ex rel. Mosk v. National Research Co. of Cal. (1962) 201 
Cal. App. 2d 765, 771-772, 20 Cal. Rptr. 516, rejecting contention that Civil Code former section 3369 was unconstitutionally 
void for uncertainty and vagueness [""there is . . . a definite background of experience and precedence to illuminate the meaning 
of the words employed in the statute""].) "
1130,14," There is no merit to L. A. Cellular's contention plaintiffs' real complaint is with the federal regulatory scheme which limits 
service providers to two carriers per area. While L. A. Cellular is entitled to enjoy its government-granted duopoly position in the 
service market, the federal government did not grant L. A. Cellular any special privileges in the equipment market. L. A. 
Cellular's below-cost sales of cellular equipment are within the reach of state law. "
1131,15," As for the impact on consumers, L. A. Cellular's discounted sales of cellular telephones did not necessarily benefit consumers 
who bought them. L. A. Cellular recouped its equipment losses many times over through what it earned in service charges. The 
evidence showed, for example, that in December 1993, L. A. Cellular incurred a loss of $ 1,294,340 on equipment sales, but had 
a margin on nonequipment of $ 20,165,319, for a total operating margin of $ 18,870,979. As indicated, section 17200 is intended 
to protect consumers as well as competitors. ( Tippett, supra, 37 Cal. App. 4th at p. 1536.) "
1132,16," Bundling is the practice of ""the combined sale of discounted cellular telephone equipment and tariffed cellular service."" (Re 
Regulation of Cellular Radiotelephone Utilities, supra, 59 Cal. P.U.C.2d at p. 196.)"
1132,17," Although L. A. Cellular asserts it was simply meeting the competitive challenge posed by AirTouch, plaintiffs did not proceed 
against the latter, raising the issue whether AirTouch in fact was engaging in similar practices."
1132,18," With respect to available remedies, ""HN26[
] section 17203 authorizes a trial court to order restitution of money lost through acts of unfair competition, as defined in section 17200, whether or not the court also enjoins future violations."" ( ABC Internat. 
Traders, Inc. v. Matsushita Electric Corp. (1997) 14 Cal. 4th 1247, 1271, 931 P.2d 290.) "
1133,19," The PUC only requests that this court not preclude the practice of cellular bundling, a practice the PUC has found to be in the 
public interest. The issue of the propriety of bundling is not before this court and we express no opinion in that regard. "
1140,1," The City of McAlester and the McAlester Public Works Authority will be referred herein collectively since the parties do not 
specifically delineate the separate roles that these two Defendants played in the events forming the basis of this action."
1140,2," Although not relevant to this court's determination in this Order, the parties disagree as to whether Pitt-7 was provided the 
opportunity to ""participate"" in providing water service to the Park."
1140,3," See, Affidavit of Michael R. Spear, professional engineer, Exh. 21 to the Exhibits to Plaintiff's Response to McAlester's Motion 
for Partial Summary Judgment filed August 4, 1997; Transcript of Hearing on Motion by Plaintiff for Preliminary Injunction, Exh. A 
to Appendix of Exhibits to Defendants City of McAlester and McAlester Public Works Authority's Brief in Reply to Plaintiff's 
Response to Motion for Partial Summary Judgment filed September 2, 1997, p. 65, ll. 4-7. "
1141,4," This argument surrounding a violation of the Tenth Amendment was subsequently withdrawn by the City and thus will not be 
address further. "
1143,5," The City does challenge the contention that Pitt-7 possessed the legal right to provide service after the Board deannexed the 
Park. However, clearly, Pitt-7 did have the legal right under Oklahoma law and the Board's orders establishing its service 
territory to provide service to the Park prior to the deannexation."
1143,6," In light of this Court's finding on the merits of the Section 1926(b) claim, the arguments proffered by the City in relation to 
whether the deannexation of the Park removed it from Section 1926(b) protection and whether the tendering of all other 
customers within Pitt-7's territory except for the Park has any bearing upon Section 1926(b) protection are rendered moot and 
will not be addressed in this Order. "
1144,7," Pretrial Conference Order filed November 12, 1997 at pp. 3-4. "
1155,1," Even if, as a general matter, the Court were inclined to allow such state law claims, the state law statutory claim for unfair 
competition would have to be dismissed. Wis. Stat. § 100.20(1) provides generally that ""methods of competition in business and 
trade practices in business shall be fair. Unfair methods of competition in business and unfair trade practices in business are 
hereby prohibited."" However, the statute anticipates that enforcement efforts will be, in the first instance administrative. That is, 
the statute provides that the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (""DATCP"") may issue general and 
special orders forbidding or enjoining unfair methods of competition. Wis. Stat. §§ 100.20(2)&(3). Where such an order is issued, 
the statute further provides that ""any person suffering pecuniary loss because of a violation by any other person of any order 
issued under this section may sue for damages therefor in any court of competent jurisdiction…."" Wis. Stat. § 100.20(5). Thus, it 
is clear that the private right of action created by the statute has, as a condition precedent to bringing suit, the requirement of a 
prior administrative order for bidding or enjoining the conduct at issue. There is no such order in this case. Beatrice and 
Kustner's reliance upon Mercury Record Prods. v. Economic Consultants, Inc., 64 Wis. 2d 163, 218 N.W.2d 705 (Wis. 1979) 
for the proposition that no such order is necessary is misplaced. While that decision did imply that such an order is not 
necessary before bringing a common law claim for unfair competition, it carries no such implication for statutory claims. Beatrice and Kustner also raise federal common law claims of unfair competition. There is no federal common law claim of unfair 
competition, and thus any such claims cannot stand.  Water Technologies Corp. v. Calco, Ltd., 850 F.2d 660, 670 (Fed. Cir. 
1988). "
1161,1," CCO was named as a defendant in this action, but Direct Media settled its claims with CCD prior to the Court's consideration of 
this motion."
1161,2," Defendants contend that Screven was motivated to bring this lawsuit as a result of a memorandum he received in February 
1996 from the Association of Directory Publishers (""ADP""). The memorandum advised ADP members of the passage of the 
Telecommunications Act of 1996 and suggested that all independent publishers should send a letter to the local phone company 
requesting telephone listing information with a copy of the pertinent section of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The 
memorandum also advised that if the publisher is unhappy with the phone company's response, it may sue the phone company 
in a United States District Court to recover damages and attorneys' fees. "
1162,3," HN3[
] All alleged conspirators need not be defendants in an antitrust action.  Hennessey v. National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 564 F.2d 1136, 1147 (5th Cir. 1977). "
1164,4," Defendants foster the impression among the local advertisers that Plaintiff's directory is inferior. CCD uses the fact that Direct 
Media's directory may contain out of date information as a sales technique when soliciting advertisers. "
1165,5," This is not voluntary dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a) because Plaintiff has not made such a motion as 
required by the rule, nor have the parties stipulated to the dismissal in writing. See Negron v. City of Miami Beach, 113 F.3d 
1563, 1571 (11th Cir. 1997). HN11[
] A motion tor voluntary dismissal is generally granted unless there is evidence that the 
defendant will suffer specific prejudice.  Fisher v. Puerto Rico Marine Mgmt., 940 F.2d 1502, 1502 (11th Cir. 1991) "
1166,6," Plaintiff should have responded to this argument raised by Defendants. Under the Local Rules for the United States District 
Court of the Southern District of Georgia, ""Failure to reply shall indicate that there is no opposition to a motion."" Local Rule 7.5 
(1996). The Court could assume that Plaintiff's silence is consent to the dismissal. However, in the absence of a motion, the 
Court will not dismiss the Count. "
1174,1," In accordance with the agreement, the court will dismiss with prejudice Plaintiffs' remaining claims for relief and Defendants' 
remaining counterclaims not disposed of in this opinion. In addition, Sea-Roy stipulates that it cannot show injury to competition 
due to Rammax's allegedly discriminatory prices in favor of Multiquip. The court therefore will dismiss with prejudice Plaintiffs' 
Robinson-Patman Act claim against Rammax and Multiquip. "
1175,2," A trench compaction roller is a heavy piece of construction machinery. It is used to compact soil in confined areas in order to 
provide the soil with the ability to support added weight after the soil has been turned."
1175,3," Rammax manufactures a line of rollers which will be referred to in this opinion as ""RAMMAX."""
1175,4," Pursuant to the court's Memorandum Opinion and Order of August 15, 1995, all claims against Kracht and Farymann were 
dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction. "
1176,5," Additional facts relating to the trademark infringement claim and counterclaim will be set forth below in the relevant discussion 
section. "
1178,6," To make the exhibit references succinct, the court will refer to a particular exhibit (Plaintiffs' Exhibit, ""PX"" and Defendants' 
Exhibit, ""DX"") by reference to the filing to which it is attached. For example, the reference ""Pls.' Conspiracy Br. in Opp. to MQ 
and Rammax, Feb. 27, 1997, Tab 4, PX 444,"" refers to a document which may be found in the appendix to a memorandum 
entitled Brief of Plaintiffs in Opposition to Partial Summary Judgment Motion of Defendants Multiquip and Rammax for Summary 
Judgment Dismissing Sherman Act Claims for Lack of Any Conspiracy filed on February 27, 1997, at Tab 4 of the appendix 
marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 444."
1178,7," The provision allowed for varying terms of payment over the course of the ensuing six months in order for Rammax to realize 
savings of discount charges on letters of credit issued on behalf of Multiquip. Such discount charge set-offs were the only part of "
1179,," the agreement relating to Sea-Roy's debt. The parties specifically agreed that Multiquip did not assume responsibility for the 
debt. (Pls.' Conspiracy Br. in Opp. to MQ & Rammax, Feb. 27, 1997, Tab 23, PX 618.)"
1179,8," This relationship, for purposes of the § 1 claim, was narrowed by the court in its order of August 17, 1996, to encompass 
dealings relating to repair and replacement parts for RAMMAX rollers. The court found that Rammax's termination of Sea-Roy as 
a distributor for trench compaction rollers could not constitute a § 1 violation. "
1180,9," The court's conclusion that Rammax had legitimate, unilateral reasons for terminating Sea-Roy as a distributor relates only to 
the conspiracy element of § 1, not to the breach of contract claim discussed below. A manufacturer could have independent 
reasons for terminating a distributor, which would show a lack of concerted activity, but the same conduct could constitute a 
breach of contract if the terms of the contract prohibited the termination. "
1181,10," Chris and Mike Smith have testified in their depositions, however, that a representative from Farymann, Mr. Holzhuter, told 
them at a meeting in September 1993, that Holzhuter apologized for Farymann's decision to refuse to sell directly to Sea-Roy. 
Chris Smith stated that Holzhuter told him that Schuett had called Farymann in January 1992, to tell Farymann to stop selling 
directly to Sea-Roy. (C. Smith Dep. at 696.) According to the Smiths, Holzhuter thought that Farymann's actions were against 
the law. The fact remains, however, that Sea-Roy was not cut off from Farymann engine parts. As the evidence shows, 
Farymann merely decided to cure its chronic logistical problems by consolidating distribution into one entity, PRP. Not only did 
Sea-Roy still have access to Farymann parts through PRP (albeit at less of a discount), but Sea-Roy also secured alternative 
sources for the parts. (C. Smith Dep. at 690-91.)"
1181,11," Plaintiffs also claim that Multiquip and PRP conspired to obtain Farymann's agreement to stop supplying air-cooled diesel 
engines and associated parts to Entec West, a distributor of Farymann products located in Oregon. As Defendants point out, 
however, Entec West's contract with Rammax provided only for the distribution of ""marine diesel engines and all parts and 
components related thereto, manufactured by the Farymann GmbH."" (Defs.' Conspiracy Br., Dec. 9, 1996, Tab 32, DX 801.) Any 
request from Farymann that Entec West stop supplying spare parts for air-cooled engines would be in keeping with the original 
agreement and consistent with Farymann's clear right to make its system of distribution as efficient as possible. See Monsanto 
Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 763-64, 104 S. Ct. 1464, 1470, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1984). "
1182,12," Sunbelt had repeatedly complained to Multiquip and Sunbelt's parent company, Ashtead Group, PLC, that Smith sold 
Rammax products, and eventually Ameramax products, at a price below Sunbelt's cost from Multiquip. (Pls.' Conspiracy Br., 
Feb. 27, 1997, Tab 33, PX 409.) "
1183,13," See also Parkway Gallery Furniture, Inc. v. Kittinger/Pennsylvania House Group, Inc., 878 F.2d 801, 805 (4th Cir. 1989) 
(holding that ""'something more' than a bare complaint and a response to it is necessary to support an inference of a conspiracy 
in a nonprice restriction claim"")."
1183,14," Like Rammax Maschinenbau and its RAMMAX brand rollers, Ameramax marketed its roller with lettering consisting of all 
capital letters. "
1184,15," The fax from Kracht reads as follows: Dear Mr. Smith: Following up our conversation by phone on December 15, 92 we already informed you that we are not able to accept your order 
27410 dated November 27, 92 for items in question. Due to discussion with our main customer Rammax [sic] we have been informed that Sea-Roy Corporation is the former agent 
for Rammax [sic] in the USA. Furthermore we have heard that you are in direct competition to Rammax [sic] on this application. We would have appreciated if you had not withheld this information which we consider as very important. We regret very much to inform you that it is not possible [to bring this business to a conclusion. We know very well] that 
Rammax [sic] do [sic] not agree to this business, due to an existing gentlemen [sic] agreement which do [sic] not allow us to 
deliver the requested goods for the same application. (Pls.' Conspiracy Br. in Opp. to MQ & Rammax, Feb. 27, 1997, Tab 50, DX 187A, Ex. 7.) "
1185,16," Multiquip sued Chris Smith, Ameramax, and Sea-Roy for unfair trade practices in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-1.1. The 
complaint alleged that since the time Sea-Roy was terminated as a RAMMAX distributor on November 23, 1992, Ameramax had 
continued to hold itself out as a RAMMAX distributor. Among other allegations, Ameramax was passing off rollers as 
AMERAMAX products which actually contained RAMMAX parts. Multiquip voluntarily dismissed the action on October 21, 1993."
1185,17," Plaintiffs also claim that Multiquip, PRP, and Sunbelt engaged in a coordinated campaign to disseminate derogatory and 
untrue statements about Plaintiffs in an attempt to drive them out of business. Normally an antitrust plaintiff will include in its 
complaint a pendent state-based cause of action for defamation or commercial disparagement. Indeed, Plaintiffs have alleged in 
their ninth cause of action that Rammax, Multiquip, PRP, and Sunbelt published false and defamatory statements about 
Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs attempt to use these same facts to support a § 1 violation. Once again, Plaintiffs offer no legal support for 
these claims. The court, however, need not address their merits due to the finding below that, in any event, Plaintiffs fail to offer 
sufficient evidence of antitrust injury to survive Defendants' motions for summary judgment under § 1. "
1186,18," The market for trench compaction rollers was not a relevant market under the rule of reason analysis because reasonable 
substitutes existed for those products at the interbrand level. Citing Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 51-
57, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 2558-61, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977), this court found that without market power at the interbrand level, a 
manufacturer's refusal to deal with a distributor in the intrabrand market does not allow the manufacturer to set prices unaffected 
by competition. See Mem. Op. as to Mot. of Rammax, MQ, and PRP at 14 (Aug. 17, 1995)."
1186,19," Plaintiffs attempt to explain this statement by claiming that the affidavit was sworn to at a time when Sea-Roy could still 
purchase original Farymann parts and engines directly from PRP. As discussed below, the decision by PRP not to deal directly "
1187,," with Sea-Roy only foreclosed one channel of access to engine replacement parts. Plaintiffs, however, do not try to defend this 
affidavit statement as it relates to non-engine replacement parts."
1187,20," Thus, contrary to Plaintiffs' assertions, this is not a case like Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Serv., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 
112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992), where a single brand of a product (here, genuine RAMMAX parts or genuine 
Farymann parts) constitutes the relevant product market. See, e.g., Tarrant Serv. Agency, Inc. v. American Standard, Inc., 12 
F.3d 609, 615 (6th Cir. 1993) (where generic parts used in the servicing and repair of a manufacturer's product were ""reasonably 
interchangeable"" with genuine parts, the manufacturer's own genuine parts could not constitute the relevant product market)."
1187,21," In responding to a motion for summary judgment, ""the non-moving party must come forward with 'specific facts showing that 
there is a genuine issue for trial.'"" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 1356, 
89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)). The record taken as a whole must be sufficient to ""lead a rational trier of 
fact to find for the non-moving party."" Id. "
1188,22," In their opposition brief, Plaintiffs state that no ""functional substitutes"" existed for Kracht pumps and motors and genuine 
Farymann parts from the time Sea-Roy was terminated in November 1992, to the time Ameramax unveiled its competing roller in 
1993. (Pls.' Sherman Act Br. in Opp. to Rammax, MQ, PRP, and Sunbelt, Dec. 13, 1996, at 5.) ""Multiquip and PRP remained the 
only United States sources for Kracht pumps for use on Rammax rollers and Farymann engine [sic] and parts . . . ."" Id. This 
statement begs the question of whether Plaintiffs even attempted to source pumps or engine parts from foreign dealers. Without 
evidence of actual unavailability, the court cannot assume that no reasonable substitutes existed. "
1189,23," See 8 Phillip E. Areeda, Antitrust Law P 1653, at 583 (1989) (""Vertical non-price restraints are reasonable when there is no 
proof of adverse market effects."")"
1189,24," Plaintiffs' evidence of obvious anticompetitive effects may take the form of a rise in prices above the competitive level or a 
decrease in the supply of replacement parts.  Oksanen v. Page Mem'l Hosp., 945 F.2d 696, 709 (4th Cir. 1991). "
1190,25," Plaintiffs are also entitled to summary judgment on their claims for relief under North Carolina unfair competition laws pursuant 
to N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ 75-1 and 75-1.1 against Rammax, Multiquip, PRP, and Sunbelt. Plaintiffs' claims under § 75-1, which is 
based on § 1 of the Sherman Act, see Rose v. Vulcan Materials Co., 282 N.C. 643, 655, 194 S.E.2d 521, 530 (1973), will be 
dismissed for the same reasons Plaintiffs' § 1 claim will be dismissed as discussed above. Plaintiffs' claims under § 75-1.1, 
which forbids unfair methods of competition or unfair and deceptive trade practice, will be dismissed due to Plaintiffs' failure to 
establish (1) an adverse effect on competition, or (2) actual injury or damage to themselves as a result of the alleged unfair 
actions by Defendants. As Defendants point out, Plaintiffs' only ""evidence"" consists of speculative theories of recovery, not facts 
which would lead a reasonable finder of fact to conclude Defendants have engaged in unfair or deceptive trade practices."
1190,26," Plaintiffs also rely on Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Serv., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 
(1992), for the proposition that Multiquip and PRP stand in the shoes of Kodak because they are the sole source of genuine 
RAMMAX, Kracht, and Farymann replacement parts. In Kodak, the Supreme Court refused to enter summary judgment against 
an independent distributor's antitrust claim where the distributor argued that the manufacturer Kodak wrongfully limited the 
availability of replacement parts for Kodak equipment to distributors for the purpose of strengthening Kodak's position in the 
aftermarket for parts. Kodak is easily distinguishable from the case at bar. There, Kodak entered into express agreements with 
each of its OEM's whereby the OEM's were prohibited from selling parts to anyone other than Kodak. Kodak forced its 
competitors out of business in the aftermarket for replacement parts through such agreements. In this case, the only express 
agreement alleged by Plaintiffs is that between Rammax and Kracht relating to the triple stage pump. The court has found this 
agreement to be a lawful, procompetitive one, but, in any case, Defendants have offered unrebutted testimony that the triple 
stage pump is available from four other manufacturers. ( H. Schuett Decl. of Oct. 17, 1995 P 18.) "
1191,27," Rammax posits other reasons for seeking another distributor, including (1) Sea-Roy's concentration on unprofitable 
international business activities while business at home suffered; (2) Sea-Roy's excessive employee turnover; (3) Sea-Roy's 
declining sales; and (4) dissatisfaction among some of Sea-Roy's dealers. See Rammax's Resp. to First Interrog., June 3, 1996 
at 3."
1191,28," The Waldrep Bros. court made frequent reference to the at-will nature of the contracts between Waldrep and the 
manufacturers. Although Sea-Roy's distribution contract with Rammax was not strictly an at-will agreement (the language 
provided for cancellation only upon ""grounds that are sound""), the court does not find this factual distinction between the 
contracts in that case and the one at bar to be dispositive. This finding is supported by the fact that the only harm incurred by 
Plaintiffs was incidental to the competitive process. See Waldrep Bros. Beauty Supply v. Wynn Beauty Supply, 992 F.2d 59, 63 "
1192,," (4th Cir. 1993) (only harm Wynn intended to cause Waldrep was incidental harm to competitors that is necessarily part of all 
legitimate business competition). "
1193,29," Apparently recognizing what a slender reed its breach of contract claim rests upon, Sea-Roy has adopted a claim of 
constructive fraud in its response to Rammax and Multiquip's Motion for Summary Judgment. Nowhere in the Second Amended 
and Supplemental Complaint does an allegation of fraud appear, nor do Plaintiffs offer any evidence to support their newfound 
claim. The court will not consider Plaintiffs' untimely assertion."
1193,30," In the Second Amended and Supplemental Complaint, Plaintiffs allege trademark infringement as the eighth cause of action 
but combine the seventh (federal unfair competition) and eighth causes of action under their claims for relief. In their response to 
Rammax's Motion for Summary Judgment, however, Plaintiffs allege violations of the federal unfair competition statute, 15 
U.S.C. § 1125(a), and of ""the Federal Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1051-1127."" See Pls.' Trademark Infringement Br. in Opp. to 
Rammax & MQ, Nov. 25, 1996, at 7. Due to the agreement among the parties reducing the number of claims, and thereby 
eliminating the seventh cause of action, the court reads the complaint to state a claim for trademark infringement under 15 
U.S.C. § 1114(1). "
1194,31," Rammax presents uncontested evidence that as late as June 2, 1992, Sea-Roy knew of a competing Vermeer roller with a 
similar alphanumeric reference to drum widths (the ""TC23/33 Model"") but did not complain to Vermeer about its choice of model 
names. "
1195,32," Sea-Roy failed to disclose two highly relevant pieces of information known to Sea-Roy during the application process. First, 
Sea-Roy failed to mention that Rammax had been selling RAMMAX rollers with the P33/24 designation to Multiquip during 1992 
and 1993. Second, Sea-Roy was defending a state court suit brought by Multiquip to prevent Sea-Roy from using the P33/24 
mark."
1195,33," Defendants have not argued for a cancellation of the P33/24 trademark based on fraudulent application statements. The court 
notes in passing, however, that Rammax has filed a petition to cancel the P33/24 mark based on fraud in the procurement of 
registration. The PTO has suspended Rammax's motion pending final resolution of this case. The court will defer to the final 
action of the PTO on this issue. "
1196,34," Chris Smith does claim that the P33/24 designation makes reference to World War II fighter planes in an attempt to convey ""a 
feeling of toughness and power."" (C. Smith Aff. of Nov. 24, 1996, at P 11.) The evidence in the record, however, fails to support 
such an assertion. Plaintiffs never made reference to fighter planes in any filings to the PTO. This absence is glaring considering 
the difficult time Sea-Roy had in getting the certificate of registration for the P33/24 mark. There is no evidence that Sea-Roy 
ever marketed its rollers using fighter planes nor any evidence that customers ever associated the P33/24 mark with fighter 
planes. The court finds that the conclusory affidavit assertion is simply not enough to create a genuine issue of fact on the issue 
of descriptiveness. See Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587, 106 S. Ct. at 1356, (record taken as a whole must be sufficient to ""lead a 
rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party""). "
1197,35," Defendants have cited numerous cases which support the rule that a foreign manufacturer of goods is presumed to be the 
owner of the trademarks associated with those goods absent a contractual agreement to the contrary. See, e.g., CBS, Inc. v. 
Logical Games, 719 F.2d 1237 (4th Cir. 1983) (In the absence of contractual rights to trade dress in toy game with foreign-
manufacturer, non-exclusive domestic distributor of toy game did not attain exclusive rights by purchasing and redistributing 
3,000 games in the United States, and no claim existed for trade dress infringement against domestic toy manufacturer, which 
entered into exclusive distribution agreement with foreign manufacturer granting it exclusive rights in trade dress.); Energy Jet, 
Inc. v. Forex Corp., 589 F. Supp. 1110 (E.D. Mich. 1984) (finding that in the absence of an agreement, mere conception of or 
advertising of a trademark is not sufficient to acquire trademark rights where labelling of trademark done by manufacturer and 
goods not specifically manufactured for distributor); Hank Thorp, Inc. v. Minilite, Inc., 474 F. Supp. 228, 236 (D. Del. 1979) (in 
absence of express agreement, court looked to conduct of parties to determine whether British manufacturer had assigned 
trademark rights to exclusive domestic distributor; court concluded that trademark rights remained with foreign manufacturer); 
Global Maschinen GmbH v. Global Banking Sys., Inc., 227 U.S.P.Q. 862, 866 (T.T.A.B. 1985) (in petition seeking cancellation of 
trademark, registrant/terminated exclusive distributor failed to rebut presumption of foreign manufacturer's ownership of 
trademark with evidence of express or implied agreement); 4 McCarthy, § 29:8[15] (""Ownership of a trademark in the United "
1198,," States as between a foreign manufacturer and an exclusive United States distributor is largely a matter of agreement between 
them."") (citing cases)."
1198,36, See Footnote 33. 
1199,37," The court's disposition of this claim renders it premature to reach the merits of Rammax's counterclaims for fraudulent 
conveyance and piercing the corporate veil. Both of these claims are asserted with the hope of collecting the disputed debt owed 
to Rammax by Sea-Roy from as many parties as possible. Logically, it should first be determined whether a debt is still owed 
and, if so, how much is still owing before seeking to collect it. Accordingly, the court will deny Rammax's Motions for Summary 
Judgment on the Fraudulent Conveyance Counterclaim and on the veil-piercing counterclaim."
1199,38," The test for trademark infringement and unfair competition under the Lanham Act is the same. See Lone Star Steakhouse & 
Saloon, Inc. v. Alpha of Va., Inc., 43 F.3d 922, 930 (4th Cir. 1995)."
1199,39," The RAMMAX mark was registered by Rammax Maschinenbau on August 17, 1993 (Registration No. 1,787,857). Plaintiffs' 
counsel admitted at the preliminary injunction hearing on May 19, 1995, that they no longer had the right to use the RAMMAX 
trademark. This position is inconsistent with the stance taken by Plaintiffs in their brief that the RAMMAX trademark enjoys no 
protection. Moreover, following termination of the dual distributorship and notification by Rammax Maschinenbau to cease 
representing itself as a Rammax distributor, Plaintiffs ceased doing business under the name Rammax Machinery Co. However, 
as will be shown, even considering Plaintiffs' inconsistent positions, the RAMMAX mark is protectible."
1199,40," Thus Plaintiff has the twofold task of overcoming the presumption of non-genericness and establishing a genuine issue of fact 
as to genericness."
1199,41," Generic words in the trademark sense are names of products rather than brands, because they ""identify the general nature of 
an article."" Sara Lee Corp. v. Kayser-Roth Corp., 81 F.3d 455, 464 n.10 (4th Cir. 1996) (citation omitted). For example, ""car"" or 
""automobile"" are generic names for a product and may not be trademarked while ""Ford"" or ""Chevrolet"" are distinctive words for 
particular automobile brands and may be protected. See Blau Plumbing, Inc. v. S.O.S. Fix-It, Inc., 781 F.2d 604, 609 (7th Cir. 
1986). "
1202,42," Sea-Roy had formed Rammax Machinery Company as a North Carolina corporation on September 30, 1992, and made it the 
retail arm of Sea-Roy as part of a plan of reorganization. On the same day, Sea-Roy ""released its use of the DBA name 
'Rammax,' 'Rammax Machinery Co.' or any similar or derivative name to be utilized by Rammax."" (MQ and Rammax's 
Trademark Infringement Counterclaim Br., Oct. 28, 1996, Tab 44, DX 48.) "
1203,43," Section 1114(1) creates liability for ""any person who shall, without the consent of the registrant - (a) use in commerce any 
reproduction . . . of a registered mark . . . in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion . . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 
1114(1). See also S & R Corp. v. Jiffy Lube Int'l, Inc., 968 F.2d 371, 375 (3d Cir. 1992) (holding that concurrent use of a 
protectible trademark is likely to cause consumer confusion as to alleged infringer's affiliation with the mark holder); National Bd. 
of YWCA v. YWCA of Charleston, S.C., 335 F. Supp. 615, 628-29 (D.S.C. 1971) (use of ""YWCA"" mark by disassociated 
member of national organization is likely to cause confusion by ""impeding the plaintiff in controlling and directing the operations 
for which it is responsible and for which it will be called upon to explain in the Charleston area""). "
1205,44," See, e.g., Clinton Detergent Co. v. Procter & Gamble Co., 49 C.C.P.A. 1146, 302 F.2d 745 (C.C.P.A.) (""CARJO"" confusingly 
similar to trademark ""JOY""); Magnavox Co. v. Multivox Corp. of Am., 52 C.C.P.A. 1025, 341 F.2d 139 (C.C.P.A. 1965) 
(""MULTIVOX"" confusingly similar to ""MAGNAVOX""). "
1207,45," Plaintiffs suggest that when Baitsholts' testimony is ""fairly read"" it confirms that Plaintiffs were attempting to build off of the 
""max"" instead of the ""RAMMAX."" The court disagrees. Plaintiffs narrowly focus on the first part of Baitsholts' testimony quoted 
above where he gives his opinion as to what makes the AMERAMAX term effective in keeping the association alive with 
RAMMAX (the ""max""). In the second part of his testimony quoted above, Baitsholts specifically states that Chris Smith wanted to 
build off the name ""ramax,"" not merely the suffix ""max."" "
1208,46," While the issue of intent is relevant to other issues to be determined at trial, the awarding of damages and/or profits, the court 
will defer to the jury's assessment of the proper monetary relief to which Defendants are entitled."
1208,47," For example, Plaintiffs offer the affidavit testimony of Wendell E. Wood in which Wood relates the substance of a telephone 
conversation he overheard between Euliss and Tom Smart. Counterclaimants submit a fax from Mike Ferguson to Roger Euliss 
in which Ferguson mentions what a customer told him about confusion in the roller market. This evidence is not admissible 
under Rule 56(e); the court will, therefore, not consider it."
1208,48," Matthews also states in his deposition that he ""can't imagine"" that rental yard customers would be confused between a 
RAMMAX and an AMERAMAX roller. (Matthews Dep. at 76.) As the court has previously discussed, an affiant is competent to 
testify only as to facts known to him, he may not speculate about what other people thought. See Coca-Cola Co. v. Overland, 
Inc., 692 F.2d 1250, 1254-55 (9th Cir. 1982)."
1208,49," The next paragraph of Munson's affidavit states the following: ""My company has a rental fleet that rents Rammax brand 
machines, and it is logical that our promotional literature may mention Rammax products. The use of ""Rammax"" in our 
promotional materials does not indicate any confusion on the part of my company . . . ."" (Munson Aff. P 15.) This affidavit raises 
an interesting issue: neither party has offered evidence on the issue of likelihood of confusion among rental customers. The 
court would not logically exclude renters from the relevant consuming public. "
1209,50," The court notes several problems with Plaintiffs' affidavits. First, each affiant is only competent to testify about his confusion 
vel non by the source of the competing rollers. The court will not accept the affiants' conclusions about the trade as a whole as 
evidence on the issue of likelihood of confusion. Next, the affiants all state that they are in some manner related with the 
construction equipment industry but fail to state the specific capacity in which such association exists. As Chris Smith has 
testified, the roller market is composed of ""a very broad spectrum or cross-section of the construction equipment industry, 
contractors, dealers, [and] rental yards."" (C. Smith Dep. at 507.) Finally, each affiant merely concludes that, based on the price 
of the rollers ($ 18,000), the purchaser could not be mistaken. The affiants offer no other basis other than price to support their 
conclusions. Price is obviously a major factor but certainly not the only factor. For example, there is no assertion as to the detail 
of the decision making process behind a roller purchase or if an assessment is made of the company behind the roller. See 
Perini, 915 F.2d at 128 (quoting affidavit of a private construction administrator wherein affiant testified to the detail involved in 
awarding construction contracts). The court is unwilling to make assumptions about the complexity of these decisions. "

1218,1," Unless otherwise stated, all subsequent statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code."
1218,2," In the trial court, the County challenged the propriety of PG&E's use of a taxpayers' action as a method of challenging the 
County's power to bring its antitrust action in federal court, but the County does not do so here. We express no views on the 
propriety of using a taxpayers' action for this purpose. "
1219,3," The trial court's written ruling and the Court of Appeal's opinion do not address whether the County had the capacity to allege, 
in its federal lawsuit, its cause of action for unfair competition under the Unfair Practices Act (§ 17000 et seq.). Neither PG&E's 
petition for review nor the briefs of the parties in this court mention the matter. Accordingly, we do not consider the propriety of 
the County's cause of action for unfair competition."
1219,4," On January 16, 1996, shortly after we granted review of this matter, the federal district court dismissed the County's class 
action for reasons unrelated to the issues in this case. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld 
the dismissal. ( County of Stanislaus v. Pacific Gas and Elec. Co. (9th Cir. 1997) 114 F.3d 858.) Neither party has argued that 
the dismissal has rendered this case moot. Although PG&E's cause of action seeking injunctive relief appears moot, a live 
controversy may remain regarding its request for declaratory relief. (See Van Atta v. Scott (1980) 27 Cal. 3d 424, 449-450 [166 
Cal. Rptr. 149, 613 P.2d 210]; Stanson v. Mott (1976) 17 Cal. 3d 206, 223 [130 Cal. Rptr. 697, 551 P.2d 1].) Moreover, because 
PG&E's assertion that the County lacks the power to bring its antitrust action is an issue of substantial public interest that is likely 
to recur, we may reach the merits of the appeal even if the allegedly illegal action has been completed. ( John A. v. San 
Bernardino City Unified School Dist. (1982) 33 Cal. 3d 301, 307 [33 Cal. 3d 301, 187 Cal. Rptr. 472, 654 P.2d 242]; Cota v. 
County of Los Angeles (1980) 105 Cal. App. 3d 282, 289 [164 Cal. Rptr. 323].)"
1219,5," In part IV. below, we address PG&E's additional claim that the County also lacked the power to bring an action under federal 
antitrust law. "
1220,6," "" 'Parens patriae,' literally 'parent of the country,' refers traditionally to [the] role of [the] state as sovereign and guardian of 
persons under legal disability [P] . . . [P] State attorney generals [sic] have parens patriae authority to bring actions on behalf of 
state residents for anti-trust offenses and to recover on their behalf."" (Black's Law Dic. (6th ed. 1990) p. 1114, col. 1.) "
1224,7," For similar reasons, we reject PG&E's assertion that the Legislature's intent to deny counties the right to file suit on their own 
behalf is shown by its rejection in 1975 of Assembly Bill No. 1624, a bill proposing to increase the power of district attorneys to 
bring antitrust actions that was similar to the amendments to section 16750 that the Legislature later enacted in 1977. This 
proposed legislation concerned the power of district attorneys to bring antitrust actions, not the power of counties, cities, and 
other political subdivisions to file suit on their own behalf. "
1225,8," The dissent also cites D'Amico v. Board of Medical Examiners (1974) 11 Cal. 3d 1 [112 Cal. Rptr. 786, 520 P.2d 10], which 
explains that the state Attorney General has broad common law powers to file civil actions in proceedings involving the interests 
of the state. D'Amico says nothing, however, relevant to the issue in this case: whether the Attorney General has the exclusive 
power to bring an action under the Cartwright Act on behalf of a county. "

is a member of the organization. "
1236,2," AP indicates that it began printing the legend on its checks after the decision in Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 
490 U.S. 730, 104 L. Ed. 2d 811, 109 S. Ct. 2166 (1989). The plaintiffs assert that the reference in the legend to ""news materials 
described above"" is to ""a payment stub which does not describe the photographs submitted."" "
1237,3," Count Six asserts a nearly identical infringement claim on behalf of plaintiff Hurschmann, but as noted, AP has not made a 
motion as to that claim. Although AP speaks of moving to dismiss ""Counts One through Four, and part of Count Five,"" Count 
Five is not readily divisible. The Court therefore construes AP's motion to be directed at all of the first five counts of the 
Complaint and not at Count Six. "
1238,4," The plaintiffs do not -- and in any event could not -- dispute that HN3[
] it is appropriate to deny associational standing where 
the claims at issue require individual participation, even if the relief requested, as is often the case with declaratory or injunctive 
relief, does not so require. See Rent Stabilization Ass'n v. Dinkins, 5 F.3d 591, 596 (2d Cir. 1993) (""The relief requested is only 
half of the story. The Hunt test is not satisfied unless 'neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation 
of individual members in the lawsuit.'"") (quoting Hunt, 432 U.S. at 343) (emphasis in Dinkins). "
1239,5," The legend at issue read in pertinent part: By endorsement of this check, payee acknowledges payment in full for the assignment to Playboy Enterprises, Inc. of all 
right, title, and interest in and to the following items: [a description followed] Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Dumas, 831 F. Supp. 295, 300 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (alteration in original)."
1239,6," The district court repeatedly stressed this theme of clarity, concluding, for example, that the Ninth Circuit's view that ""a one-line 
pro forma statement will do"" to transfer copyright had to be ""predicated on the fact that the terms of the pro forma statement are 
clear,"" Playboy, 831 F. Supp. at 308 (citing Effects Assocs., Inc. v. Cohen, 908 F.2d 555 (9th Cir. 1990)), and that the import of 
two Southern District cases was that ""unless there is evidence of an intention to transfer copyright, a writing merely reciting 
transfer of an object will not transfer copyright,"" 831 F. Supp. at 309 (citing Kenbrooke Fabrics, Inc. v. Soho Fashions, Inc., 690 
F. Supp. 298 (S.D.N.Y. 1988), and Kenbrooke Fabrics, Inc. v. Soho Fashions, Inc., 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11588, 13 
U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) 1472 (S.D.N.Y. 1989)). "
1240,7," The Complaint explicitly states that two of the three individual plaintiffs were working as Freelance Photographers for AP when 
they took the photographs at issue, but does not make such an allegation as to plaintiff Tabacca."
1240,8," AP correctly notes that, because the provisions of New York's antitrust laws are to be construed in keeping with federal 
antitrust law, the plaintiffs' antitrust and unfair business claims under state law will rise or fall along with their federal antitrust 
claims. Because the Court concludes that the federal claims are deficient as a matter of law, the state claims will not be 
discussed. "
1241,9," The Barr court based this conclusion on the difference between Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15, which prohibits 
associations from suing for treble damages where the only injury alleged is to its members, see Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., 405 
U.S. 251, 262-65, 31 L. Ed. 2d 184, 92 S. Ct. 885 (1972), and Section 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 26, which permits ""any 
person, firm, corporation, or association . . . to sue for and have injunctive relief."" See Barr, 573 F. Supp. at 561-62."
1241,10," Unlike the declaratory judgment claim, for example, the claim here does not require proof that transfers of copyright were or 
were not effective in individual cases; rather, the claim seeks to bar the practice in the first instance on the ground that it 
restrains trade. Proving an adverse effect on competition in the marketplace as a result of that practice (regardless of its 
effectiveness to transfer copyright) would not necessarily require the participation of each individual photographer. "
1244,11," The plaintiffs' sole citation from this Circuit in support of their claim is to a single footnote in Itar-Tass Russian News Agency v. 
Russian Kurier, Inc., 886 F. Supp. 1120 (S.D.N.Y. 1995), which in turn cited a Fifth Circuit opinion in dicta for the proposition that 
receipt by the Copyright Office of a registration application (along with the required materials and fees) is sufficient to assert an 
infringement claim.  Id. at 1125 n.7 (citing Apple Barrel Prods., Inc. v. Beard, 730 F.2d 384, 386-87 (5th Cir. 1984)). Even aside 
from the limited persuasiveness in any event of so attenuated a reference, the Fifth Circuit opinion appears to offer minimal 
precedential value, especially today. First, it is evident that the court in Itar-Tass found the registration requirement unnecessary 
only because the works for which the plaintiffs sought copyright protection in that case were ""Berne Convention works under 17 
U.S.C. § 101,"" 886 F. Supp. at 1126, works that are expressly exempted from the registration prerequisite under Section 411 of 
the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 411. Moreover, as Judge Kaplan of this Court has pointed out, the statement in Apple Barrel 
regarding the necessity of actual registration was based solely on ""the then-current edition of Nimmer[,] . . . yet that authoritative 
text now quite clearly indicates that registration is a precondition to the commencement of an infringement action except in 
limited circumstances that do not pertain to this case."" Robinson v. The Princeton Review Inc., 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16932, 41 
U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) 1008, 1015 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (citing 2 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 7.16[B] 
(1996)). In short, the plaintiffs have offered no persuasive authority to sustain their claim. "
1265,1," ""A 'simple business customer' is a business which has inside wire that carries a single line or telephone number."" (Def. Br. at 5 
n.6.) Simple business customers are to be distinguished from 'complex business customers,"" a category which includes 
businesses with multiple telephone lines and which is not the subject of this lawsuit. Id. "
1267,2," Because a successful Rule 23(b)(3) showing by plaintiffs that common issues of law and fact predominate over individual 
questions necessarily implies that they have established the less stringent commonality requirement of Rule 23(a), the court will 
address the commonality arguments within the Rule 23(b)(3) predominance discussion.  Georgine v. Amchem Products, Inc., 83 
F.3d 610, 626 (3d Cir. 1996), aff'd sub nom.  Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 117 S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1997); In 
re Ford Motor Co. Ignition Switch Products Liab. Litig., 174 F.R.D. 332, 339 (D.N.J. 1997); Sollenbarger v. Mountain States Tel. 
& Tel. Co., 121 F.R.D. 417, 423 (D.N.M. 1988) (citing 7A Charles A. Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure § 1763, at 227 
(2d ed. 1986)). See also Herbert Newberg & Alba Conte, Newberg on Class Actions § 4.22 (3d ed. 1992)."
1267,3," The section of the New Jersey Antitrust Act at issue in this case was modeled after the Sherman Act, and New Jersey courts 
have looked to federal decisions interpreting the Sherman Act for guidance in interpreting the New Jersey statute.  Kugler v. 
Koscot Interplanetary, Inc., 120 N.J. Super. 216, 238, 293 A.2d 682 (Ch. Div. 1972). Therefore, this court will not distinguish 
between the two statutes for purposes of this motion for class certification. "
1272,4," Differential treatment of claims is permitted by Rule 23(c)(4), Fed. R. Civ. P., which states: When appropriate (A) an action may be brought or maintained as a class with respect to particular issues, or (B) a class 
may be divided into subclasses and each subclass treated as a class, and the provisions of this rule shall then be 
construed and applied accordingly. The theory of Rule 23(c)(4)(A) ""is that the advantages and economies of adjudicating issues that are common to the entire class 
on a representative basis should be secured even though other issues in the case may have to be litigated separately by each 
class member."" 7B Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure § 1790, at 271 (2d ed. 1986). Recently, courts have 
been cautioned against the class certification of common issues within a single claim by splitting the elements of a claim into 
class and individual components. See In re Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Inc., 51 F.3d 1293 (7th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom.  Grady v. 
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Inc., 516 U.S. 867, 133 L. Ed. 2d 122, 116 S. Ct. 184 (1995) (order for nationwide class certification of 
negligence issues relating to HIV contamination of defendant's products, leaving causation and damages to individual case 
determinations, was reversed); Castano v. American Tobacco Co., 84 F.3d 734 (5th Cir. 1996) (order for class certification of 
certain core tobacco liability issues on nationwide basis, to be followed by individual trials on comparative negligence and 
individualized harm, was reversed). The Supreme Court, subsequent to Rhone-Poulenc and Castano, continues to recognize 
that a class action may properly contain both common and uncommon issues so long as the uncommon questions are not 
significant compared with the magnitude and weight of the common issues.  Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 138 L. Ed. 2d 689, 
117 S. Ct. 2231, 2250 (1997), aff'g Georgine v. Amchem Prods., Inc., 83 F.3d 610 (3d Cir. 1996) (finding nationwide class 
certification inappropriate where disparities among circumstances of individual members undermines the common issues of fact 
concerning exposures to various asbestos-containing products). None of these cases suggests that class certification of all 
asserted causes of action is an all-or-nothing proposition. Moreover, a class certification which does not split the elements of a 
single cause of action into classwide and individual issues would not run afoul of Rhone-Poulenc or Castano. "
1273,5," In their brief, plaintiffs separately address the commonality and predominance requirements of Rule 23(a) and (b)(3). In 
addressing the commonality requirement, plaintiffs argue that commonality exists because each member of the putative class 
must demonstrate that BA violated the CFA and committed fraud. (Pl. Br. at 12.) This reasoning is clearly insufficient, for the fact 
that all putative class members seek to hold BA liable under the same legal theory does not establish commonality; plaintiffs 
must show that specific legal and factual arguments that will support liability are common to the class. The court will not deny 
class certification on this basis alone, however, for plaintiffs do address the commonality requirement with adequate specificity 
within their predominance discussion. "
1274,6," Plaintiffs actually cite four pieces of evidence, but one is a script for an oral solicitation that clearly has no bearing on the 
consistency of the misrepresentations in the written solicitations. (Pl. Br. at 29; Elkin Dec., Ex. 16.)"
1274,7," Plaintiffs again improperly cite materials related to oral solicitations as evidence that all written materials included the same 
misrepresentations. (Elkin Dec., Exs. 9, 10, 32.) "
1275,8," In their discussion of the written solicitations, plaintiffs did cite a script prepared by BA and employed by outside marketing 
vendors in support of this proposition. (Pl. Br. at 29 n.107.) This lone script falls short of establishing the requisite harmony 
among the many oral representations made for two reasons: (1) it does not seem to state or imply that inside wire failure is a 
serious danger, (Elkin Dec., Ex. 16); and (2) the same script was not employed by BA's own consultants who had the majority of 
contact with BA's customers, (Def. Br. at 20). "

the European Union in Brussels, which was conducting its own investigation of Microsoft in 1994. "
1284,7," HN4[
] A tying arrangement will generally be treated as per se unlawful, and thus prohibited without proof of an unreasonable anticompetitive effect, if: (1) two separate products or services are involved; (2) the sale or argument to sell one product or 
service is conditioned on the purchase of another; (3) the seller has sufficient economic power in the market for the tying product 
to enable it to restrain trade in the market for the tied product; and (4) a not insubstantial amount of interstate commerce in the 
tied product is affected. See Fortner Enters., 394 U.S. at 498-99. "
1285,8," It is not the Court's intention that OEMs be required to delete IE 3.0 from PCs on which it has already been installed. The Court

1295,1," For purposes of this motion, factual allegations in Castegneto's complaint are taken as true."

1296,5," Castegneto's assertion during the hearing that the tying product is not the employment contract per se, but rather, contractual 
relations between Castegneto and Boston Package is not convincing for two reasons. First, Castegneto describes the 
relationship between Castegneto and Boston Package as an employment contract more than once in its opposition to Boston 
Package's motion. Second, regardless of the name given the contract, its function and purpose was an exchange of services 
provided by Castegneto for money provided by Boston Package. "

1318,2," Taken in the aggregate, the following are sufficient to establish the defendants' prior planning and preparation of MIF. For 
example, Linda Horan testified that on the week of Daniel Lehner's death, Passarelli told her ""Inflight would continue, if not at the 
location we were at now."" Tr. 18. That same week, Passarelli asked Horan to ""get rid of his nondisclosure form from his 
personnel file."" Tr. 19. Horan was informed by Sergi and Passarelli, ""any kind of request that she [Remy Lehner] asks of me, that 
I should go through them."" Tr. 28. Sergi, Passarelli, and Newton would often meet outside the earshot of Remy Lehner. Tr. 28, 
29. Sergi asked Erwin Solares, two days after Lehner died, to make a videotape of the complete Inflight plant with a camera and 
tape provided by Sergi. Tr. 65, 69. Luis Rivera testified that approximately one week after Lehner's death, Sergi told Rivera ""that 
he will like for me to work with him no matter what he had to do."" prompting Rivera to reply ""I was going to stay with Inflight."" Tr. 
96. On the day Sergi resigned he informed Ephraem Seedansingh ""I'll certainly be in touch and whatever I do there will be a 
place for you."" Tr. 188. Remy Lehner testified that Passarelli told her approximately one week after Daniel Lehner's death that 
""he was going to hurt the business and he said that he had American Airlines"" Tr. 319. Remy further testified that Sergi, Newton 
and Passarelli would regularly meet without her and scatter if she walked into the room. Passarelli wouldn't allow Remy to write 
to customers unless she signed an employment contract. Tr. 322. Passarelli informed Remy that unless they were given 
employment contracts with significant raises, or allow them to buy a substantial piece of Inflight, they would take away the 
business. Tr. 324. During the interim they weren't returning phone calls or taking care of business. Tr. 325. Stephen Mason, Esq. 
testified that on June 26, 1997, he spoke with Mr. Kenneth Godt, Esq. who represented the defendants Passarelli, Newton and 
Sergi and was informed of three proposals: (1) the defendants would enter into long term employment contracts and be allowed 
to run the company; (2) the defendants would buy out Remy; (3) the defendants would leave and take 70% of the business. Tr. 
774, 842. Mr. Sergi, while still employed at Inflight met with Passarelli, Newton, Guido, and Antonelli and discussed the 
formation of a competing venture on July 14, 1997. Tr. 1022. Ms. Antonelli testified that she informed Mr. Passarelli, a few days 
after Mr. Lehner's wake that Remy indicated he would be fired. Tr. 1404, 1457. Passarelli informed Antonelli not to worry about 
the non-compete agreement, as he had spoken to an attorney about it. Tr. 1470. Antonelli told Jorge Martinez in the days prior 
to her resignation that she was leaving, and was going to take the Shuttles. Tr. 1568, 1569. She also stated that the name

1344,1," If CSU can establish an antitrust violation with respect to Xerox's refusal to license its copyrights, the same evidence likely will 
establish copyright misuse, which is CSU's primary defense to Xerox's copyright infringement counterclaim. See Mar. 21 Mem. & 
Order at 17-18 (citing Lasercomb, Am., Inc. v. Reynolds, 911 F.2d 970, 978 (4th Cir. 1990)). On the other hand, CSU's patent 
misuse defense is premised on Xerox's pricing of its patented products after April 1994, when Xerox started selling patented 
parts to CSU. We held previously that Xerox could price its patented parts as high as it sees fit. See Apr. 8 Mem. & Order at 24. 
Based on the Ninth Circuit's ruling in Kodak that a patent monopolist may charge a monopoly price for its products, CSU has not 
requested reconsideration of our previous ruling. "
1349,2," In Data General, the First Circuit expressed some doubt about the applicability of Aspen Skiing in the area of intellectual 
property but assumed for purposes of the opinion that the exclusionary withdrawal of assistance could overcome, in certain 
circumstances, the presumption that a refusal to license a copyright is not exclusionary. 36 F.3d at 1188."
1349,3," CSU argues that we should follow the First Circuit's rationale in Data General, and adopt only a rebuttable presumption that 
Xerox's refusal to license patented and copyrighted products is lawful. Even under the First Circuit's standard, however, we 
would find for Xerox as a matter of law because imposing liability in this case likely would frustrate the purposes of the Patent 
and Copyright Acts. See id. at 1187 n.64 (""we do not hold that an antitrust plaintiff can never rebut this presumption, for there 
may be rare cases in which imposing antitrust liability is unlikely to frustrate the objectives of the Copyright Act""). "
1350,4," Actually, it is unclear from the Kodak opinion exactly what documented reason would be sufficient to justify a refusal to deal. 
Accordingly, patent holders could rarely refuse to sell their patented products with any comfort that they are in compliance with 
the law. "
1373,1," Plaintiff concedes that consumers were not harmed by increased prices, but attempts to argue that Defendants' acts reduced 
output. Plaintiff's own allegations, however, demonstrate that output was not reduced in any way that caused an antitrust injury 
to consumers or competition. Plaintiff was initially the sole supplier of exhibition space at archery shows; Defendants' entry as 
competitors increased the exhibition space and options at archery shows. While it is true that following Plaintiff's withdrawal from 
the field the exhibition space at archery shows was reduced to its previous level, it is also clear that consumers were no worse 
off than they were before Defendants entered the archery show market, and were likely better off because of the competition, 
however short lived, created by Defendants. Plaintiff essentially complains that one monopolist was replaced by another, without 
alleging any harm to consumers or competition through reduced output or increased prices. "
1399,1," Arguably, Ginzburg may, if the Board decides to deny her application for reappointment, show that her removal from the 
medical staff at Memorial had an adverse affect on competition if she could also show that such decision negatively impacted 
her status at the ten other hospitals at which she currently has privileges, resulting in her exclusion from the profession as a 
whole. See Bolt v. Halifax Hosp. Med. Ctr. 891 F.2d 810, 820 (11th Cir. 1990) (stating that ""a negative decision by one hospital 
could be 'tantamount to excluding a doctor from the profession as a whole'"") (quoting Blumstein & Sloan, Antitrust and Hospital 
Peer Review, LAW & CONTEMP. PROBS., Spring 1988, at 9,15)). Competition may indeed be threatened as the number of 
competitors is unnaturally decreased. However, although the revocation of a doctor's privileges may reduce competition by 
decreasing the number of doctors in a certain specialty, this act alone will not give rise to an antitrust violation. Proof of 
concerted action is still required, which Ginzburg will be unable to produce with regard to the denial of her application for 
reappointment because that decision will be made by the Board unilaterally.  Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S.

1438,8," Also, 48 C.F.R. § 27.203 (1996) provides for the Contracting Officer to determine if and under what conditions the contractor 
shall indemnify the United States against liability for acts of patent infringement. Where the contract provides for such 
indemnification, the contractor would be poorly served by a rule prohibiting the sending of notices to government contractors. 
Moreover, a patentee cannot reasonably be expected to know if a particular infringing contractor will indemnify the government."
1438,9," The district court referred to VP's ""meetings with ASCOR and GDE Systems during which meetings [VP] allegedly threatened

These direct threats no more constitute patent misuse than do the threats of suit in the aforementioned infringement notices. "
1440,10," MAC also presented the testimony of (1) its president who stated that VP's warranty policies led MAC customers to express 
concern over using MAC components and (2) one customer who actually returned an ITA purchased from MAC as a result of 
VP's warranty policies. In light of our analysis of the principal evidence, we deem this anecdotal evidence to be insubstantial and 
insignificant. "
1441,11," Although the relevant product market was not expressly defined to include only products covered by the '005 patent, both 
parties emphasized that the findings of monopolization and attempted monopolization were premised exclusively on MAC's lost 
sales of receivers and ITAs adjudged to infringe the '005 patent. Accordingly, the '005 patent effectively defined the relevant 
product market for purposes of MAC's alleged antitrust injury. "
1452,1," The term ""Penn Grade crude oil"" as used in this lawsuit has both broad and narrow meanings. In its broad sense, the term is 
used in this case to refer to all crude oil produced from the western side of the Appalachian Basin in the states of New York, 
Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. Class counsel have thus broadly defined Penn Grade crude to include the following 
Appalachian crudes: (1) Quaker State: New York, Pennsylvania, Southwest Pennsylvania, Northern Pennsylvania, Bradford (Pennsylvania and 
New York), Allegheny, Middle District (Pennsylvania), Buckeye (Ohio), Zanesville (Ohio), Corning (Ohio), Eureka (West 
Virginia), Ohio, West Virginia and West Virginia Quaker State/ART; (2) Pennzoil: Middle District (Pennsylvania), Middle North (Pennsylvania), Southwest District (Pennsylvania), Bradford 
District (Pennsylvania and New York), Eureka (West Virginia), Buckeye (Ohio), East Canton (Ohio), Zanesville (Ohio), 
Corning (Ohio) and Western Pennsylvania Corning (Pennsylvania); and (3) Witco: Allegheny District (New York), Bradford District (Pennsylvania), Middle District (Pennsylvania), Southwest District 
(Pennsylvania), Buckeye (Ohio), Zanesville (Ohio) and Eureka (West Virginia). In its narrow sense, ""Penn Grade crude oil"" is the name given by Defendants to one of the three ""grades"" of crude oil produced 
in the Western Appalachian Basin (the other two ""grades"" being ""Eureka"" and ""Corning""). "
1453,2," The Court notes that Lazy Oil Co. and various other objectors to the proposed class settlement have taken the position that the 
Class is comprised of approximately 60,000 individuals. For the reasons discussed above, the Court does not adopt this 
estimate. Nevertheless, we note that, for reasons set forth in more detail below, the discrepancy in the parties' respective 
estimates of class membership does not in any way alter the Court's findings and conclusions relative to the appropriateness of 
the proposed class settlement."
1453,3," The Court held hearings on the merits of the Pennzoil/Witco Settlement Agreement, as well as the other outstanding motions, 
over a period of three days. Citations to the transcript from those hearings will be as follows: ""Tr. Vol. I"" will refer to the hearing "

1455,5," An ""oligopsony"" is a market situation in which there are only a few purchasers of a particular product and a large number of 
sellers. (See Expert Report of Lester B. Lave [Pennzoil Ex. D] at 13.) "
1457,6," The number of individuals filing ""Affidavits of Joinder"" is referred to as an ""approximation"" because there appear to be some 
duplications among those affidavits."
1457,7," Obviously, if the Class is comprised of approximately 60,000 individuals, as the Lazy Oil Objectors urge, then these objectors 
comprise an even smaller percentage of the Class. "
1459,8," Mr. Henderson explained that a ""producing horizon ""or ""zone"" is ""a zone of a given geologic age and these zones are identified 
and the depths might vary for a given geologic zone from county to county or certainly from state to state."" (Tr., Vol. I at 79-80.) 
Mr. Henderson opined that there are four or five horizons or zones within the Appalachian Basin, each of which (as noted 
previously) varies in terms of drilling depth, either from county to county, or at least from state to state. (Tr., Vol. I at 79-80, 94.) 
Thus, as the Court understands Mr. Henderson's testimony, it would be necessary to construct a hypothetical ""typical"" well for 
each area of similar drilling depth within a particular horizon. It is not clear from Mr. Henderson's testimony (and perhaps as yet 
undetermined by him) exactly how many ""typical"" wells would need to be evaluated."
1459,9," It should be noted that Lazy Oil never drilled a new well during the period 1981-95, despite periodic increases in the price of oil. 
(Tr., Vol. II at 98.) "
1461,10," In their consolidated brief filed post-hearing, the Lazy Oil Objectors make much of Dr. House's statement at deposition that he 
believed some additional production would have resulted if posted prices during the conspiracy period had been higher by $ 1.50 
per barrel on average. (See Consolidated Be. Of Lazy Oil Objectors at 11, 15; Lazy Oil Ex. 4-C at 665.) Nothing in this testimony 
convinces the Court that a lost profits damage model is preferable, much less required, in the context of this case. Indeed, we 
find the purported significance of Dr. House's remark to be somewhat overstated. Dr. House testified that, in general, he 
expected there would be ""slightly more production"" if the posted price was higher. (Lazy Oil Ex. 4-C at 665.) Of course, Dr. 
House's damage analysis did not include a lost profits measurement. Therefore, Dr. House was unable to quantify the additional 
production. Similarly, Dr. House did not determine at what price level new wells would be drilled. (Id. at 666.) Dr. House also 
testified that he did not study nor did he have an opinion on how supply would come into the market with an increase in price. 
(Id. at 667.) "
1462,11," The Court, of course, does not express any opinion as to the ultimate merits of the Plaintiffs' experts' theories."
1462,12," The NYMEX (""New York Mercantile Exchange"") price is a futures price that represents the price that will be paid by a 
purchaser for West Texas Intermediate crude delivered at Cushing, Oklahoma. (See Tr., Vol. III at 115.) "
1464,13," The New York Objectors also argue in their memorandum [Doc. No. 201] that the notice of settlement was deficient because: 
(1) it does not disclose the potential damages that would be recoverable (or the statutory right to an award of attorneys' fees) if 
the Class should prevail at trial; (2) it fails to advise class members of their potential individual recovery under the proposed 
Settlement; and (3) it does not reflect the fact that three named representatives oppose the Settlement. Inasmuch as most of 
these alleged deficiencies mirror the complaints raised by the Lazy Oil Objectors, we need not rehash this issue. Suffice to say 
that the Court is not persuaded by this line of argument. We find that none of the alleged deficiencies in the notice rise to such a 
level as to compromise the fundamental fairness of the Settlement or require this Court's disapproval of it. "
1465,14," Defendants' first motion for summary judgment was denied in July 1995 without prejudice to be refiled following a period of 
additional discovery."
1465,15," In fact, there were periods of time during the life of the alleged conspiracy when Defendants' posted prices were significantly 
different. (Witco Ex. B [Doc. No. 227], Tabs 2, 3, and 4; Pennzoil Ex. G-1 at 342-44.) "
1470,16," This assertion is apparently based on a document produced during discovery and identified as ""PC 306931."" This document 
states that ""Illinois Basin crude is an alternate crude for the Rouseville refinery. The Illinois Basin crude assay is basically the 
same as the Eureka."" (See Notice of Filing by Class Counsel of Pennzoil Document PC 306931 [Doc. No. 261].) "
1472,17," One of the Objectors' witnesses, William Henderson, testified that prices would have to remain at higher levels for at least a 
year or more before producers would be able to afford to drill new wells or refurbish old ones. (Tr., Vol. II at 26-27.) "
1473,18," Although Bennie Landers testified that he disagreed with Dr. House's estimate of the ""conspiratorial underpayment,"" (Tr., Vol. 
II at 50, 115), he was unable to offer any estimate of his own regarding the extent of the ""underpayment"" resulting from the 
alleged conspiracy. (Tr., Vol II at 80-81.)"
1473,19," Class Counsel's economic expert, Dr. Kevin Neels, testified that, even under extremely conservative assumptions regarding 
the quantities of additional crude oil that the ""lost profits"" theory presupposes, prices would have actually fallen if additional oil 
were introduced into a market situation where Defendants' refineries were operating at economically full rates. (Tr., Vol. II at 236-
39.)"
1473,20," While Bennie Landers testified that his ""lifting costs"" were approximately $ 17 per barrel (Tr., Vol. II at 41), another class 
member, William Henderson, testified that his lifting costs were approximately $ 21 per barrel (Tr., Vol. II at 12). "
1474,21," This estimate was the result, in part, of ""backcasting"" a percentage underpayment Dr. House computed for a sample period 
(1993-1995) to make it applicable to earlier years in the period. We have previously noted that Defendants' experts challenged 
Dr. House's use of backcasting in the circumstances of this case. Without backcasting, Dr. House's damages estimate for the 
two-year sample period was $ 23 million."
1474,22," As noted above, the period of damages under the statute of limitations without any extension thereof extends back to April 
1990. Therefore, the damages are slightly lower than $ 74 million for this period, or approximately $ 70 million. With damages 
during the statute of limitations period estimated at $ 70 million, the Settlement represents 20.7% of damages. Similarly, 
combining the Quaker State Settlement, the percentage is 27%."
1474,23," Our review of the Revised Exhibits 5, 5a and 11 to the Rebuttal Report of Dr. Neels (filed under seal) suggests that this figure 
was subsequently amended to $ 24-28 million."
1474,24," It also bears noting that, notwithstanding Mr. Landers's criticism of the Settlement amount and the methodology used to 
compute damages, Mr. Landers admitted during the testimony that he was incapable of determining what was a fair market price 
for Penn Grade crude. (Tr., Vol. II at 81.) "
1476,25," Expenses through late March, 1997 totaled approximately $ 426,228. By way of supplemental affidavits, Class Counsel have 
requested additional expenses for the period post-dating March 31, 1997 in the amount of approximately $ 59,937. "
1479,26," Mr. Landers estimated that he has spent approximately 10 hours per week on this case, or 520 hours per year, for each of the 
years 1994, 1995 and 1996. Similarly, for the 17 week period of January 1 through April 26, 1997, he estimates a total of 170 
hours spent on the case. Totaling these hours (i.e. 1730 hours for the period January 1994 through April 1997) and multiplying 
his estimated fee of $ 50 per hour, this yields a total of $ 86,500. In addition, Mr. Landers seeks payment in the amount of $ 
36,450 for approximately 729 hours spent on the telephone during 1994, 1995 and 1997 communicating with others about the 
case (again, at a fee of $ 50 per hour). Finally, Mr. Landers seeks payment in the amount of $ 12,932 for services and expenses 
incurred during 1996 in connection with the case. "
1485,27," While not determinative of the Court's conclusion that this settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate, the Court notes that it 
has reviewed the Affidavit of Arlin M. Adams concerning the fairness of the Settlement. Judge Adams believes that ""the 
judgment of counsel should be respected."" Adams Affidavit, P79. "
1486,28," The Court recognizes that, in GM Trucks Litig., the Third Circuit advised that silence from class members may not necessarily 
demonstrate tacit consent or support for the proposed settlement. 55 F.3d at 812-13. Indeed, the court in GM Trucks Litig. found 
that, under the circumstances of that case, the reaction of class members was negative on the whole and weighed against 
approval of the class settlement. Id. The court noted, among other things, that the absent class members suing GM might have 
been discouraged from voicing any objection to the settlement due to a small financial stake in the litigation or a lack of 
appreciation of the size of their claims. Notably, the class in GM Trucks did not include individuals who had already experienced 
problems or mishaps related to the allegedly defective fuel tank design; therefore, the court reasoned, the class might include 
members who would have no reason (outside of media coverage) to know of the latent defect or the claim based on the alleged 
existence of the defect. The court also apparently found it significant that the notice of class action had been sent simultaneously 
with the notice of class settlement, thus possibly casting the appearance that the settlement was a 'fait accompli.' And 
specifically, the court observed that the class notices lacked information concerning certain relief (i.e. a retrofit) that had been 
sought in the original complaint, and was in other respects arguably deficient. Additionally, the court found it instructive that 
many of the better informed absentee members did object, including fleet owners, some of whom owned as many as 1,000 
trucks. A poll conducted by the Plaintiffs' marketing expert further evidenced a lack of support, inasmuch as it showed that some 
63% of those members polled indicated that they would probably not or definitely not use the coupons which were part of the 
settlement to purchase a new GM truck. This, the court found, ""also suggests that the class could not possibly have so 
wholeheartedly endorsed the settlement."" 55 F.3d at 813. The court found that, despite the relatively low number of objectors in 
terms of absolute numbers, those objectors included fleet owners with a substantial financial incentive in the litigation, most of 
whom objected quite vociferously. Based on these circumstances, the court found that the reaction of the class was actually 
negative. While we are mindful of the Third Circuit's admonition against construing ""silent consent"" too strongly, we note that many of the 
concerns present in the GM Trucks Litig. case are not present here. Most of the class members who have filed objections in this 
litigation are not significant producers in terms of quantity oil produced or sales generated. Indeed, Plaintiffs have presented 
evidence that some of the more sophisticated and/or prominent producers (who presumably have a larger financial stake in this 
litigation) support the Settlement. Moreover, to the extent that the objectors point to alleged deficiencies in the class notice of 
settlement, we have found those deficiencies to be on the whole insubstantial and not likely to have significantly altered the 
Class's reaction. Also significant is the fact that here, unlike in GM Trucks, the notice of class action and notice of class 
settlement were not sent years apart. The settlement notice clearly advised members of their right to object and the manner in 
which they could go about registering their objections. The notice also clearly did not purport to the a complete summary of the 
litigation and referred class members to sources of additional information. In sum, we find the circumstances here to be 
sufficiently distinguishable from those in GM Trucks such that this Court is confident in concluding that the class reaction in this 
case favors approving the Settlement. However, even if we were to conclude that the Class's reaction to Settlement was 
essentially negative, we would still be inclined to find that the Girsh factors, on the whole, favor approval of the Settlement."
1486,29," The passages from In Re General Motors Corp. Engine Interchange Litig., 594 F.2d 1106 (7th Cir. 1979), cert. denied sub 
nom. Oswald v. General Motors Corp., 444 U.S. 870, 62 L. Ed. 2d 95, 100 S. Ct. 146 (1979), and cert. denied sub nom. General

inapposite. Those passages at 594 F.2d at 1139-40 relate to the ability of the Defendant to settle individually with class 
members. Further, Class Counsel here were authorized under Pretrial Order No. 1 to conduct settlement negotiations. "
1488,30," Unlike Plaintiffs' damage model, which was prepared by experienced economists and tested by days of discovery and 
deposition by Defendants' counsel, it appears that the Objectors' illustrative model was prepared without expert assistance and it 
is unclear what data formed the basis for the applicable assumptions. (See Objectors Memorandum [Doc. No. 180] at page 8 
where the Objectors admit that their model must be ""subjected to evidentiary scrutiny."") "
1496,31," The Affidavit of Howard J. Sedran, dated April 9, 1997, reflects a credit to the Settlement Fund in the amount of $ 39,698.46 to 
account for the Quaker State Settlement expenses."
1496,32," The Court's fee award of $ 5,341,000 and expenses in the amount of $ 486,165.00 represents approximately 30.5% of the 
total settlement, including interest (and not including the $ 250,000 to be set aside for settlement administration). Taking into 
consideration the Court's previous interim award of expenses, this total represents approximately 40% percent of the $ 18.9 
million Settlement Fund, plus interest. Many courts have awarded aggregated fees and expenses representing a similar 
percentage of a common fund in complex cases like this one. Erie Forge and Steel, Inc. v. Cyprus Minerals Co., et al., Civil 
Action No. 94-404 (W.D. Pa. 1996) (aggregate fees and expenses represented at least 45.8% of settlement fund.). See In re

1506,1," Plaintiffs' dissatisfaction with the LASB selection process has a long history. Ehlinger complained to the governor's office that 
E&A had been ""blackballed"" by the LASB in 1985 and again in 1991. AIA Mem., Exh. 29, Dep. of Mr. Ehlinger at 444, id. at 469. 
Plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in 1984 over the award of a project. Id. at 280-81. As early as 1984, Ehlinger complained to the Justice 
Department about the matters at issue in this lawsuit, specifically accusing the AIA and the LAA of violating the antitrust laws by 
boycotting him through control of the LASB. Id., dep. Exhs. 18, 23. "
1507,2," Although the Court disposes of all of the antitrust claims on other grounds, the Court notes that plaintiffs' tie-in claim is defective 
as a matter of law. HN1[
] A tying arrangement is ""an agreement by a party to sell one product [the tying product] but only on 
the condition that the buyer also purchases a different (or tied) product, or at least agrees that he will not purchase that product 
from any other supplier."" Northern Pac. Ry. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5-6, 78 S. Ct. 514, 518, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958). Here, 
the architects who were allegedly forced to buy insurance from the LAA and its executive director did not do so as a condition of 
being able to purchase another product. Further, the defendants are not alleged to be sellers of the tying product, which is the 
award of state architectural work. Moreover, there is no allegation that the alleged restraint had an anticompetitive effect on the 
insurance (tied) product market, a prerequisite in the Fifth Circuit to an illegal tie-in. See, e.g., Crossland v. Canteen Corp., 711 
F.2d 714, 722 (5th Cir. 1983). "
1510,3," Under Louisiana law, the Division of Administration has broad authority over the administrative functions of the State and. its 
agencies. See La. R.S. 39:1, 4. "
1512,4," Omni left open the possibility that state action immunity and Noerr-Pennington protection might not apply when the state acts 
as a commercial participant.  Omni, 499 U.S. at 374-75, 379, 111 S. Ct. at 1351. However, the Fifth Circuit has rejected a 
commercial participant exception to Noerr-Pennington immunity. See Greenwood Util. Comm'n v. Mississippi Power Co., 751 
F.2d 1484 (5th Cir. 1985). The court reasoned that administering a commercial exception to Noerr immunity would be difficult if 
not impossible when the government engages in a policy decision and at the same time acts as a participant in the marketplace.  
Id at 1498-1500. The Fifth Circuit has also rejected a commercial participant exception to the state action doctrine. See also 
Limeco, Inc. v. Division of Lime, 778 F.2d 1086, 1087 (5th Cir. 1985) (no commercial participant exception to Parker doctrine). 
These precedents continue to bind this Court. "
1515,5," Plaintiffs rely on a 1990 Consent Decrees between the AIA and the Justice Department settling an antitrust suit that challenged 
the AIA's policies regarding price competition. The decree enjoined the AIA and its components from adopting any course of 
action that discouraged price competition by architects. "
1517,6," Because the defamation claim is disposed of on its merits, the Court pretermits the question of prescription. "
1518,*," Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except 
under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4. "
1525,1," The Amended Complaint simply adds an additional count, and does not purport to contain all of the averments set forth in the 
original Complaint. Accordingly, I will treat it as a supplement to, rather than replacement of, the Complaint."
1525,2," Defendants do not, however, seek the dismissal of claims asserted in Counts 2, 3, 4, 6 or 13. "
1526,3," I acknowledge that Defendants state, in a conclusory footnote, and without any substantive analysis whatsoever, that Hughes 
is not the most efficient enforcer of the laws. See Docket No. 8, p. 5-6, n. 5 & 6. Resolution of this issue requires consideration of 
a variety of factors enumerated by the Supreme Court. See Associated General Contractors Inc. v. California State Council of 
Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 537-45, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 103 S. Ct. 897 (1983). I will not conduct an independent analysis of 
whether Hughes satisfies this test, when Defendants have treated this issue in a summary fashion. "
1529,4," Hughes cites to paragraphs 25-31 of the Complaint in support of his Contentions that he actually worked according to the 
conditions and benefits to which the parties initially agreed. Paragraphs 25 - 31 do not, however, contain any such suggestions."
1529,5," Given this dismissal, I need not address the Defendants' contentions pertaining to the Motion for a More Definite Statement. "
1530,6," Neither party addresses the impact, if any, upon Count Eight, of my dismissal of the antitrust claim asserted in Count One, for 
lack of standing. "
1531,7," The Shaid court did, however, state that, in the alternative, should the Pennsylvania Supreme Court recognize such a claim, it 
certainly would not do so where the only injury consists of economic damages. "
1536,1," To avoid confusion, ""Martin Marietta"" includes its predecessors in interest."
1536,2," Colsa, however, contends that prior to October 1993, Martin Marietta knew that it would not reteam with Colsa and sought to 
reteam with a competitor--Tower Systems. Colsa claims that Martin Marietta secretly concealed this intention in order to string 
Colsa along until it was too late for it to re-team with another competitor for the rebid process. As a result, Colsa argues that it 
had to forgo discussions about reteaming with ITT or Loral between September and December 1993, as it was waiting to hear 
from Martin Marietta. Martin Marietta claims that it terminated the subcontract with Colsa because it teamed with Raytheon in 
February 1994, thereby making it a competitive threat."
1536,3," Neither party, nor the court below, addresses the issue of whether Martin Marietta has market power. Instead, they focus on 
the definition of ""relevant market,"" which can affect whether a party has market power. Colsa contended that the relevant market 
in this case is the Contract alone. On the other hand, Martin Marietta argued that the relevant market extended far beyond the 
one Contract at issue here, and included other operation and maintenance contracts performed elsewhere. The district court 
found that Colsa failed to define adequately the relevant market which, in turn, apparently prevented a finding that Martin 
Marietta had sufficient market power to sustain an antitrust claim."
1536,4," As a preliminary matter, we disagree with Colsa's contention that merely because the definition of ""relevant market"" is a factual 
question, summary judgment is inappropriate. HN1[
] Summary judgment is clearly available even for factual issues. See American Key Corp. v. Cole Nat'l Corp., 762 F.2d 1569, 1579 (11th Cir.1985). Further, the fact that two witnesses provided 
testimony, in favor of Colsa, regarding the relevant market cannot preclude summary judgment. Colsa states that its witnesses "
1537,," were experts in government procurement, not federal antitrust law. The issue in this case, however, is the definition of ""relevant 
market""--an antitrust term as defined by antitrust law. Therefore, the witnesses could offer nothing more than lay opinion 
testimony. We have stated that ""HN2[
] construction of a relevant economic market or a showing of monopoly power in that 
market cannot … be based upon lay opinion testimony."" Id."
1537,5," ""HN4[
] This court may affirm the district court where the judgment entered is correct on any legal ground regardless of the 
grounds addressed, adopted or rejected by the district court."" Bonanni Ship Supply, Inc. v. United States, 959 F.2d 1558, 
1561 (11th Cir.1992) (citing cases)."
1537,6," This is presumably the result of the fact that neither Colsa nor Martin Marietta was awarded the Contract during the subsequent 
procurement, thereby making the claim that Martin Marietta had sufficient market power to monopolize the procurement process 
difficult to maintain."
1537,7," As a result, the cases cited by Colsa in support of its argument are inapplicable for several reasons. First, the cases are not 
controlling authority. Second, two of the cases cited involve claims of anticompetitive conduct during the procurement process. 
See National Reporting Co. v. Alderson Reporting Co., 763 F.2d 1020 (8th Cir.1985); F. Buddie Contracting, Inc. v. Seawright, 
595 F. Supp. 422 (N.D.Ohio 1984). Colsa does not make such a claim in this case. The fact that because those cases involved 
public contracts does not make them necessarily relevant. Third, the other case cited by Colsa involved a joint venture contract--
as opposed to a subcontract--whereby each party was awarded the government contract, albeit through a joint entity. See Tower 
Air, Inc. v. Federal Express Corp., 956 F. Supp. 270 (E.D.N.Y.1996). This case is completely different. Martin Marietta alone--
and not a single entity comprised of Colsa and Martin Marietta--was awarded the contract. The fact that the subcontract was 
labeled a ""Teaming Agreement"" did not create a joint venture relationship giving each party some right to the public contract."
1537,8," In fact, this case seems to involve nothing more than a breach of contract claim. The alleged improper conduct is the 
termination of a subcontract. Further, the injury alleged by Colsa is damage ""to its business interests in the amount of $ 
1,485,189 which represents the amount remaining to be paid under its current fixed price contract and the amount negotiated 
under the remaining option."" The remedy sought appears to involve purely contract damages. "
1546,1," Because this appeal stems from the grant of a motion for summary judgment, we review the facts taken in the light most 
favorable to the NCAA, the non-moving party. See Kaul v. Stephan, 83 F.3d 1208, 1212 (10th Cir. 1996). "
1547,2," Bylaw 11.6.4 provided in pertinent part: Number Limits. There shall be a limit on the number of coaches that may be employed by an institution in each sport (other 
than football) as follows: Sport: Basketball, Men; Head or Assistant Coach: 3; Restricted-Earnings Coach: 1."
1547,3," The proposed rule included a ""grandfather clause"" exempting schools from the staffing limitations where academic tenure, 
enforceable written contracts, or formal security-of-employment commitments would make it impossible to comply with such 
limits."
1547,4," Bylaw 11.02.3 provided: Restricted-Earnings Coach. A restricted-earnings coach is any coach who is designated by the institution's athletics 
department to perform coaching duties and who serves in that capacity on a volunteer or paid basis with the following 
limitations on earnings derived from the member institution: (a) During the academic year, a restricted-earnings coach may receive compensation or remuneration from the institution's 
athletics department that is not in excess of either $ 12,000 or the actual cost of educational expenses incurred as a 
graduate student. (b) During the summer, a restricted-earnings coach may receive compensation or remuneration (total remuneration shall 
not exceed $ 4,000) from: (1) The institution's athletics department or any organization funded in whole or in part by the athletics department or 
that is involved primarily in the promotion of the institution's athletics program (e.g., booster club, athletics foundation 
association); (2) The institution's camp or clinic, (3) Camps or clinics owned or operated by institutional employees, or (4) Another member institution's summer camp. (c) During the summer or the academic year, the restricted-earnings coach may receive compensation for performing duties 
for another department or office of the institution, provided: (1) The compensation received for those duties outside the athletic department is commensurate with that received by 
others performing those same or similar assignments, (2) The ratio of compensation received for coaching duties and any other duties is directly proportionate to the amount 
of time devoted to the two areas of assignment, and (3) The individual is qualified for and is performing the duties outside the athletic department for which the individual is 
compensated. "
1548,," (d) Compensation for employment from a source outside the institution during the academic year or from sources other 
than those specified under 11.02.3-(b) and 11.02.3-(c) above during the summer shall be excluded from the individual's 
limit on remuneration."
1548,5," Other cost-saving measures were adopted that, inter alia, limited:"
1548,*, the number of coaches who could recruit off campus.
1548,*, off-campus contacts with prospective student-athletes.
1548,*, visits by prospective student-athletes.
1548,*, printed recruiting materials.
1548,*, the number of practices before the first scheduled game.
1548,*, the number of games and duration of seasons.
1548,*, team travel and training table meals.
1548,*, financial aid grants to student-athletes. 
1549,6," HN1[
]  28 U.S.C. § 1337 provides in relevant part: (a) The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action or proceeding arising under any Act of Congress 
regulating commerce or protecting trade and commerce against restraints and monopolies."
1549,7," HN2[
]  15 U.S.C. § 15 provides in relevant part: (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section [regarding foreign states], any person who shall be injured in his 
business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the United 
States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without respect to the amount in 
controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable 
attorney's fee. HN3[
]  15 U.S.C. § 26 provides in relevant part: Any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of the United 
States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws."
1549,8," The relevant part of HN5[
]  28 U.S.C. § 1292(a) provides: The courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from: (1) Interlocutory orders of the district courts . . . granting . . . injunctions. "
1550,9," The NCAA does not challenge other portions of the order, such as the finding that a remedy at law would be insufficient. "
1552,10," In several instances, the NCAA tries to style itself as a joint venture, arguing that joint ventures are entitled to more favorable 
treatment under the antitrust laws. However, the Supreme Court rejected categorizing the NCAA as a joint venture with respect 
to the television rights plan challenged in Board of Regents because the plan did not ""eliminate individual sales of broadcasts, 
since these still occur, albeit subject to fixed prices and output limitations."" 468 U.S. at 113. Here, the NCAA does not hire 
coaches for the teams. Rather the teams hire coaches individually, ""albeit subject to fixed prices."" Thus, the NCAA does not 
operate as a joint venture for the purposes of hiring assistant basketball coaches. As a result, we do not consider the question of 
how joint ventures should be treated under the antitrust laws."
1552,11," Albeit often an abbreviated rule of reason analysis, as discussed below. "
1553,12," According to the NCAA, the relevant market would include, in addition to coaching positions in Division I schools, coaching 
positions in Division II and III schools, junior colleges, high schools, and professional teams. "
1554,13," Indeed, plaintiffs do not challenge the restrictions on the number of coaches included in the NCAA's bylaws. "
1555,14," Similarly, the NCAA cannot be heard to argue that the REC Rule fosters the amateurism that serves as the hallmark of NCAA 
competition. While courts should afford the NCAA plenty of room under the antitrust laws to preserve the amateur character of 
intercollegiate athletics, see Banks, 977 F.2d at 1089-93, courts have only legitimized rules designed to ensure the amateur 
status of student athletes, not coaches. "
1557,15," For example, some more-experienced coaches may take restricted- earnings coach positions with programs such as those at 
Duke or North Carolina, despite the lower salary, because of the national prominence of those programs. In fact, absent the 
REC Rule, the market might produce greater equity in coaching talent, because a school with a less-prominent basketball 
program might be able to entice a more-experienced coach away from a prominent program by offering a higher salary."
1557,16," Because we hold that the NCAA did not establish evidence of sufficient procompetitive benefits, we need not address 
question of whether the plaintiffs were able to show that comparable procompetitive benefits could be achieved through viable, 
less anticompetitive means. See I ABA Section of Antitrust Law, supra, at 66 (collecting cases); Areeda, supra, P 1502, at 372 
(if the defendant proves procompetitive justifications, the plaintiff must demonstrate that less restrictive means could have been 
used to achieve the same results to prevail under the rule of reason analysis). "
1562,1," The players had originally asserted this claim against the United States Soccer Federation, Inc. (the ""USSF""), ""as well, but 
USSF has since entered into a stipulation that it never has and never will pay nor request a transfer fee payment for an out-of-
contract player. As a result, the players have withdrawn Count II as against the USSF. The USSF has no teams of its own, so it 
is unlikely that it would have paid a transfer fee absent the stipulation. "
1563,2," It may be noted that MLS's obligation, as a member of FIFA, to observe the federation's rules is sufficient to constitute a 
""contract, combination . . . or conspiracy"" within the scope of the Sherman Act's prohibition. See Hennessey v. National 
Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 564 F.2d 1136, 1147 (5th Cir. 1997) (adherence to a trade association by law may suffice to establish 
""the agreement and concert of action of the various members of the association""). "
1569,1," Claiming that it has not yet been served, defendant TCI did not join this motion. "
1570,2," For the purposes of this Memorandum, plaintiff's First Amended Complaint shall be referred to as ""the complaint"" and cited as 
""Compl."" Plaintiff's Complaint shall be referred to as ""the original complaint."" "
1582,1," Although Precision still exists as a corporate entity, it ceased operations on December 31, 1996."
1582,2," Much of the paper Precision purchased consisted of carbonless forms paper, dkt. no. 25, at 151, which came directly from 
Appleton Paper, was priced solely by Appleton, and only passed through Unisource, which acted merely as a sales agent on 
those transactions. Because Precision played no part in the pricing of carbonless forms paper, I will not consider sales of that 
type of paper in my antitrust analysis. "
1583,3," In May 1995, Precision stopped making its debt reduction payments and Unisource filed a collection suit in the Allegheny 
County Court of Common Pleas, which is docketed at GD 05-20037 and is still pending. "
1584,4," The Robinson-Patman Act is, in actuality, a 1936 legislative amendment of the 1914 provisions of the Clayton Act. See 49 Stat. 
1526 (1936); 38 Stat. 730 (1914). Thus, the Clayton and Robinson-Patman acts will be referred to interchangeably, except 
where the difference is significant."
1584,5," The Act has been assailed on policy grounds as well, the most frequent criticism being that its prohibitions on price 
discrimination protect inefficient competitors at the expense of consumer welfare, placing the Act in tension with the remainder of 
antitrust law. See, e.g., Bork, supra, at 382-94. Indeed, the government, which has responsibility for enforcing the Act's 
provisions, has largely ignored it in recent times. See Holmes, supra, at 484 (noting that the United States Department of Justice 
""has been openly critical of the Act for several years and has refrained from actively enforcing it""); ABA Treatise, supra, at 430 
(""government enforcement generally has been limited to FTC cases, and FTC enforcement of the Act in the last fifteen years has 
been minimal""). For purposes of adjudicating this case, of course, such criticism carries no weight; this court's task--and its only 
task absent unconstitutionality--is faithfully to apply any statute that Congress has enacted. "
1585,6," This statutorily imposed ""in commerce nexus"" is a significantly higher burden than that present under the Commerce Clause in 
general, or the Sherman Act in particular. 419 U.S. at 194-95. The commerce requirement under the Robinson-Patman Act, 
therefore, is properly viewed as both a substantive and jurisdictional prerequisite for the imposition of liability. "
1586,7," The Zoslaw court acknowledged the Supreme Court's decision in Copp and held, along with two other circuits, that the stream 
of commerce doctrine retained its viability after that case. Id. at 878 n.10 (citing cases). "
1587,8," Of course, if Precision's competitors made any ""spot"" purchases, that is, purchases not covered by a JIT or similar agreement, 
those sales would, like Precision's, have to be considered intrastate in character."
1587,9," Although not relevant to the instant discussion, the precise number of discriminatory sales bears heavily on the issues of 
economic harm and damages. "
1588,10," But see Stephen Calkins, Copperweld in the Courts: The Road to Caribe, 63 Antitrust L.J. 345 (1995) (criticizing Caribe's 
extension of Copperweld to the Robinson-Patman Act). "
1590,11," Even if the truckload were shipped out of the general inventory of a Unisource warehouse in another state, the fact remains 
that Precision had the opportunity to buy by the truckload--and had done so in the past--but declined to avail itself of that 
purchasing option during the time period relevant to this litigation. "
1591,12," An interesting issue that arises under this language is whether, in a secondary line price discrimination case, the favored 
competitor must have actual knowledge of the discrimination. The statute, as set forth in the main text, proscribes price 
discrimination where its effect may be to ""prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the 
benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them[.]"" 15 U.S.C. § 13(a) (emphasis added). Preventing 
competition with the grantor (Unisource) is not an issue here, because this is not a primary line case, and there is no cited 
evidence in the record that Thornhill or BFI knew they were receiving better prices than Precision was being charged. In order to 
find competitive injury, then, I must rely upon the language referring to ""with customers of either of them,"" specifically Precision's 
competition with Thornhill and BFI as the common customers of Unisource. Such a construction of the statutory text is plausible, 
but it tends to render ""knowingly receives"" as surplusage, in derogation of long-recognized canons of construction, under which 
courts should give meaning and effect to every word and phrase in a statute. Applying that canon, it would appear that the 
""customers of"" language was included only to make ""tertiary line"" cases actionable and not to eliminate the knowledge 
requirement in secondary line cases. Because neither party raises this issue, and I have found no authority resolving it, I will 
proceed on the assumption that knowledge on the part of the favored purchaser is not required. "
1593,13," See 13 P.S. § 2202. Precision does not attempt to argue that the integration clause, if a part of the parties' contract vel non, 
was not ""intended . . . as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement."" Id. Thus, to the extent the parol 
evidence rule applies, as discussed infra both consistent and contradictory oral evidence must be excluded. See id. "
1594,14," HN20[
] That section provides that a merchant is someone who ""deals in goods of the kind[,] or otherwise by his occupation 
holds himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices or goods involved in the transaction. . . ."" 13 P.S. § 2104. 
Comment 2 states that, under § 2-207, ""almost every person in business would . . . be deemed to be a merchant. . . ."" Here, 
both parties regularly deal in bulk paper, and must therefore be considered merchants within the meaning of this section."
1594,15," Precision also attempts to use these statements to prove a course of dealing, as permitted by 13 P.S. § 2202(1). Under 13 
P.S. § 1204, ""[a] course of dealing is a sequence of previous conduct between the parties to a particular transaction which is 
fairly to be regarded as establishing a common basis of understanding for interpreting their expressions and other conduct."" Put 
another way, the manner in which the parties performed in a previous similar sales transaction provides a basis for interpreting 
what their contract requires of them under their present contract. Here, however, no evidence is cited or argued to indicate that 
Unisource ever gave Precision the favorable prices to which it claims it was entitled. Without such evidence of past performance, 
Precision can only establish a ""course of promises,"" not a course of dealing. This argument, then, is nothing more than an 
attempt to use parol evidence to prove what Unisource allegedly promised. Course of performance, which is admissible to 
explain or supplement even a fully integrated writing under UCC § 2-202, should not be permitted to be used as a ""bootstrap"" to 
avoid the stricter provisions of the parol evidence rule for complete and exclusive writings. "
1595,16," This state court holding would raise the question of preclusion if the judgment has become final. Because it is not clear from 
the record whether it has, I will proceed to decide the issue de novo. "
1596,17," These weaknesses in Precision's fraud theory are further exacerbated by the difficulty, discussed supra in the disposition of 
the breach of contract claim, of finding that Unisource ever made any specific promise. "
