 229 ,"20  Columbia Steel Columbia Steel  involved the cash purchase by United States Steel Corporation of the physical assets of Consolidated Steel  Corporation; there was no exchange of shares and no alteration of Consolidated's corporate identity.  See Transcript of Record,   United States v. Columbia Steel Co., 334 U.S. 495  (No. 461, October Term, 1947), pp. 453-475.  As a result of the purchase, in  its horizontal aspect, U.S. Steel controlled about 24% of the structural steel fabricating market in an 11-state western area.  This  Court held that the acquisition could not be reached under  § 7  of the  Clayton Act, see  334 U.S., at 507, n. 7 , and did not violate  the Sherman Act. It should be noted, however, that the Court regarded the 24% market-share figure proposed by the  Government as a ""doubtful assumption"" and also pointed to ""unusual conditions"" tending to mitigate the anticompetitive effect of  the acquisition.   334 U.S., at 529 .  Columbia Steel  was repeatedly cited by Congressmen considering the amendment of  § 7  as  an example of what they conceived to be the inability of the Sherman Act, as then construed, to deal with the problems of  corporate concentration.

 230 ,"22  A cash purchase of another bank's assets would not seem to be a fully effective method of corporate acquisition. In other A cash purchase of another bank's assets would not seem to be a fully effective method of corporate acquisition. In other  industries, a cash purchase of plant, inventory, patents, trade secrets, and the like will often directly enhance the competitive  position of the acquiring corporation, as in  Columbia Steel Co . But a bank desiring to increase its share of banking business  through corporate acquisition would ordinarily need to acquire the other bank's deposits and capital, not merely its assets.  For  more deposits mean more working capital, and additions to capital and surplus increase the lending limit.  A cash purchase, in  effect, only substitutes cash for cash, since bank assets consist principally of cash and very liquid securities and loans  receivable, and adds nothing to the acquiring bank's capital and surplus or to its working capital.  True, an exchange of its stock  for assets would achieve the acquiring bank's objectives.  We are clear, however, that in light of Congress' overriding purpose, in  amending  § 7 , to close the loophole in the original section, if such an exchange (or other clearly evasive transaction) were  tantamount in its effects to a merger, the exchange would not be an ""assets"" acquisition within the meaning of  § 7  but would be  treated as a transaction subject to that section."

In the instant case, unlike  Aluminum  Co ., there is virtually no time lag between the banks' furnishing competing financial institutions (small-loan companies, for  example) with the raw material,  i. e ., money, and the institutions' selling the finished product,  i. e ., loans; hence the instant case,  compared with  Aluminum Co . in this respect, is  a fortiori .  As one banker testified quite frankly in the instant case in response to  the question: ""Do you feel that you are in substantial competition with these institutions [personal-finance and sales-finance  companies] that you lend . . . such money to for loans that you want to make?"" -- ""Oh, no, we definitely do not.  If we did, we  would stop making the loans to them."" (R. 298.) The reason for the competitive disadvantage of most lending institutions  vis-a- vis  banks is that only banks obtain the bulk of their working capital without having to pay interest or comparable charges thereon,  by virtue of their unique power to accept demand deposits. The critical area of short-term commercial credit, see pp. 326-327,  supra , appears to be one in which banks have little effective competition, save in the case of very large companies which can  meet their financing needs from retained earnings or from issuing securities or paper."

There is no evidence of the amount of business done in the area by banks with offices outside the area; it  may be that such figures are unobtainable.  In any event, it would seem from the local orientation of banking insofar as smaller  customers are concerned, see notes 35 and 36,  supra , that competition from outside the area would only be important to the  larger borrowers and depositors.  If so, the four-county area remains a valid geographical market in which to assess the  anticompetitive effect of the proposed merger upon the banking facilities available to the smaller customer -- a perfectly good  ""line of commerce,"" in light of Congress' evident concern, in enacting the 1950 amendments to  § 7 , with preserving small  business.  See  Brown Shoe Co., supra , at 315-316.  As a practical matter the small businessman can only satisfy his credit  needs at local banks.  To be sure, there is still some artificiality in deeming the four-county area the relevant ""section of the  country"" so far as businessmen located near the perimeter are concerned.  But such fuzziness would seem inherent in any  attempt to delineate the relevant geographical market.  Note,  52 Col. L. Rev. 766, 778-779, n. 77 (1952). And it is notable that  outside the four-county area, appellees' business rapidly thins out.

Bok's  principal test is increase in market concentration, and he suggests a figure of 7% or 8%.  And consult note 20,  supra .  We  intimate no view on the validity of such tests for we have no need to consider percentages smaller than those in the case at bar,  but we note that such tests are more rigorous than is required to dispose of the instant case.  Needless to say, the fact that a  merger results in a less-than-30% market share, or in a less substantial increase in concentration than in the instant case, does  not raise an inference that the merger is  not  violative of  § 7 .

Those cursory treatments go no further than the view, with  which I wholly agree, that no blanket exemption from § 2 (a) is available for private label brands.

Nor is there any issue raised here as to whether, under a market test of § 2 (a), a dubious pricing and branding policy  adopted by a seller could ""validate itself"" and escape the Act by creating precarious distinctions in grade or quality.  The price  differential between Borden's premium and private label brands is concededly grounded upon a legitimate and stable market  preference for the premium product.  Moreover, the Commission's willingness to engage in the exhaustive analysis of injury to  competition and cost justification under its ""physical identity"" test of § 2 (a) demonstrates that the Commission's resources would  be more than adequate to determine the level of commercial preference sufficient to negate a finding of ""like grade and quality""  under a market test of § 2 (a)."

One such group, whose purchases accounted for 11% of Borden's private label volume  in 1957, had more than 1,000 retailer members.  Not all retailers, however, availed themselves of the opportunity to market  private label milk. One wholesaler testified that, a year after his private label brand had been offered to the 600 retail grocers in  his service area, only 50 of the grocers had become regular customers."

Shopping Bag operated 36 stores in Los Angeles at the time of the merger; it commenced operation as a partnership in a small  grocery store in 1930.  So far as the record reveals, the competitive behavior of these firms was impeccable throughout their  expansion, which took place solely by internal growth.  In discussing the success of comparable firms  vis-a-vis  the Sherman Act,  Judge Learned Hand stated, ""The Act does not mean to condemn the resultant of those very forces which it is its prime object to  foster: finis opus coronat.

The merger involved in  Philadelphia Nat. Bank  produced a single firm  controlling 30% of the market, and resulted in an increase from 44% to 59% in the market share of the two largest firms in the  market.  The Court's opinion is remarkable for its failure to support its conclusion by reference to even a single piece of  economic theory.  I shall not dwell here on the barometers of competition that have been suggested by the commentators.  But it  seems important to note that the present merger falls either outside, or at the very fringe, of the various mechanical tests that  have been proposed.  See,  e. g ., Kaysen & Turner, Antitrust Policy 133-136 (1959) (horizontal merger with direct competitor is  prima facie unlawful where acquiring company accounts for 20% or more of the market, or where merging companies together  constitute 20% or more of the market; acquisitions producing less than 20% market control unlawful only where special  circumstances are present, such as serious barriers to entry or substantial influence on prices by the acquired company); Stigler,  Mergers and Preventive Antitrust Policy,  104 U. Pa. L. Rev. 176, 179-182 (1955) (acquisition unlawful if it produces a combined  market share of 20% or more; acquisition permitted if the combined share is less than 5-10%); Bok, Section 7 of the Clayton Act  and the Merging of Law and Economics,  74 Harv. L. Rev. 226, 308-329 (1960) (no merger by the dominant firm in an industry if  its market share is increased by more than 2-3%; no merger by other large firms in the industry where the combined market  shares of the two-to-eight largest firms after the merger are increased by 7-8% or more over the shares that existed at any time  during the preceding 5-10 years; no merger where acquired firm has 5% market share or more).  See also Markham, Merger  Policy Under the New Section 7: A Six-Year Appraisal,  43 Va. L. Rev. 489, 521-522 (1957).

The machinery by which the Commission procures compliance with its orders is, and always has been, spelled out by  statute.  Until 1959, one could with impunity violate an FTC Clayton Act order.  Such an order was not final until the respondent  sought judicial review and a Court of Appeals granted enforcement.  Disobedience thereafter was a contempt of court.  In the  event the respondent did not seek review, the Commission was required to ascertain that he was violating its order and then  proceed,  pursuant to express statutory provision  ( 15 U. S.

The court's reliance upon the stipulation as a basis for its decision to enter judgment against  Hazeltine as well as HRI is reflected by the interchanges between the court and counsel for Hazeltine during those proceedings.   An example is the following:"
 507 ,"4  There is some indication that the genesis of the stipulation was a pretrial conference, when a question was raised as to There is some indication that the genesis of the stipulation was a pretrial conference, when a question was raised as to  whether or not a subpoena served upon HRI could reach certain records of Hazeltine relating to the latter's foreign patents.  Hazeltine, of course, argues that the stipulation's only purpose and effect were to facilitate discovery and trial by obviating the  necessity of litigating whether or not Zenith could ""pierce the corporate veil"" between HRI and its parent."
 507 ,"5  In its brief in this Court, Zenith seems to argue that Hazeltine is estopped to deny that it is bound by the stipulation.  Not only In its brief in this Court, Zenith seems to argue that Hazeltine is estopped to deny that it is bound by the stipulation.  Not only  was HRI's counsel, Dodds, an officer of Hazeltine, but also Ruestow and Westermann, Hazeltine's general patent counsel and  general counsel, were present during trial and failed to ""repudiate"" the construction allegedly given the stipulation by the parties  at trial to the effect that it bound Hazeltine to any adjudication on the counterclaim. We find this theory untenable on the record of  this case, for the references during trial to the stipulation are equally consistent with the interpretation advanced by Hazeltine  that the stipulation merely eliminated the necessity for Zenith to perform the time-consuming task of piercing the corporate veil in  proving its counterclaim against HRI.  Also, Ruestow and Westermann were called as witnesses during trial, and assuming they  were present throughout the trial -- a fact which is neither proved nor disproved by the record -- their failure to repudiate Zenith's  proposed construction of the stipulation is entirely consistent with the proposition that they were present only as witnesses, and  not as authorized representatives for a person who might be bound by the litigation."
 507 ,"6  Just as the Just as the  alter ego  issue was not litigated after Hazeltine had made its special appearance and while it had an opportunity to  be heard, see  supra, at 111 , so the District Court evidently did not rely upon anything more than the stipulation as a basis for  entering the injunction against Hazeltine as well as HRI.  The record does not support the contention, implicit in Zenith's brief,  that when Hazeltine appeared to contest jurisdiction it was found by the District Court to be ""in active concert or participation"" "
 508 ,"7  Although HRI and Hazeltine were not parties to this prior litigation and did not enter the settlement agreement, HRI urged that Although HRI and Hazeltine were not parties to this prior litigation and did not enter the settlement agreement, HRI urged that  all joint tortfeasors, including HRI and Hazeltine, were released from liability for injuries flowing from the pre-settlement acts of  the pools. The 1957 release appears to be relevant only to Zenith's claim for injury to its Canadian trade; the embargoes in  England and Australia were thought by the District Court to preclude any injury from acts of the English and Australian pools,  and the embargoes were not lifted until well after the settlement was executed."
 508 ,"8  The Court of Appeals did not disturb, nor do we, the findings of the District Court that HRI and Hazeltine conspired with the The Court of Appeals did not disturb, nor do we, the findings of the District Court that HRI and Hazeltine conspired with the  Canadian pool to deny patent licenses to companies seeking to export American-made goods to Canada.  Accepting these  findings, we have no doubt that the Sherman Act was violated.  See,  e. g.,  Timken Roller Bearing Co. v.  United States, 341 U.S.  593, 599 (1951) ;  Continental Ore Co. v.

On the basis of this statement, HRI argues that Zenith precluded itself from  recovering damages resulting from pre-answer conduct.  This argument is not persuasive.  The counterclaim itself was not so  limited, and Zenith made its position on damages absolutely clear by the opening of trial.  HRI was thereby given both ample  notice of the substance of Zenith's claim and ample opportunity to respond, but made no effort during trial to do so."

HRI can point to no direct evidence that Congress ever considered the  issue now before us or voiced any views upon it; on the contrary, it appears that Congress left the matter for authoritative  resolution in the courts.

The District Court apparently agreed with Topco that the complaint did not cover customer limitations,  but permitted the Government to pursue this line on the basis that if the limitations were proved, the complaint could later be  amended.  App. 141.  Topco acquiesced in this procedure, and both sides dealt with customer limitations in examining  witnesses.  The District Court made specific findings and conclusions with respect to the totality of the restraints on wholesaling.   In light of these facts, the additional fact that the complaint was never formally amended should not bar our consideration of the  issue."

Topco expands on this conclusion in its brief by asserting that ""the evidence is uncontradicted that a member has never failed to  build a new store because it was unable to obtain a license."" Brief for Appellee 18 n. 18.  The problem with the conclusion of the  District Court and the assertion by Topco is that they are wholly inconsistent with the notion that territorial divisions are crucial to  the existence of Topco, as urged by the association and found by the District Court.  From the filing of its answer to the  argument before this Court, Topco has maintained that without a guarantee of an exclusive territory, prospective licensees would  not join Topco and present licensees would leave the association.  It is difficult to understand how Topco can make this  argument and simultaneously urge that territorial restrictions are an unimportant factor in the decision of a member on whether  to expand its business."

Moreover, it would be, to say the least, extraordinary  for Congress to have resorted to such a subtle method of establishing for the first time in Government civil antitrust cases  interlocutory appeals for orders of the type specified in  § 1292 (a)  without giving any hint whatsoever that this was its purpose."

Although appeals of such orders would involve the merits of the antitrust actions, the fact is that  permitting interlocutory appeal under  § 1292 (b)  would not bring these orders and the related evidence before the courts of  appeals since they come within  § 1292 (a)(1) .  Cf. n. 41,  supra .  Moreover, because of the need for speed if an acquisition is to  be enjoined before accomplished, requests for such interlocutory orders must be determined after, at most, only an initial  hearing and without full development of the record.  Consequently, appeals from such orders would not necessarily bring before  the courts of appeals the lengthy records and numerous documents with which we have often been forced to deal after final  judgment."

But ""surely one premise of an antimerger statute  such as § 7 is that corporate growth by internal expansion is socially preferable to growth by acquisition.""   United States v.  Philadelphia National Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 370 (1963) . Moreover, entry by acquisition has the added evil of eliminating one firm  in the market and thus increasing the burden on the remaining firms which must compete with the dominant entering firm."
 661 ,"14  Thus, whereas the practical difference between entry by acquisition and entry Thus, whereas the practical difference between entry by acquisition and entry  de novo  may be marginal in the case of a  dominant entrant, see n. 13,  supra , it is crucial in the case of a perceived potential entrant. If the perceived potential entrant  enters  de novo , its deterrent effect on anticompetitive practices remains and the total number of firms competing for market  shares increases.  But when such a firm enters by acquisition, it merely steps into the shoes of the acquired firm.  The result is  no net increase in the actual competition for market shares and the removal of a threat exerting procompetitive influence from  outside the market."
 661 ,"15  Still, even if the market is presently competitive, it is possible that it might grow less competitive in the future.  For example, a Still, even if the market is presently competitive, it is possible that it might grow less competitive in the future.  For example, a  market might be so concentrated that even though it is presently competitive, there is a serious risk that parallel pricing policies  might emerge sometime in the near future.  In such a situation, an effective competitor lingering on the fringe of the market --  what might be called a  potential  perceived potential entrant -- could exert a deterrent force when anticompetitive conduct is  about to emerge.  As its very name suggests, however, such a firm would be still a further step removed from the exertion of  actual, present competitive influence, and the problems of proof are compounded accordingly -- particularly in light of the  showing of reasonable probability required under § 7."
 661 ,"16  However, if the acquired firm is strengthened to such an extent that it upsets the market balance and drives its competitors out However, if the acquired firm is strengthened to such an extent that it upsets the market balance and drives its competitors out  of the market, the acquiring firm takes on the characteristics of a dominant entrant, and the merger may therefore violate § 7  under that theory.

 664 ,"19  It might be argued that economic decisions are ""inherently subjective"" and that any attempt to derive objective conclusions It might be argued that economic decisions are ""inherently subjective"" and that any attempt to derive objective conclusions  from economic data is futile.  If this observation means that different people reach different conclusions from the same objective  data, then the point must, of course, be conceded.  Similarly, if the point is that economic predictions are difficult and fraught with  uncertainty, it is well taken.  As we recognized in  United States  v.  Philadelphia National Bank , such questions are ""not . . .  susceptible of a ready and precise answer in most cases.""   374 U.S., at 362 . But although the factual controversies in § 7 cases  may prove difficult to resolve, the statutory scheme clearly demands their resolution.  As this Court held years ago, in response  to a similar argument: ""So far as the arguments proceed upon the conception that in view of the generality of the statute it is not  susceptible of being enforced by the courts because it cannot be carried out without a judicial exertion of legislative power, they  are clearly unsound.  The statute certainly generically enumerates the character of acts which it prohibits and the wrong which it  was intended to prevent.  The propositions therefore but insist that . . . it never can be left to the judiciary to decide whether in a  given case particular acts come within a generic statutory provision.  But to reduce the propositions, however, to this their final  meaning makes it clear that in substance they deny the existence of essential legislative authority and challenge the right of the  judiciary to perform duties which that department of the government has exerted from the beginning.""  Standard Oil Co . v.   United  States, 221 U.S. 1, 69-70 (1911) . Section 7 by its terms requires the trial judge to make a prediction, and it is entirely possible  that others may reasonably disagree with the conclusion he reaches.  But a holding that the fact of such disagreement requires  the judge to delegate his decisionmaking authority to one of the parties would strike at the heart of the very notion of judicial  conflict resolution.  While it may be true that different people see economic facts in different light, § 7 gives federal judges and  juries the responsibility to reach  their  conclusions as to the economic facts.  And ""if justice requires the fact to be ascertained,  the difficulty of doing so is no ground for refusing to try."" O. Holmes, The Common Law 48."

But such a corporation is  exceedingly unlikely to become the defendant in a § 7 lawsuit.

Prior to passage of the Clayton Act, labor union practices had been held by this Court to  affect   commerce and thus to fall within the reach of the Sherman Act, despite the fact that the union activities could not be regarded as  being in the flow of commerce.  Loewe v. Lawlor, 208 U.S. 274, 300-301 (1908) . See also  Teamsters Local 167 v. United States,  291 U.S. 293, 297 (1934) ;  Apex Hosiery Co . v.  Leader, 310 U.S. 469 (1940) ;  United States v.

If the Court is right today in saying that ""in commerce"" as used in the Clayton Act is to be read more  restrictively than the Sherman Act, then those who drafted the Clayton Act (including Louis D. Brandeis) to protect labor were  needlessly concerned -- no express exemption of labor would have been necessary, since the ""in commerce"" language of the  Clayton Act (if narrowly read) would not have supported judicial attempts to reach labor activities on an ""affecting commerce""  theory.

For that proposition the dissenting opinion relies upon ""considerable evidence  in the legislative materials."" Post, at 650.  In our view, these materials are unpersuasive. In the first place, Congress did not  amend § 303 expressly to provide a remedy for violations of § 8(e). See Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of  1959, §§ 704(d), (e), 73 Stat. 544-545. The House in 1959 did reject proposals by Representatives Hiestand, Alger, and  Hoffman to repeal labor's antitrust immunity. Post, at 650-654. Those proposals, however, were much broader than the issue in  this case. The Hiestand-Alger proposal would have repealed antitrust immunity for any action in concert by two or more labor  organizations. The Hoffman proposal apparently intended to repeal labor's antitrust immunity entirely. That the Congress  rejected these extravagant proposals hardly furnishes proof that it intended to extend labor's antitrust immunity to include  agreements with nonlabor parties, or that it thought antitrust liability under the existing statutes would be inconsistent with the  NLRA. The bill introduced by Senator McClellan two years later provides even less support for that proposition. Like most bills  introduced in Congress, it never reached a vote."

Connell obtained a temporary  restraining order against the picketing on January 21, 1971, and thereafter executed the contract - under protest - with Local 100  on March 28, 1971. So far as the record in this case reveals, there has been no further picketing at Connell's construction sites.  Accordingly, there is no occasion for us to consider whether the Norris-LaGuardia Act forbids such an injunction where the  specific agreement sought by the union is illegal, or to determine whether, within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, there  was a ""labor dispute"" between these parties. If the Norris-LaGuardia Act were applicable to this picketing, injunctive relief would  not be available under the antitrust laws. See  United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U.S. 219 (1941) . If the agreement in question is  held on remand to be invalid under federal antitrust laws, we cannot anticipate that Local 100 will resume picketing to obtain or  enforce an illegal agreement."

Moreover, if Connell had truly agreed to limit its subcontracting without any coercion whatsoever on the part of  Local 100, the affected subcontractor might well have a valid antitrust claim on the ground that Local 100 and Connell were  engaged in the type of conspiracy aimed at third parties with which this Court dealt in  Allen Bradley Co. v.

Appellees have argued that Stone Mountain represents a  unique case because a majority of voting stock remained in the hands of a single family not intimately tied to the C&S system.  This contention is not wholly supported by the record, since in his trial testimony Mr. Mills Lane, President of C&S from 1946 to  1970, referred to three other banks having a similar structure of ownership.

Once established, per se rules tend to provide guidance to the business community and to minimize the burdens  on litigants and the judicial system of the more complex rule-of-reason trials, see  Northern Pac.

There are, however, significant differences that could easily justify  different treatment.  In his concurring opinion in White Motor Co. v. United States, MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN noted that, unlike  nonprice restrictions, ""[r]esale price maintenance is not only designed to, but almost invariably does in fact, reduce price  competition not only among sellers of the affected product, but quite as much between that product and competing brands.""  372  U.S. 268 .

This isolated reference has provoked sharp criticism from virtually all of the commentators on  the decision, most of whom have regarded the Court's apparent reliance on the ""ancient rule"" as both a misreading of legal  history and a perversion of antitrust analysis.

The Court also broadly hinted that it would recognize additional exceptions to the per se rule for new entrants in an  industry and for failing firms, both of which were mentioned in White Motor as candidates for such exceptions.   388 U.S., at 374 .  The Court might have limited the exceptions to the per se rule to these situations, which present the strongest arguments for the  sacrifice of intrabrand competition for interbrand competition.  Significantly, it chose instead to create the more extensive  exception for nonsale transactions which is available to all businesses, regardless of their size, financial health, or market share.  This broader exception demonstrates even more clearly the Court's awareness of the ""redeeming virtues"" of vertical restrictions."

As a result of statutory and common-law developments, society increasingly demands that  manufacturers assume direct responsibility for the safety and quality of their products.  For example, at the federal level, apart  from more specialized requirements, manufacturers of consumer products have safety responsibilities under the Consumer  Product Safety Act,  15 U.S.C.  § 2051 et seq. (1970 ed., Supp. V) , and obligations for warranties under the Consumer Product  Warranties Act,  15 U. S. C.  § 2301 et seq. (1970 ed., Supp. V) .  Similar obligations are imposed by state law.  See, e.g.,  Cal.  Civ. Code § 1790 et seq.  (West 1973).  The legitimacy of these concerns has been recognized in cases involving vertical  restrictions.  See, e.g.,  Tripoli Co. v.

This argument is flawed by its necessary assumption that a large part of  the promotional efforts resulting from vertical restrictions will not convey socially desirable information about product availability,  price, quality, and services.

But this conclusion does not at all follow from the premise that judicial decisions have construed the  prohibition of the antitrust laws to include sham and frivolous state-court proceedings - a premise with which we do not at all  disagree, see n. 6, supra. The conclusion is supportable only as a matter of policy preference, and not of statutory construction.   Under MR.

But this approach flies in the face of our past  decisions.  For example, in  Mitchum v.

However, the Court in Mitchum found no such ipso facto shortcut to the explicit prohibition of  § 2283 , but resorted to  careful analysis of the legislative history in order to find evidence of congressional authorization. In short, MR.

Detroit Edison, an electric utility  regulated by Michigan, was charged by an independent seller of light bulbs with antitrust violations in the operation of a program  which provided light bulbs without extra cost to electricity customers. Detroit Edison, relying on Parker, defended on the ground  that the light-bulb program was included in its rate filed with and approved by the State Public Service Commission and that  state law required it to follow the terms of the tariff as long as it was in effect.  Cantor rejected the claim, holding that since no  Michigan statutes regulated the light-bulb industry, and since neither the Michigan Legislature nor the Public Service  Commission had passed upon the desirability of such a light-bulb program, the Commission's approval of Detroit Edison's  program did not ""implement any statewide policy relating to light blubs"" and that ""the State's policy is neutral on the question  whether a utility should, or should not, have such a program.""  428 U.S., at 585 .

Unless this requirement is  to be abandoned, it seems clear that inadequate information will, in a limited number of cases, deny the defense to some who, if  all the facts had been known, would have been entitled to invoke it.  For reasons already discussed, interseller verification does  not provide a satisfactory solution to this seemingly inevitable problem of inadequate information.  Moreover, § 2 (b) affords only  a defense to liability and not an affirmative right under the Act.

That  case involved an organization of fire insurance companies, and much of the congressional discussion accordingly concerned  alleged abuses by and regulation of such companies.

See Joint Hearing before the  Subcommittees of the Committees on the Judiciary on S. 1362 et al., 78th Cong., 1st Sess. (1943).  Since fire insurers paid their  policyholders cash indemnities, these companies had no reason to contract with third parties for the provision of goods or  services.  That fact fully explains the absence of discussion of such contracts in the congressional debates.  Such absence no  more indicates a congressional intent to exclude provider agreements from the ""business of insurance"" than does the absence  of any mention of health insurance companies indicate a congressional intent arbitrarily to exclude all health insurance from the  ""business of insurance."""

The argument, therefore, is better directed to the legislature, which has the  power to modify or repeal McCarran-Ferguson, rather than to this Court.  Referral to the legislators is particularly appropriate in  this case, as the policy aspects may not be as one-sided as those painted by the Court.  There is authority for the proposition  that provider agreements, far from increasing costs, constitute an effective means for reduction in health-care prices and  premiums. Council on Wage and Price Stability, Employee Health Care Benefits: Labor and Management Sponsored  Innovations in Controlling Cost,  41 Fed. Reg. 40298, 40305 (1976) . And the argument that ""there is little incentive on the part of  Blue Shield to minimize costs, since it is in the interest of the providers to set fee schedules at the highest possible level""  overlooks the vital consideration that many if not most of these plans originate in collective-bargaining agreements where ""the  consumer power and negotiating expertise of organized labor"" combine to ""reduce the unit price of health services.""  Ibid .   Control over provider agreements by state insurance commissioners constitutes a second ""incentive"" operating in the same  direction.  See n. 18,  supra .

Scale wages are set by a collective-bargaining agreement between  Equity and the producers, to which the agents are not parties.  When an agent represents an actor or actress whose  professional reputation is not sufficient to demand a salary higher than scale, the agent hopes to develop a relationship that will  become continually more remunerative as the performer's professional reputation grows, and with it the power to demand an  ever higher salary. No agent is required to represent an actor or actress whom he does not wish to represent."

There the union feared that the ""vendor system"" was designed to  escape the payment of union wages and the assumption of union-imposed working conditions.  In  Oliver I , the  Milk Wagon  Drivers  decision was invoked to protect from state antitrust challenge a union's successful efforts to prescribe through collective- bargaining agreements a wage scale for truck-drivers, and minimum rental fees for drivers who owned their own trucks.  The  union feared that driver-owners, whose fees included not only an entrepreneurial component but also a ""wage"" for the labor of  driving, might undercut the union scale by charging a fee that effectively included a subscale wage component.

More significantly, the Court does not make  clear which, if any, of the state decisions it relies upon held the principal liable for punitive damages upon the apparent authority  of an agent acting without any intention of benefiting the principal.  I had thought that this was the question before us.

Yet the The intersection of the law of agency and vicarious liability with the law of conspiracy makes this a complex case.  Yet the  Court does not recognize this complexity.  It so expands the concept of vicarious liability as to leave little content, in this case, to  the requirement in  § 1  of the Sherman Act that antitrust plaintiffs demonstrate a contract, combination, or conspiracy.  Indeed,  the Court never identifies who conspired with whom.  Did James -- acting for ASME -- conspire with Hardin -- acting for  McDonnell & Miller, Inc., and Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Co.?  Or was it the other way around?  Could it be  said, under the Court's theory, that James had conspired with himself -- as a double agent -- thereby committing both of his  ""principals"" to an antitrust conspiracy?  In my view, it makes more sense to view the matter as a conspiracy between the agents  of McDonnell & Miller, Inc., and Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Co.

It would seem that an insurer could simply  bypass the foundation by performing the canvassing function and dealing with the doctors itself.  Under the foundation plan,  each doctor must look at the maximum-fee schedule fixed by his competitors and vote for or against approval of the plan (and, if  the plan is approved by majority vote, he must continue or revoke his foundation membership).

From this premise the dissent reasons that since ""claims adjustment is part and parcel of the 'business of  insurance' protected by the McCarran-Ferguson Act,""  post , at 138, it necessarily follows that the peer review practices at issue in  these cases must enjoy the Act's exemption.

As the Court of Appeals noted: ""Opinions of the committee are not binding unless the parties agree beforehand  that they will be.""  650 F.2d, at 388 . Thus in a case such as the present ones, ULL is perfectly free to disregard the Committee's  evaluation.  Even if ULL were to act upon the Committee's opinion, the nonbinding nature of the Committee's evaluation means  that, at most, peer review is merely ancillary to the claims adjustment process.  We see no reason that such ancillary activities  must necessarily enjoy the McCarran-Ferguson exemption from the antitrust laws.

The policyowners could obtain medication from  participating pharmacies simply by paying the amount that otherwise would not be covered by the insurance plan.  The  pharmacies thus constituted nothing more than in-kind dispensers of insurance payments; they played no role whatsoever in the  more fundamental process of assessing the validity of a claim and determining the amount to be paid.

Plumbers & Steamfitters, 421 U.S.  616 (1975) . The plaintiff in that case, a general building contractor, was coerced by the defendant union into signing an  agreement not to deal with nonunion subcontractors. Similarly, in the  McCready  case, the plaintiff was the direct victim of  unlawful coercion. As the Court noted, ""McCready did not yield to Blue Shield's coercive pressure, and bore Blue Shield's  sanction in the form of an increase in the net cost of her psychologist's services.""  457 U.S., at 483 . Her status was thus  comparable to that of a contracting or subcontracting firm that refused to yield to the defendants' coercive practices and  therefore suffered whatever sanction that coercion imposed.  Like McCready, and like Connell Construction Co., such a firm  could maintain an action against the defendants.  In contrast, the Union is neither a participant in the market for construction  contracts or subcontracts nor a direct victim of the defendants' coercive practices.  We therefore need not decide whether the  direct victim of a boycott, who suffers a type of injury unrelated to antitrust policy, may recover damages when the ultimate  purpose of the boycott is to restrain competition in the relevant economic market."

1230 ,"46  Because of the absence of specific allegations, we can only speculate about the specific components of the Union's claim.  If Because of the absence of specific allegations, we can only speculate about the specific components of the Union's claim.  If  the Union asserts that its attempts to organize previously nonunion firms have been frustrated because nonunion firms wish to  continue to obtain business from those subjected to coercion by the defendants, its harm stems most directly from the conduct of  persons who are not victims of the conspiracy. See n. 14,  supra .  If the Union claims that dues payments were adversely  affected because employees had less incentive to join the Union in light of expanding nonunion job opportunities, its damage is  more remote than the harm allegedly suffered by unionized subcontractors. The same is true if the Union contends that  revenues from dues payments declined because its members lost jobs or wages because their unionized employers lost  business.  That harm, moreover, is even more indirect than the already indirect injury to its members, yet a number of decisions  have denied standing to employees with merely derivative injuries.  See,  e. g.,  Pitchford v. PEPI, Inc., 531 F.2d 92, 97  (CA3),  cert. denied,  426 U.S. 935 (1976) ;  Contreras v.

Without evidence that petitioners are using market power to force Roux upon patients there is no basis to view the arrangement  as unreasonably restraining competition whatever the reasons for its creation.

Fortner I, 394 U.S., at 513  (WHITE, J., dissenting).  Insurance companies are the principal source of price restraint  in the hospital industry; they place some limitations on the ability of hospitals to exploit their market power.  Through this  arrangement, petitioners may be able to evade that restraint by obtaining a portion of the anesthesiologists' fees and therefore  realize a greater return than they could in the absence of the arrangement.  This could also have an adverse effect on the  anesthesiology market since it is possible that only less able anesthesiologists would be willing to give up part of their fees in  return for the security of an exclusive contract. However, there are no findings of either the District Court or the Court of Appeals  which indicate that this type of exploitation of market power has occurred here.  The Court of Appeals found only that Roux's use  of nurse anesthetists increased its and the hospital's profits, but there was no finding that nurse anesthetists might not be used  with equal frequency absent the exclusive contract. Indeed, the District Court found that nurse anesthetists are utilized in all  hospitals in the area.   513 F.Supp., at 537, 543 .

It is possible  that under some circumstances an exclusive contract could raise entry barriers since anesthesiologists could not compete for  the contract without raising the capital necessary to run a hospitalwide operation.

(Emphasis supplied.) The dissent is  inaccurate.  Our holding is based on the court's direct participation in every stage of the admissions process, including retention  of the sole authority to admit or deny.  The critical action in this case was the court's decision to deny Ronwin admission to the  Bar.  The dissent's suggestion that the Arizona Supreme Court never made this decision simply ignores Arizona law.  The  Arizona Supreme Court has stated on several occasions that it, and not the Committee, makes the decision to admit or deny  admission to applicants.

1286 ,"34  The The  amicus curiae  brief of the National Conference of Bar Examiners points out that many States have bar admission  processes like those at issue in this case.  See Brief for National Conference of Bar Examiners as  Amicus Curiae  1, 2, 8.   Typically, the state supreme court is the ultimate decisionmaker and a committee or board conducts the examinations pursuant  to court rules.  It is customary for lawyers of recognized standing and integrity to serve on these bodies, usually as a public duty  and with little or no compensation.  See S. Duhl, The Bar Examiner's Handbook 95, 99 (2d ed. 1980).  In virtually all States, a  significant percentage of those who take the bar examination fail to pass.  See 1982 Bar Examination Statistics, 52 Bar  Examiner 24-26 (1983).  Thus, every year, there are thousands of aspirants who, like Ronwin, are disappointed.  For example, in  1974 (the year Ronwin first took the Arizona bar examination), of the 43,798 applicants who took bar examinations nationwide,  10,440 failed to pass.  44 Bar Examiner 115 (1975).  The National Conference of Bar Examiners, in its  amicus  brief, cautions  that affirmance of the Court of Appeals in this case could well invite numerous suits.  It is no answer to say that, of course, such  suits are likely to be frivolous.  Ronwin, who failed the bar in 1974, has been litigating his claim for a decade on the basis of a  complaint that basically challenges the  motive  of the Arizona Committee.  His claim is that the grading formula was devised for  the purpose of limiting competition.  If such an allegation is sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss, examining boards and  committees would have to bear the substantial ""discovery and litigation burdens"" attendant particularly upon refuting a charge of  improper motive.  See Areeda, Antitrust Immunity for ""State Action"" after  Lafayette , 95 Harv. L. Rev. 435, 451 (1981). Moreover,  Ronwin has brought a suit for damages under the Sherman Act, with the threat of treble damages.  There can be no question  that the threat of being sued for damages -- particularly where the issue turns on subjective intent or motive -- will deter ""able  citizens"" from performing this essential public service.  See  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 814 (1982) . In our view, as the  action challenged by Ronwin was that of the State, the motive of the Committee in its recommendations to the court was  immaterial.  We nevertheless think, particularly in view of the decision below, that the consequences of an affirmance should be  understood.  The consequences of reversal by the Court today will have only a limited effect.  Our attention has not been drawn  to any trade or other profession in which the licensing of its members is determined directly by the sovereign itself -- here the  State Supreme Court."

Even if it were the case that the Arizona Supreme Court reviewed petitioner's complaint on its merits, all that would  indicate is that the court has declined to exercise its power of revision with respect to petitioners' alleged anticompetitive policies.

Followed by the Seventh Circuit below as well as by other Courts of  Appeals, this test sets forth various criteria for evaluating whether a given parent and subsidiary are capable of conspiring with  each other.  See n. 2,  supra ; see generally  Ogilvie v. Fotomat Corp., 641 F.2d 581 (CA8 1981) ;  Las Vegas Sun, Inc . v.

These criteria measure the ""separateness"" of the subsidiary: whether it has separate  control of its day-to-day operations, separate officers, separate corporate headquarters, and so forth.  At least when a subsidiary  is wholly owned, however, these factors are not sufficient to describe a separate economic entity for purposes of the Sherman  Act. The factors simply describe the manner in which the parent chooses to structure a subunit of itself.  They cannot overcome  the basic fact that the ultimate interests of the subsidiary and the parent are identical, so the parent and the subsidiary must be  viewed as a single economic unit."

International Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 141 (1968) .

That is true, but it is also true of any  ordinary commercial contract between separate entities, as can be seen if one substitutes the word ""contract"" for ""conspiracy"" in  the passage I have quoted.  The language of the Sherman Act indicates that it treats ""contracts"" and ""conspiracies"" as  equivalent concepts -- both satisfy the multiplicity-of-actors requirement -- and yet one of the most fundamental points in antitrust  jurisprudence, dating at least to  Standard Oil , is that there is nothing inherently anticompetitive about a contract.  Similarly, an  agreement to act ""for common benefit"" in itself is unremarkable -- all agreements are in some sense a restraint of trade be they  contracts or conspiracies.

If that were the case, incorporated subsidiaries would never be used to achieve integration -- the ready availability of an  unincorporated alternative would always be employed in order to avoid antitrust liability.

It arbitrarily It is worth bearing in mind that the holding of the court below is not without problematic consequences of its own.  It arbitrarily  restricts the availability of private actions, for lawbreakers are often not apprehended and convicted. Even if a conviction has  been obtained, it is unlikely that a private plaintiff will be able to recover for all of the acts constituting an extensive ""pattern,"" or  that multiple victims will all be able to obtain redress.  This is because criminal convictions are often limited to a small portion of  the actual or possible charges.  The decision below would also create peculiar incentives for plea bargaining to non-predicate- act offenses so as to ensure immunity from a later civil suit.  If nothing else, a criminal defendant might plead to a tiny fraction of  counts, so as to limit future civil liability.  In addition, the dependence of potential civil litigants on the initiation and success of a  criminal prosecution could lead to unhealthy private pressures on prosecutors and to self-serving trial testimony, or at least  accusations thereof.  Problems would also arise if some or all of the convictions were reversed on appeal.  Finally, the  compelled wait for the completion of criminal proceedings would result in pursuit of stale claims, complex statute of limitations  problems, or the wasteful splitting of actions, with resultant claim and issue preclusion complications."

Again, we have  doubts about the premise of this rather convoluted argument.  The strict-construction principle is merely a guide to statutory  interpretation.

The implication is that while two acts are necessary, they may not be sufficient.  Indeed, in common  parlance two of anything do not generally form a ""pattern."" The legislative history supports the view that two isolated acts of  racketeering activity do not constitute a pattern.  As the Senate Report explained: ""The target of [RICO] is thus not sporadic  activity.  The infiltration of legitimate business normally requires more than one 'racketeering activity' and the threat of continuing  activity to be effective.  It is this factor of  continuity plus relationship  which combines to produce a pattern."" S. Rep. No. 91-617,  p. 158 (1969) (emphasis added).  Similarly, the sponsor of the Senate bill, after quoting this portion of the Report, pointed out to  his colleagues that ""[the] term 'pattern' itself requires the showing of a relationship . . . .

Similarly, in  Simpson v.

Both  Simpson  and  Kiefer-Stewart  were premised on a recognition that the purposes of the antitrust laws are best served by insuring  that the private action will be an ever-present threat to deter anyone contemplating business behavior in violation of the antitrust  laws. The plaintiff who reaps the reward of treble damages may be no less morally reprehensible than the defendant, but the law  encourages his suit to further the overriding public policy in favor of competition.  A more fastidious regard for the relative moral  worth of the parties would only result in seriously undermining the usefulness of the private action as a bulwark of antitrust  enforcement.

The relevant study is not based on actual cost data; rather, it consists of expert opinion based on a  mathematical construction that in turn rests on assumptions about petitioners' costs.  The District Court analyzed those  assumptions in some detail and found them both implausible and inconsistent with record evidence.   Zenith Radio Corp . v.

Although the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's finding  that the expert report was inadmissible, the court did not disturb the District Court's analysis of the factors that substantially  undermine the probative value of that evidence.  See  723 F.2d, at 277-282 . We find the District Court's analysis persuasive.

But this effect is irrelevant to a conspiracy to price predatorily.  Petitioners have no incentive to  underprice each other if they already are pricing  below  the level at which they could sell their goods.  The far more plausible  inference from a customer allocation agreement such as the five company rule is that petitioners were conspiring to  raise  prices,  by limiting their ability to take sales away from each other.  Respondents -- petitioners' competitors -- suffer no harm from a  conspiracy to raise prices.   Supra, at 582-583 .  Moreover, it seems very unlikely that the five company rule had any significant  effect of any kind, since the ""rule"" permitted petitioners to sell to their American subsidiaries, and did not limit the number of  distributors to which the subsidiaries could resell.   513 F.Supp., at 1190 ."

In order to protect against multiple lawsuits and duplicative recoveries, courts should examine  other factors in addition to antitrust injury, such as the potential for duplicative recovery, the complexity of apportioning damages,  and the existence of other parties that have been more directly harmed, to determine whether a party is a proper plaintiff under §  4.

For purposes of decision in  Matsushita Electric Industrial Co . v.  Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574 (1986) , for example,  we defined predatory pricing as either ""(i) pricing below the level necessary to sell their products, or (ii) pricing below some  appropriate measure of cost.""

1597 ,"15  Even had Monfort actually advanced a claim of predatory pricing, we doubt whether the facts as found by the District Court Even had Monfort actually advanced a claim of predatory pricing, we doubt whether the facts as found by the District Court  would have supported it.  Although Excel may have had the financial resources to absorb losses over an extended period, other  factors, such as Excel's share of market capacity and the barriers to entry after competitors have been driven from the market,  must also be considered. In order to succeed in a sustained campaign of predatory pricing, a predator must be able to absorb  the market shares of its rivals once prices have been cut.  If it cannot do so, its attempt at predation will presumably fail, because  there will remain in the market sufficient demand for the competitors' goods at a higher price, and the competitors will not be  driven out of business.  In this case, Excel's 20.4% market share after the merger suggests it would lack sufficient market power  to engage in predatory pricing. See Williamson, Predatory Pricing: A Strategic and Welfare Analysis, 87 Yale L. J. 284, 292  (1977) (60% share necessary); Areeda & Turner, Williamson on Predatory Pricing, 87 Yale L. J. 1337, 1348 (1978) (60% share  not enough).  It is possible that a firm with a low market share might nevertheless have sufficient excess capacity to enable it  rapidly to expand its output and absorb the market shares of its rivals. According to Monfort's expert witness, however, Excel's  postmerger share of market capacity would be only 28.4%.  1 App. 66.  Moreover, it appears that Excel, like the other large beef  packers, operates at over 85% of capacity.   Id ., at 135-136.  Thus Excel acting alone would clearly lack sufficient capacity after  the merger to satisfy all or most of the demand for boxed beef. Although it is conceivable that Excel could act collusively with  other large packers, such as IBP, in order to make the scheme work, the District Court found that Monfort did not ""assert that  Excel and IBP would act in collusion with each other in an effort to drive others out of the market,""  591 F.Supp., at 692 . With only  a 28.4% share of market capacity and lacking a plan to collude, Excel would harm only itself by embarking on a sustained  campaign of predatory pricing. Courts should not find allegations of predatory pricing credible when the alleged predator is  incapable of successfully pursuing a predatory scheme.  See n. 17,  infra ."

As we discussed in Claims of threatened injury from predatory pricing must, of course, be evaluated with care.  As we discussed in  Matsushita  Electric Industrial Co . v.  Zenith Radio Corp ., the likelihood that predatory pricing will benefit the predator is ""inherently uncertain:  the short-run loss [from pricing below cost] is definite, but the long-run gain depends on successfully neutralizing the  competition. . . . [and] on maintaining monopoly power for long enough both to recoup the predator's losses and to harvest some  additional gain.""  475 U.S., at 589 . Although the commentators disagree as to whether it is ever rational for a firm to engage in  such conduct, it is plain that the obstacles to the successful execution of a strategy of predation are manifold, and that the  disincentives to engage in such a strategy are accordingly numerous.  See,  e. g.,  id., at 588-593  (discussing obstacles to  successful predatory pricing conspiracy); R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 144-159 (1978); McGee, Predatory Pricing Revisited,  23 J.

As  we stated in  Matsushita , ""predatory pricing schemes are rarely tried, and even more rarely successful.""  475 U.S., at 589 .  Moreover, the mechanism by which a firm engages in predatory pricing -- lowering prices -- is the same mechanism by which a  firm stimulates competition; because ""cutting prices in order to increase business often is the very essence of competition . . .

However, in its zeal to narrow antitrust injury, the Court assumes that all vertical maximum-price- fixing arrangements mimic the circumstances present or discussed in Albrecht, in which there was monopoly power at both the  production and exclusive distributorship stages.  This approach is incorrect.  For example, in Albrecht itself the Court identified  possible injury to consumers as one basis for its per se rule, even though there was no evidence of actual consumer injury in  that case.   390 U.S., at 152-153 . Furthermore, the Albrecht Court did not treat Albrecht himself as a ""dealer"" in the conspiracy,  but essentially as a ""competitor"" targeted by the price-fixing conspiracy between Herald Company and the new dealers that were  hired ""to force petitioner to conform to the advertised retail price"" by selling newspapers in his territory at lower, fixed prices.   Id.,  at 149-150 , and n. 6. Although Albrecht was a potential Herald dealer -- and thus not strictly a ""dealer"" or a ""competitor"" in the  Court's use of those terms -- what is critical is that he had standing to bring a  § 1  action as the victim of a vertical conspiracy to  underprice his sales.

In other words, the discount was not consumed or absorbed at the level of the  favored buyers; rather, the amount of the discount (or a significant portion) appeared in the favored purchasers' retail price, or in  the favored purchasers' price to their customers and in their customers' retail prices. Under such circumstances, the otherwise  innocuous nature and presumed legality of functional discounts is rebutted, for it is universally recognized that a functional  discount remains legal only to the extent it acts as compensation for the functions performed by the favored buyer.

Unlike  Continental T. V. , this case  does not concern vertical relationships between parties on different levels of the same distribution chain. In the relevant market,  service, Kodak and the ISO's are direct competitors; their relationship is horizontal. The interbrand competition at issue here is  competition over the provision of service.

Ct. 2430 (1983) , the antitrust defendant's alleged violations of several provisions of the Sherman and Clayton Acts  included much more than the filing of a single lawsuit; they encompassed a broad scheme of monopolizing the entire relevant  market by: purchasing patents; threatening to file many other, patently groundless lawsuits; acquiring a competitor; dividing  markets; and filing a fraudulent patent application. In  In re Burlington Northern, Inc., 822 F.2d 518 (CA5 1987) , cert. denied,  484  U.S. 1007 (1988) , the plaintiffs alleged, and produced evidence to support their theory, that the defendant had filed suit solely to  cause them a delay of crippling expense, and the defendants had either brought or unsuccessfully defended a succession of  related lawsuits involving plaintiff's right to compete. In both of these cases the Courts of Appeals ably attempted to balance  strict enforcement of the antitrust laws with possible abuses of the judicial process. That they permitted some reliance on  subjective motivation -- as even we have done in cases alleging abuse of judicial process, see  California Motor Transport Co. v.  Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 513-518, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642, 92 S. Ct. 609 (1972)  -- is neither surprising nor relevant in a case  involving no such allegations."
