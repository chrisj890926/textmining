21,1, All statutory references are to this code unless otherwise stated. 
23,2," The jury was instructed about the elements of the Plaintiffs' antitrust cause of action as follows: ""In order to win against a 
defendant on their price-fixing claim, plaintiffs shall prove as to that defendant each of the following elements by a 
preponderance of the evidence: First, that the defendant entered into an agreement or conspiracy with one or more of the other 
defendants to fix the price of eggs; second, that the defendant knowingly, that is voluntarily and intentionally, became a party to 
the agreement; and third, that the agreement caused plaintiffs to suffer economic damage and the dollar value of any such 
damage."" "
25,3," Although Plaintiffs suggest in passing that there may have been only an 8-4 verdict in favor of Ralphs in particular, Plaintiffs did 
not take any corrective action in the trial court, and have waived this argument. The record suggests that the reporter erred in 
transcribing the vote as to Ralphs, because the verdict form records a 9-3 vote as to each grocer, including Ralphs. "
32,1, All statutory references are to this code unless otherwise stated. 
34,2," The jury was instructed about the elements of the Plaintiffs' antitrust cause of action as follows: ""In order to win against a 
defendant on their price-fixing claim, plaintiffs shall prove as to that defendant each of the following elements by a 
preponderance of the evidence: First, that the defendant entered into an agreement or conspiracy with one or more of the other 
defendants to fix the price of eggs; second, that the defendant knowingly, that is voluntarily and intentionally, became a party to

36,3," Although Plaintiffs suggest in passing that there may have been only an 8-4 verdict in favor of Ralphs in particular, Plaintiffs did 
not take any corrective action in the trial court, and have waived this argument. The record suggests that the reporter erred in 
transcribing the vote as to Ralphs, because the verdict form records a 9-3 vote as to each grocer, including Ralphs. "
46,1, Plaintiff has subsequently filed an eleventh lawsuit. 
47,2," Defendant BMMI has also moved to dismissed based on sovereign immunity. Finding that dismissal of all defendants is 
warranted on the grounds detailed below, the Court has not addressed this argument. "
49,3," Defendants had originally speculated that plaintiff was suing under this section. In their reply, they oddly conclude that the 
opposition brief suggests he is alleging a violation of 15 U.S.C. § 1. This is probably a typographical error because the reply 
goes on to address a section 2 claim substantively. Regardless, defendant's complaint would fail as a matter of law under either 
section."
49,4," In his opposition McMahon states that: ""It is a well known fact that since Pier 39 with it's Blue and Gold Fleet was allowed to 
buy the Red and White fleet, their stranglehold on the tourist trade market is one hundred percent and as such, represents a 
complete monopoly."" This statement is difficult to make sense of. As defendant's point out, the Blue & Gold Fleet purchase of 
Red & White happened in 1997--five years after McMahon was allegedly ousted from his berth. Furthermore there is absolutely 
no allegation regarding the relationship between Blue & Gold or Red & White and any of the named defendants. Finally there is 
no allegation that the Blue & Gold and Red & White combination was in any way furthered or encouraged by a named 
defendant. "
53,1," Pursuant to the court's order, dated November 8, 2001, unsealing this memorandum and order, the court hereby re-issues this 
order, originally filed under seal on August 16, 2001, in redacted form. The redactions are indicated herein by dash marks, and 
appear at pages 22:21 and 25:2-4."
53,3," The facts recited herein are taken from the parties' briefs and evidence submitted in conjunction with the pending motions. 
Where disputed, PSI's version of the facts are taken as true. The court overrules Sematech's objection to PSI's ""Statement of 
Undisputed Facts in Opposition to Sematech's Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the Alternative, Summary Adjudication,"" 
filed June 8, 2001. While PSI labeled the document a ""Statement of Undisputed Facts,"" it is actually a statement of ""disputed"" 
facts which is properly filed in opposition to a motion for summary judgment. E.D. Cal. L.R. 56-260(b)."
53,4," The court overrules Sematech's objection, filed June 8, 2001, to the Morris Declaration. Said declaration does not purport to 
offer ""expert testimony,"" either technical, economic, legal, or otherwise. Rather, it offers the lay opinion testimony of Mr. Morris 
based on his experience in the test wafer market; said testimony is properly considered. Alternatively, there are facts stated in 
the declaration which support that Mr. Morris may be qualified to testify as to some expert opinions. Additionally, the court does 
not rely on any portions of Mr. Morris' declaration which are argumentative or without foundation. "
54,5," The present members of Sematech are: IBM, Intel, Motorola, Hewlett Packard, Advanced Microdevices, Texas Instruments, 
Phillips, TSMC, ST Microelectronics, Infinion Technology, Hynix, Conextent, and Agere Systems. See Pl.'s Opp'n to Def.'s MSJ, 
filed June 1, 2001 subject to protective order (""Opp'n to MSJ""), at 3 n. 4."
54,6," 15 U.S.C. § 4601 reads in relevant part: (a) Findings The Congress finds that it is in the national economic and security  [*5] interests of the United States for the Department of 
Defense to provide financial assistance to the industry consortium known as Sematech for research and development 
activities in the field of semiconductor manufacturing technology. (b) Purposes The purposes of this subchapter are- (1) to encourage the semiconductor industry in the United States- (A) to conduct research on advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques; and (B) to develop techniques to use manufacturing expertise for the manufacture of a variety of semiconductor products; 
and (2) in order to achieve the purpose set out in paragraph (1), to provide a grant program for the financial support of 
semiconductor research activities conducted by Sematech."
54,15, U.S.C. § 4601 (a) & (b). 
55,7," The court overrules Sematech's objection, filed June 8, 2001, to the Brown Declaration. Said declaration properly authenticates 
the attached exhibits, the majority of which were authenticated at deposition."
55,8," PSI's claims do not involve the production of ""new"" semiconductor products by Sematech, i.e., so called ""cutting edge"" test 
wafers. Rather, its claims only involve test wafers which PSI and other private competitors could have made with commercially 
available equipment which they owned or which they could and would have acquired but for Sematech's participation in the 
market."
55,9," Responding to a similar complaint by another test wafer company, Tactical Fabs, Inc., Sematach's Chris Sallee wrote, ""[U]nder 
SEMATECH's operating documents, we are legally prohibited from commercially selling semiconductor products solely for 
revenue."" Brown Decl. re: MSJ, Ex. 666. "
58,10," For the sake of brevity, the court omits from this discussion the extensive bickering contained in the parties' briefs as to who 
said  [*20] what, and when. "
60,11," Cost Mgmt. Serv., Inc. v. Washington Natural Gas Co., 99 F.3d 937, 953 (9th Cir. 1996), relied on by Sematech, does not hold 
to the contrary. While the court in Cost Mgmt. reached a different result from the courts in Farley and Western Concrete, it did 
not prohibit a finding of ""predatory"" conduct based on a violation of law extrinsic to the antitrust laws. Rather, the court did not 
follow the holdings in Farley and Western Concrete because in Cost Mgmt., the plaintiff was not itself subject to the governing 
tariff. As will be explained infra, here, PSI asserts violations of law which are applicable to both PSI and Sematech, and thus, the 
 [*26] distinction drawn in Cost Mgmt. is not applicable. Moreover, the court notes the limited applicability of all three cases. The 
rationale for the decisions in Farley, Western Concrete, and Cost Mgmt. was based on the courts' findings that the facts in those 
cases presented claims closely analogous to traditional predatory pricing claims. Here, predatory pricing is not at issue. 
Therefore, the cases are not factually on point; however, the court relies on them in so far as they stand for the general 
proposition that a Section 2 violation may be shown by evidence of violation of laws extrinsic to the antitrust laws."
60,12," Such claim requires that the court address whether the asserted predicate offenses are ""forbidden by law."" Stop Youth 
Addiction, Inc. v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 17 Cal. 4th 553, 560, 71 Cal. Rptr. 2d 731, 950 P.2d 1086 (1998). "
61,13," It is Ms. Eggleston's expert opinion that (1) Sematech lost its tax-exempt status in 1996 when its mission changed from 
assisting the industry to assisting its member corporations; (2) Sematech's test wafer business constituted an ""unrelated trade or 
business activity"" which generated income which should have been (but was not) reported by Sematech and subjected to 
taxation; and (3) Sematech has failed to disclose on IRS Form 990 the existence of its commercial test  [*30] wafer business. "
62,14," Sematech's expert, David Teece, disputes many of the findings made by PSI's expert, Alan Cox, set forth above. On a motion 
for summary judgment, the court cannot weigh the evidence presented by the parties. Here, the conflicting expert reports 
demonstrate that triable issues of fact remain for a jury. See Avery Dennison Corp. v. Acco Brands, Inc., 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
3938, 2000 WL 986995, *12 (C.D. Cal. 2000) (""In light of the [c]onflicting evidence and  [*33] expert opinions, this Court may not 
weigh the evidence as presented by the parties. The inferences to be drawn from the parties' evidence could weigh in favor of 
either party."")"
62,15," In Rebel Oil, the court stated that the ""main sources of entry barriers are: (1) legal license requirements; (2) control of an 
essential or superior resource; (3) entrenched buyer preferences for established brands; (4) capital market evaluations imposing 
higher capitol costs on new entrants; and . . . (5) economies of scale."" 51 F. 3d at 1439. "
65,16," The court rejects Sematech's ""judicial abstention"" argument as inapposite. The cases cited by Sematech each involve a 
highly-regulated industry (i.e., the insurance industry) and/or plaintiff had an alternative remedy that was either available or 
mandatory. See Def.'s MSJ at 32-34. In this case, the test wafer industry is not regulated whatsoever, and PSI has no other 
forum to redress its damages; accordingly, this court will decide the matter."
65,17," PSI conceded in its opposition that it does not have a UCL claim based on the NCRPA since the Act does not prohibit any 
conduct by Sematech. See Opp'n to MSJ at 37:20-22. The NCRPA simply confers certain benefits on research and production 
ventures that satisfy its terms, including a relaxed antitrust standard and single (not treble) damages if their activities are 
challenged under the antitrust laws. "
66,18," Norwest Mortgage, Inc. v. Sup. Ct., 72 Cal. App. 4th 214, 85 Cal. Rptr. 2d 18 (1999),  [*48] relied on by Sematech, does not 
require a contrary holding. There, the question presented was whether a UCL action could be granted nationwide class 
certification when some of the actions complained of were performed out of state and effected out of state plaintiffs with no 
nexus to California. The court held that with respect to these claims only, the lack of any nexus to California made it 
inappropriate to apply the UCL. The court did not decide whether an out-of-state law could serve as a predicate for a UCL claim 
because no out-of-state laws were involved."
66,19," Moreover, since this lawsuit was filed, Sematech amended its Certificate of Incorporation to state that the term ""semiconductor 
products"" means only finished chips. Falstad Aff., Ex. 3. While Sematech contends that the amendment was only a ""clarification"" 
of its charter, the trier of fact could treat the amendment as an admission that Sematech's sales of test wafers before the 
amendment were in violation of its charter. "
67,20," Section 3730(e)(4)(A) provides, ""No court shall have jurisdiction over an action . . . based upon the public disclosure of 
allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government 
Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, unless the action is brought by the Attorney 
General or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information."" "
68,21," Mr. James Wilson was designated by UT as the person most knowledgeable about the lease between UT and Sematech and 
about Sematech's disclosures to UT about its test wafer business. "
69,22," After the hearing on Sematech's motions, the court permitted the parties to simultaneously file supplemental briefs to further 
address the issues raised at the hearing. The ""fraud"" prong of the UCL was not discussed at the hearing."
69,23," Sematech cites the Stutz case, which addresses whether the ""discovery rule"" applies to unfair competition claims. Stutz Motor 
Car of Am., Inc., v. Reebok Int'l, Ltd., 909 F. Supp. 1353, 1363-64 (9th Cir. 1995). Stutz does not rule upon whether the 
""continuing violations"" doctrine applies to unfair competition claims. Moreover, although the Ninth Circuit has not directly decided "
70,," this question, recent Ninth Circuit decisions have generously applied this equitable doctrine in many other contexts. In fact, at 
least one California district court has directly applied the continuing violations doctrine to an unfair competition claim. See Suh, 
987 F. Supp. at 796; see also Draper v. Coeur Rochester, Inc., 147 F.3d 1104, 1107 (9th Cir. 1998) (court applied the continuing 
violations doctrine to a Title VII claim); see also Gutowsky v. County of Placer, 108 F.3d 256, 259 (9th Cir. 1997) (court applied 
the continuing violations doctrine 3 to a § 1983 action). "
71,24," Korea Supply is the first California case to squarely address the issue presented by this motion. The cases cited by both 
parties, though instructive of the issue generally, do not directly address the question presented here. See, e.g., Cortez v. 
Purolator Air Filtration Products Co., 23 Cal. 4th 163, 176, 96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 518, 999 P.2d 706 (2000) (the court expressly stated 
that it did not consider whether an award of back wages would be proper under a ""disgorgement of benefit theory""). "
72,25," Section 17203 states in relevant part, The court may make such orders . . . as may be necessary to prevent the use or employment by any person of any practice 
which constitutes unfair competition, . . . or as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any money or property, 
real or personal, which may have been acquired by means of such unfair competition. Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17203 (emphasis added)."
72,26," In its reply, Sematech argues that should the court decide that PSI may proceed under the UCL pursuant to a ""disgorgement 
of benefits"" theory, it nonetheless seeks an order that PSI is not entitled to ""retitution"" under the UCL. See Def.'s Reply on Mot. 
for Sum. Adjud., filed under seal June 8, 2001, at 8:4-11. The court  [*71] declines to make such a bright-line order. The relevant 
cases discuss ""disgorgement of profits"" as a form of ""retitutionary"" relief. See, e.g., ABC Int'l Traders, Inc. v. Matsushita Elec. 
Corp. of Am., 14 Cal. 4th 1247, 1268, 61 Cal. Rptr. 2d 112, 931 P.2d 290 (1997) (""on its face, section 17203 authorized 
injunctive relief to prevent unfair competition and/or restitution (i.e., disgorgement) of money or property wrongfully obtained""). 
Although this may not be technically true in some instances, the California Supreme Court recognized in Kraus that ""an order 
that a defendant disgorge money obtained through an unfair practice may include a restitutionary element, but is not so limited."" 
23 Cal. 4th at 127. Thus, some disgorgement orders may also classify as ""restitution"" orders, and it is not necessary to make a 
distinction between the two theories of recovery when plaintiff is entitled to either type of relief under the UCL. Moreover, it is 
worth noting that PSI has expressly stated that it is not seeking ""restitution"" as that term is defined by Sematech but rather seeks 
relief under the UCL under a ""disgorgement of benefits"" theory. See Pl.'s Opp'n to Mot. for Sum. Adjud., filed June 1, 2001 
subject to protective order  [*72] (""Opp'n re: Sum. Adjud.""), at 6:4-6."
72,27," PSI only seeks to disgorge ""that portion of Sematech's illicit profits that are proportionate to PSI's share of the test wafer 
market,"" had Sematech not engaged in unfair competition. See Opp'n re: Sum. Adjud. at 8:16-19. "
77,1," See  Advest, Inc. v. McCarthy, 914 F.2d 6, 8-9 (1st Cir. 1990); Societe Generale de Surveillance, S.A. v. Raytheon Eur. Mgmt. 
& Sys. Co., 643 F.2d 863, 867-68 (1st Cir. 1981); see also 4 MacNeil, Speidel & Stipanowich, Federal Arbitration Law § 40.5 
(1999); 2 id. § 23.5."
77,2," In some situations, a supplier like DaimlerChrysler may lawfully impose such restrictions (e.g., granting exclusive territories) to 
protect dealer services against ""free riding"" or to promote dealer investment, Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 
U.S. 36, 54-55, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977); but here DaimlerChrysler seeks to expand dealer competition. "
78,3," In Page v. Moseley, Hallgarten, Estabrook & Weeden, Inc., 806 F.2d 291 (1st Cir. 1986), this court stated that the Supreme 
Court's decision in Mitsubishi did not overrule the American Safety doctrine where the context was domestic rather than 
international, and on this basis, Page held that civil RICO claims were not arbitrable. Id. at 299. But Page's holding was itself 
abrogated by the Supreme Court in Shearson/American Express, 482 U.S. at 225. "
84,1," Defendants American Cyanamid Co., Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. and Biochimica Opos, S.p.A. (""Opos"") are no longer a part of 
this case."
84,2," Count II of the Amended Counterclaim alleges unfair competition under New Jersey common law. Lilly asks for summary 
judgment on this counterclaim. In its briefs, Zenith does not respond to Lilly's arguments concerning unfair competition. On this 
issue, Lilly is entitled to summary judgment."
84,3," A ruling on the summary judgment motions has been patiently awaited by the parties. The Court takes this opportunity to list 
the briefings submitted on these motions: (1) Lilly's Memorandum in Support of Lilly's Motion for Summary Judgment; (2) Zenith's Memorandum in Support of Zenith's Motion for Summary Judgment; (3) Lilly's Memorandum in Opposition to Zenith's Motion for Summary Judgment; (4) Zenith's Memorandum in Opposition to Lilly's Motion for Summary Judgment; (5) Lilly's Reply in Support of Lilly's Motion for Summary Judgment; (6) Zenith's Reply to Lilly's Memorandum in Opposition to Zenith's Motion for Summary Judgment; (7) Lilly's Surreply Memorandum in Opposition to Zenith's Motion for Summary Judgment; (8) Zenith's Surreply to Lilly's Reply Memorandum in Support of Lilly's Motion for Summary Judgment; (9) Zenith's Notice of Supplemental Authority Reversing Case Upon Which Lilly Relied for the Summary Judgment Motions; (10) Lilly's Response to Zenith's Notice of Supplemental Authority; (11) Zenith's Supplement to Zenith's Surreply in Opposition to Lilly's Motion for Summary Judgment; (12) Lilly's Response to Zenith's Supplemental Surreply Memorandum; (13) Zenith's Motion to Strike Lilly's Response to Zenith's Supplemental Surreply; (14) Lilly's Motion in Opposition to Zenith's Motion to Strike Lilly's Response to Zenith's Supplemental Surreply; (15) Zenith's Reply to Lilly's Response to Zenith's Supplemental Surreply (!), (filed May 18, 2001); (16) Lilly's Response to Zenith's Filing of May 18, 2001; and last, and almost certainly least-- (17) Zenith's Reply to Lilly's Response of May 30, 2001. Note that this list does not include the more than 15 appendices or the more than ten statements of material ""facts"" filed in 
conjunction with these motions. Perhaps the parties would have needed less patience if they had pared down the briefing on "
85,," these motions. Filings 11-17 seemed to us to be especially superfluous. While we assure the parties that all the briefs were read 
and carefully considered, an attentive reading of this order will reveal that their latter filings are not cited, suggesting that they did 
not aid either party's cause. In candor, we have been left exhausted and nearly speechless by the parties' wholesale abuse of 
Local Rule 56.1."
85,4," The manufacture of the antibiotic cefaclor is a multi-step process, although the exact number of steps depends on the 
manufacturer and the process used. For our purposes, certain compounds are important. Bulk cefaclor is converted from the 
cefaclor nucleus (or ""7 ACCA"" or ""3-chloro-7 amino cephem ester"" or ""7-amino"") into dosage form for medical use. The term 
""zwitterion nucleus"" refers to the cefaclor nucleus made by another company discussed later. Exomethylene and enol are 
compounds used to make the cefaclor nucleus."
85,5," Zenith has asked us to reconsider this ruling or to certify it for interlocutory appeal. That motion is ruled on in an accompanying 
entry. "
87,6," Zenith maintains that the effective date of the amendment is reflected in a notation on its first page, saying ""6/27/90 - Revised 
4/16/91."" Zenith's Resp. to Lilly's Stm. of Additional Facts, P 217. Lilly cites the deposition testimony of Thomas Pytynia, then 
General Counsel for Lilly International Corporation, as support for the position that the beginning date of the revised MSA was 
sometime after May of 1991. Lilly's Stm. of Additional Facts, P 217 (citing Pytynia Dep. at 17). In its surreply, Lilly states that ""the 
record appears to indicate that it was not executed until June,"" but cites no particular part of the record for this proposition. 
Neither party adequately explains why the start date for the contract set forth in the terms of the contract itself should not be 
accepted as the definitive answer on the subject. "
88,7," InterChem Corporation (""InterChem""), of Paramus, New Jersey, is Dobfar's agent for the sale of pharmaceutical products in the 
United States. Ronald S. Manino is the chairman of InterChem."
88,8," The Court notes the near-absurdity of needing more than three pages of briefing, not including reply briefing, to explain how 
this writing is ""direct"" evidence of a horizontal conspiracy. "
89,9," This type of arrangement, where one party owns the input and the output of a manufacturing process undertaken by another 
party, is referred to as ""toll manufacturing."""
89,10," In support of the interpretation that follows from reading the excerpt in its context, Lilly submitted the affidavit of Joe Hunt. In 
that affidavit, Hunt explains that ""during my December 1990 visit, I clarified that Lilly would purchase cefaclor nucleus directly 
from ACS Dobfar, and not through InterChem. . . . and memorialized this agreement in an email message."" Hunt Aff., PP 4-5. 
Zenith objects to the use of the affidavit to clarify either the email or Mr. Hunt's deposition testimony. Zenith Reply at 19-20. 
Zenith's objection is unavailing. As we determined above, Zenith's reading of the email is an impermissible and unreasonable 
inference based on the document itself. Mr. Hunt's affidavit is not a necessary clarification. "
90,11," The evidence on this point is equivocal. Zenith cites a January 13, 1994 memo from J. Greg Davis at Lilly to Eagle, Foglesong, 
Voris, and others in which Davis writes: Patrick Fourteau is holding on-going negotiations with Marco Falciani, president of ACS-Dobfar, for the purchase of 7-
ACCA or cefaclor. Marco has expressed interest in purchasing 5-10 tons annually for final sale into select eastern 
European markets and/or China. Negotiations are proceeding slowly as Patrick and others fear that sales to Marco might 
cannibalize Lilly sales. Negotiations are centered around a sales price of $ 1,200 per kilo, which leaves Marco with little or 
no margin. No volumes (beyond 2 tons scheduled for sale in 1994) have been committed to Marco at this time. Zenith Ex. 166. The memo mentions neither when negotiations began nor Ranbaxy. As Lilly notes, the actual sale of Ranbaxy-
produced nucleus to Dobfar did not take place until after December 1993. Wise Aff., P 7. "
91,12," Zenith makes a few similar proffers of ""direct"" evidence. We will not discuss them here, other than to note that we find their 
interpretations of the documents similarly convoluted and unpersuasive. "
92,13," Lorabid is the brand name of the antibiotic, loracarbef, which Lilly developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Lilly's Stm. of 
Facts, PP 13-16."
92,14," On this basis, Lilly also argues that the per se rule, which we address later, does not apply. Specifically, Lilly cites Polk Bros., 
Inc. v. Forest City Enterprises, Inc., 776 F.2d 185, 188-89 (7th Cir. 1985) for the proposition that its arrangement with Dobfar 
was ""ancillary""--part of larger procompetitive endeavor that the agreement promotes--at the time of its adoption. Lilly Memo. at 6-
7. According to Lilly, Lilly needed outside production of bulk cefaclor so that it could focus its resources on Lorabid production, 
but, at that time, no company, including Dobfar, could produce bulk cefaclor without using Lilly technology and material. The 
restrictions in the MSAs were necessary, goes Lilly's argument, to protect its know-how and input compounds. However, a flat 
prohibition on all cefaclor sales, as contained in the MSA included as Zenith Ex. 200 (and possibly maintained as a de facto 
agreement after the MSA was revised), goes far beyond the need to protect Lilly's technology. The situation in Polk Bros. was 
quite different. There the restrictions prohibited Forest City from selling major appliances and furniture and Polk Bros. from 
selling lawn mowers, building materials and related items at the building they built to house both businesses on one plot of land. 
Polk Bros., 776 F.2d at 187. The procompetitve aspect of the agreement was that it permitted them to combine their resources 
to create a one-stop shopping center for home improvement. The agreement was well-tailored to the task in that it did not limit 
what the parties could sell at other locations. Id. By limiting all cefaclor sales by Dobfar, the Lilly-Dobfar contract goes one step 
too far, thereby defeating Lilly's argument that the agreement was ancillary."
92,15," As Lilly admits, Lorabid did not turn out to be the blockbuster Lilly had hoped it would be, Lilly Opp. at 5-6, but a bad business 
decision is not the same thing as an illegitimate business decision. See  Valley Liquors, Inc. v. Renfield Importers, Ltd., 822 F.2d 
656, 662 (7th Cir. 1987) (""that [defendant] was 'punished' for its decision through subsequent poor sales does not mean it 
connived with or was influenced by the [alleged co-conspirators] in making the decision""). "
93,16," We consider this question with regard to the MSA memorialized in Zenith Exhibit 200, which is clearly an agreement in 
restraint of trade, and with regard to the time period covered under the later MSA, although we recognize that, for these years, 
the jury's consideration of the circumstantial evidence will determine whether the agreement restrained trade. "
95,17," In its Statement of Facts, P IV. 9, concerning negotiations with InterChem for Dobfar bulk cefaclor, Zenith states, ""Klein had 
more than 50 conversations with Pizza about obtaining Dobfar cefaclor."" Lilly's response is as follows: ""Admits only that Klein 
testified as to the alleged conversations, but denies that they occurred. Klein himself stated that he had no records of the alleged 
conversations."" Lilly's Resp. to Zenith's Stm. of Facts, P IV.9. Whether Klein is to believed on this issue is a question for the jury. "
96,18," Zenith cites this case for support of its argument that delay in FDA approval caused by antitrust activity undertaken by the 
defendant can constitute antitrust injury. Zenith's Notice of Supplemental Authority at 2. The situation in Andrx is quite different 
from that before us. In Andrx, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments permitted the defendant generic-manufacturer to delay the ability 
of other generic manufacturers to receive final FDA approval until after the defendant, as the first generic manufacturer, had 
been in the market for 180 days. Id. at 799. This statutory scheme, which played an important role in the appellate court's 
decision, is not at issue here."
96,19," More than one letter was sent because Zenith sought to register cefaclor in both oral suspension and capsule forms. Zenith 
Ex. 283, attach. 2. "

111,2," Entities that currently use shared hotsites include, inter alia, the United States Customs Service, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, 
Cingular Wireless, Honda, Siemens, Walgreens, Duke Energy, Pillsbury, Coca-Cola, Xerox, and numerous financial institutions. 
(See Gov. Exs. 1-2, 220, 244.) "
112,3," When a hotsite is not being used by a client, it is used for continuous testing of customer contingency plans. "
113,4," In 2000, Comdisco had [redacted] million in revenue (or 23 percent of its total revenue) from its high availability sales. (Def. Ex. 
170.) "
114,5," On November 15, 2001, Comdisco will pay its annual employee bonuses. If the future of the company remains undecided at 
that time, defendants believe that many Comdisco employees will leave the firm, thus substantially reducing its value. The 
parties therefore requested that the case be decided by that date. "
115,6," The discovery process was made even more challenging by the vast amount of confidential material that had to be obtained 
from a variety of sources in the disaster recovery industry. Yet, the parties and affected non-parties, working with the able 
assistance of Magistrate Judge John M. Facciola, were able to resolve these issues in a timely and civil manner."
115,7, This firm is currently representing defendant Comdisco in this matter.
115,8," A ninth fact witness, Peter MacLean of Guardian iT plc, a European business-continuity company, was omitted because the 
parties were unable to locate Mr. MacLean, who was on vacation, in order to depose him. "
116,9," It is undisputed that the relevant geographic market is North America. (See Complaint P 23; SunGard Answer P 23; Comdisco 
Answer P 23.) "
117,10," The government has defined midrange computers to include all UNIX-based systems that are not PC LAN systems. Under this 
definition, the covered midranges are: the AS/400, DEC, HP/9000, Filenet, NCR, RS/6000 & SP, Sequent, Stratus, Sun, 
Tandem, and Unisys platforms. (Gov. Ex. 102, at 3; Nov. 8 Trial Transcript, Vol. I, at 28-30.)"
117,11," Examples of customers excluded under this definition are those who use Intel-based computers and Windows and NT 
software. Plaintiff contends that these customers should be excluded from the relevant product market because they have a 
broader range of viable disaster recovery options than do those businesses with larger computing systems. "
119,12," Keating testified that one new company Mainline, now offers a quick-ship service for mainframes, although this product has an 
RTO of up to five days, rather than the three- or four-day maximum for shared hotsites. (Nov. 8 Trial Transcript, Vol. II, at 87-88.)"
119,13," According to the plaintiff's calculations, only 640 out of some 2,400 Comdisco customers use mainframe equipment (Gov. Ex. 
101), and just 887 of SunGard's 5,500 customers use mainframe equipment. (Gov. Exs. 80, 99.) "
120,14," Areeda has explained the concept of captive output in the context of iron ore. If iron ore is the relevant market and if shares are best measured there by sales, then internally used ore -- so-called 
captive output -- is part of the ore market even though it is not sold as such. In measuring the market power of a defendant selling iron ore, the ore used internally by other firms constrains the 
defendant's ability to profit by raising ore prices to monopoly levels. The higher ore price may induce an integrated firm to 
expand its ore production -- to supply others in direct competition with the alleged monopolist or to expand its own steel 
production and thereby reduce the demand of other steel makers for ore, or both. Hence, captive output constrains the 
defendant regardless of whether integrated firms sell their ore to other steel makers previously purchasing from the 
defendant. In sum, the integrated firm's ore output belongs in the market. Areeda P 535e (citing the Merger Guidelines § 1.31). "
121,15," The Heinz district court did note that homemade baby food was not a substitute under the antitrust laws for jarred baby food 
because ""the Supreme Court's interchangeability test refers to products."" 116 F. Supp. 2d at 195 (emphasis and internal 
quotations omitted). Unlike an internal disaster recovery system, however, homemade baby food is not an aspect of vertical 
integration; by definition, individual consumers cannot vertically integrate by producing a product that they would otherwise have 
to purchase. Section 1.31 of the Merger Guidelines also recognizes that vertical integration is relevant to the product market 
where that integration substitutes for a product that would otherwise have to be obtained from an external vendor. Merger 
Guidelines § 1.31. "
122,16," Plaintiff has ably demonstrated that for some of these customers, the switch to internal either has not happened, or if it has, it 
was not the result of a business decision related to the price of the external hotsite solution. (See Gov. Exs. 111B, D-I, L-O, Q-R, 
V.) However, the fact remains that more customers have left to pursue an internal solution than have left to go with a competitor 
and that this trend is continuing."
122,17," Defendants have introduced evidence that internal hotsites are becoming an even more viable competitive threat as 
technology develops. The trend toward smaller, distributed servers has enabled companies to more easily implement internal 
solutions. (See, e.g., Def. Ex. 72, Letter from General Mills; Def. Ex. 54; Def. Ex. 151, Simmons Decl. PP 8, 27, 33-34, 40.) The 
ability of companies to buy IBM's new ""MIPS-on-demand,"" which allows them to expand the capacity of their data processors in 
case of a disaster, also permits customers to move to an internal solution. (Def. Ex. 151, Simmons Decl. P 8; Gov. Ex. 98.) MIPS 
-- for ""millions of instructions per second"" -- is a measurement of computer processing capability, and the new IBM product 
allows a customer to partition the computer into smaller units that can be expanded in the event of a disaster, and then retracted 
afterward. (Id.) Finally, the declining price of computer hardware also permits customers to switch to an internal back-up more 
readily. (Def. Exs. 15, 151, Simmons Decl. P 34.)"
122,18," In fact, Gov. Ex. 62, which is a SunGard memo entitled ""The Hidden Costs of In-House Disaster Recovery,"" appears to focus 
on internal high availability because it discusses the high cost of data communications between the primary processor and the 
back-up site. Internal hotsites do not require such telecommunications, relying instead on back-up tapes for use only in the event 
of a disaster. "
123,19," Given the fact that the majority of SunGard's customers use a distributed UNIX or midrange system, it is especially difficult to 
argue that a substantial proportion of SunGard's customers will be unable to switch to an internal solution in light of the fact that 
a UNIX customer can recover on an internal basis more inexpensively than a mainframe customer. (See Def. Ex. 151, Simmons 
Decl. P 27.)"
123,20," The evidence also suggests that many combinations of the other forms of disaster recovery may be a substitute for shared 
hotsites. Unlike most antitrust cases, in which the product at issue is a discrete item -- such as the pen in Gillette, the hard-
walled containers in Owens-Illinois, the baby food in Heinz, and the loose-leaf tobacco in Swedish Match -- disaster recovery 
services encompass a variety of solutions that often complement each other, rather than a discrete product. While the 
government has proven that some forms of disaster recovery, when used alone, are not substitutes for a shared hotsite contract, 
there may well be combinations of these services that can be substituted for the traditional shared hotsite. In fact, most 
companies employ a variety of business continuity systems to meet their varying RTOs for different types of data, and as noted, 
more than half of SunGard's clients have contracts that allow them to determine their preferred recovery method at the time of 
the disaster. (Def. Ex. 151, Simmons Decl. P 11-12.) If the price of shared hotsites were to increase, the evidence suggests that 
some combination of, for example, work-area recovery and quick-ship, or internal hotsites and mobile recovery, may well be a 
viable substitute. As Simmons notes, ""customers do not demand hotsites -- they demand data protection in the most economical 
manner possible."" (Id. P 7.) Unlike a pen, a hard-walled container, baby food, or chewing tobacco, shared hotsites themselves 
may not be the ""product"" that is sought and purchased by disaster recovery customers. Rather, clients are buying the 
economical protection of data with a specific RTO -- shared hotsites are just one particular way to achieve that goal. It is 
therefore difficult to pigeonhole this somewhat nebulous ""product"" into traditional antitrust principles. "
124,21," Defendants' economist hypothesized that SunGard could not profitably afford to lose more than 5 percent of its customers in 
response to a SSNIP because of the relatively high profit derived from each additional customer. Because SunGard has 
insufficient information as to whether its customers would switch in response to a SSNIP, Harris testified that the company could 
not take the risk of raising prices. (Gov. Ex. 281, Harris Report PP 13-22.) In response, plaintiff has demonstrated that shared 
hotsite providers invest a great deal of time and money in gathering information about their customers and are typically aware of 
those clients that could switch to an alternative solution. (E.g., Gov. Ex. 107, Jackson Dep. at 53-56.)"
124,22," In addition, defendants have submitted letters from some 68 customers who have switched (Def. Exs. 6-14; 16-74), and other 
documents reflecting that their customers are considering such a switch. (See, e.g., Def. Exs. 92-94.) "
125,23," On the contrary, since defendants have submitted an equal or greater number of conflicting statements, one can only 
conclude that the statements submitted by both parties prove very little, if anything at all. Moreover, several of the declarations of 
fact witnesses deserve little, if any, weight. For instance, defendants' declaration of Charles Hollis, a vice-president of EMC, 
which is a huge computer outsourcer, is entitled to limited weight because EMC appears to have a vested interest in the 
outcome of this litigation. EMC had agreed to provide some financing for SunGard's acquisition of Comdisco, and thus, it may 
stand to gain substantial business if the transaction goes through. (Gov. Ex. 260.) Similarly, plaintiff's declaration from Brian 
Fowler of HP is also of little value because HP stands to win the auction for Comdisco if the SunGard purchase is successfully 
blocked. Finally, several customers submitted conflicting statements, telling the defendants one thing and the government 
another. See supra p. 18."
125,24," There is no question that time pressures may have prevented any thorough analysis of the many customers that will be 
affected by the proposed acquisition. It is, however, beyond dispute that the government must offer sufficient evidence to satisfy 
its burden of proof, and given the government's product market definition that includes a wide variety of computer equipment and 
customer types, a more detailed analysis was needed before one could draw any generalizations about the customers."
125,25," Because the Court has found that plaintiff has failed to meet its burden of establishing the relevant product market, it need not 
address the remaining disputed issues in the case -- the probable effect of the transaction on competition, the extent of 
concentration in the market, and defendants' arguments regarding the unreliability of plaintiff's market statistics, the likelihood of 
price discrimination, barriers to entry into the market, the effect of knowledgeable and sophisticated customers, and efficiencies 
resulting from the transaction. "
136,1," Section 1 of Title 15 of the United States Code provides, in pertinent part, that ""HN1[
] every contract, combination in the form 
of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby 
declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1."

is or is likely to be damaged by such an act."
136,15, U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1).
136,5," Section 52-568 of the Connecticut General Statutes provides, in pertinent part, that: HN5[
] any person who commences and prosecutes any civil action or complaint against another, in his own name or the 
name of others, or asserts a defense to any civil action or complaint commenced and prosecuted by another . . . (2) without 
probable cause, and with a malicious intent unjustly to vex and trouble such other person, shall pay him treble damages. Conn. Gen. Stat. § 52-568."
136,6," See  United Mine Workers of Am. v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585 (1965); E. RR. Presidents 
Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523 (1961). "
139,7," Jarrow cites to 15 U.S.C. § 22, as well as Cryomedics, Inc. v. Spembly, Ltd., 397 F. Supp. 287 (D. Conn. 1975), and Go-Video, 
Inc. v. Akai Elec. Co., 885 F.2d 1406 (9th Cir. 1989), in support of its argument. Section 22 of Title 15 of the United States Code provides that: HN11[
] any suit, action, or proceeding under the antitrust laws against any corporation may be brought not only in the judicial district whereof it is an inhabitant, but also in any district wherein it may be found or transacts business; and all 
process in such cases may be served in the district of which it is an inhabitant, or wherever it may be found."
139,15," U.S.C. § 22 (emphasis added). In Go-Video, Inc. v. Akai Electric Co., 885 F.2d 1406, 1413-15 (9th Cir. 1989), the court addressed whether the district court 
properly looked to the corporate defendants' national contacts to determine personal jurisdiction in an antitrust action. There, the 
court held that ""the worldwide service provision of § 12 [of the Clayton Act] justifies [the] conclusion that personal jurisdiction 
may be established in any district, given the existence of sufficient national contacts."" Go-Video, Inc., 885 F.2d at 1415. 
However, Go-Video is distinguishable from the issue presented here. In Go Video, the court relied on the federal antitrust act 
service provision, which applies exclusively to corporations, in adopting the nationwide contacts approach to personal 
jurisdiction. Here, the court is presented with the issue of whether there is personal jurisdiction over the individual defendants, 
Schwitters and Masquelier. Therefore, 15 U.S.C. § 22 and the nationwide contacts approach do not apply. Jarrow's reliance on Cryomedics, Inc. v. Spembly, Ltd., 397 F. Supp. 287 (D. Conn. 1975), is misplaced. There, the issue 
presented was whether the application of the Connecticut corporate long-arm statute, Conn. Gen. Stat. § 33-411(c), to a 
corporation incorporated in Great Britain was unconstitutional. Cryomedics, Inc. v. Spembly, 397 F. Supp. 287, 287-88 (D. Conn. 
1975). Here, the issue is what test should be applied to determine whether the court can exercise personal jurisdiction over 
individual foreign defendants, not whether the test selected is unconstitutional as applied to the defendants. "
140,8," Because Jarrow does not argue that Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(2) provides for personal jurisdiction over Schwitters and Masquelier, 
the court will not address this matter. "
142,9," Most of Jarrow's factual allegations as to Schwitters' misrepresentations are too generalized. For example, in paragraph 10 of 
the declaration of Jarrow L. Rogovin, Jarrow's president, he states that ""Schwitters . . . has actively participated in . . . marketing 
[the] litigations [concerning the 360 patent] to the public."" Also, paragraph 17 of the verified complaint alleges that ""Schwitters . . 
. publicized INC's false claim to ownership of the 360 patent."" Neither of these allegations indicates where these acts took place. 
Furthermore, when Jarrow specifically alleges where Schwitters made misrepresentations, the locations are not in Connecticut. 
See Rogovin Decl. P 11 (discussing Schwitters' appearances at two trade shows in California)."
142,10," As the defendants noted, this argument does not apply to Jarrow's vexatious litigation claim. "
144,11," See  United Mine Workers of Am. v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585 (1965); E. R.R. Presidents 
Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523 (1961)."
144,12," The defendants argue that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine should be applied to Jarrow's state and common law causes of 
action. The court agrees. In Suburban Restoration Co. v. ACMAT Corp., 700 F.2d 98, 102 (2d Cir. 1983), the court stated that 
""especially since Noerr-Pennington's statutory exemption is defined in terms of first amendment activity, we are confident that 
Connecticut's courts would carve out a similar exception to CUTPA and the common law, whether or not they believed that they 
were required to do so by the Constitution."" Although the Connecticut Supreme Court has yet to address this issue, the 
Connecticut appellate court recently held that ""seventeen years later, we fulfill the Second Circuit's prophecy and adopt the "
145,," Noerr-Pennington doctrine and its accompanying sham exception as the applicable analysis for cases such as this one [i.e., 
cases alleging vexatious litigation and tortious interference with business relationships.]"" Zeller v. Consolini, 59 Conn. App. 545, 
758 A.2d 376, 382 (Conn. App. Ct. 2000)."
145,13," As noted earlier, in addition to alleging that the defendants' lawsuit was a sham litigation, the complaint alleges other facts in 
support of the causes of action for federal and state antitrust violations, as well as Connecticut statutory and common law 
causes of action. Therefore, even if the court dismissed the allegations related to the prior litigation, the complaint would still 
state federal and state causes of action. "
153,1," According to the deposition of Ogden official, Jack Larson, Ogden's duties at the Target Center with regard to the team's use of 
the arena include maintenance, electrical work, ushering, security, setup and changeover, janitorial, and other work from general 
event usage. "
154,2," In per se cases, injury to competition is presumed because of the nature of the activity in question. See   N.W. Wholesale 
Stationers, Inc. v. Pac. Stationery & Printing Co., 472 U.S. 284, 289, 105 S. Ct. 2613, 2617, 86 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1985) (holding the 
""per se approach permits categorical judgments with respect to certain business practices that have proved to be predominantly 
anticompetitive""). The district court rejected Howard's assertion that he has stated per se antitrust violations. "
156,3," Howard's reliance on  Chicago Prof'l Sports Ltd. P'ship v. Nat'l Basketball Ass'n, 961 F.2d 667 (7th Cir. 1992) for the 
proposition that the team, through its contracts, acted with Ogden ""like a cartel to restrict the output of photographs"" is 
misplaced. Chicago Prof'l Sports Ltd. actually supports the team's argument that it is free to contract with photographers. The 
court acknowledged that, even though producers complain about efforts of business rivals that reduce their profits, judicial relief 
from real injuries caused by rivalry would harm consumers.   Id. at 669. The NBA does not require the team to contract with NBA 
Photos. The team finds it commercially reasonable to do so. "
163,1," As these motions have been determined to make a facial challenge to the amended complaint, material outside the amended 
complaint, specifically the Affidavit of Bernard Persky in Opposition to Defendants' Joint Motion to Dismiss dated July 13, 2001, 
is hereby excluded from consideration."
163,2," Briefing was completed as to the motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. Certain 
defendants also moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction; the Court granted those defendants permission to postpone 
briefing of that issue until after resolution of the other issues. "
175,1," A&E does not seek to dismiss Accessory's patent infringement or false patent marketing counterclaims, nor Accessory's claims 
against Andrew Zimmerman. "
195,1," Two year later, in the course of striking down another class action asbestos settlement on procedural grounds, the Supreme 
Court repeated this message in Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 815, 821-22, 144 L. Ed. 2d 715, 119 S. Ct. 2295 (1999). "
204,2," Lobbying activities directed towards influencing Congressional policies constitute an exercise of the First Amendment right to 
petition government. See  Liberty Lobby, Inc. v. Pearson, 129 U.S. App. D.C. 74, 390 F.2d 489, 491 (D.C. Cir. 1968)."
204,3," The LMRDA Bill of Rights, 29 U.S.C. § 411, grants to union members democratic rights such as freedom of speech and 
assembly, the right to vote in union elections, and a guarantee of due process in disciplinary proceedings. "
212,4," Because the Complaint fails to plead adequately the predicate acts of extortion, witness tampering and mail and wire fraud, the 
issues of continuity and standing under RICO are not reached. "
213,5," If the predicate acts of mail and wire fraud are properly repleaded, and those pleadings satisfy the continuity and standing 
requirements of RICO, the conspiracy claim will be revisited as well."
213,6," As previously noted, plaintiff argues that New Jersey law applies to the contract issues, including this one. At this stage, the 
choice of New Jersey or New York law does not materially effect the outcome. Therefore, no determination as to the applicable 
law is made. See, e.g.  Curley v. AMR Corp., 153 F.3d 5, 12 (2d Cir. 1998). "
220,1," This Court notes that there was no opposition filed on behalf of the Intervenor, Ridlon, to defendants' motion. "
228,1," Prior to the hearing, plaintiff submitted a Notice of Intent, in which it stated that it would seek to establish its rights to a 
preliminary injunction solely with respect to its Count I claim of attempted monopolization (with inclusion of its Count III claims ""to 
the extent they are subsumed within Count I"") and its Count V claim of tortious interference with contractual relations. (Dkt. No. 
111, at 1). "
244,2," The plaintiff must meet the heightened requirement because the ""reality of the existing status and relationship between the 
parties"" is the extant, freely negotiated, and shortly to be implemented contract between Raytheon and PHS, which has been 
incorporated by reference into the Raytheon workers' collective bargaining agreement. See  Dominion Video Satellite, Inc. v. 
EchoStar Satellite Corp., 269 F.3d 1149 (10th Cir. 2001). This is not a case in which the party opposing injunctive relief has 
sought to unilaterally create a new status quo simply to create a heightened burden for the movant. To the contrary, the "
245,," Raytheon-PHS contract was the result of months of independent negotiations between the parties. Subsequent to the adoption 
of the contract, the defendants, Raytheon, and thousands of Raytheon workers and members of their families have relied upon 
the contract for planning their health care services. These services will commence in less than two weeks. If the requirement to 
show an additional level of proof before altering the status quo is ever applicable, it is surely applicable here. However, the issue is not controlling. CHC-KS has failed to demonstrate its entitlement to a preliminary injunction generally, 
even without the application of the heightened burden of showing that the factors relative to injunctive relief weigh heavily and 
compellingly in its favor. "
251,3," Alternatively, even if the court were to assume plaintiff's claims of tortious interference were actionable, no basis for the 
requested relief would exist under the facts presented to the court. The evidence provided to the court establishes first, that 
defendants' acquisition of the Raytheon business was not tortious, but a lawful and justifiable business decision taking the form 
of a better bid for the Raytheon account, and second, that plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that, in light of its own noncompliant 
bid and additional competition from Blue Cross, it had any reasonable expectation of actually retaining the Raytheon business. "
261,1," We note that at least two of the defendant companies, Exxon Corporation and Mobil Corporation, have since merged."
261,2," Issues regarding class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 are not addressed in the district court's opinion or in the litigants' 
briefs. The only issue before the Court is whether plaintiff states a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). "
264,3," See, e.g., Hack, 237 F.3d at 86-87 (Yale University competes with other schools and thus is not its own product market); 
Tanaka v. Univ. of S. Cal., 252 F.3d 1059, 1063-64 (9th Cir. 2001) (UCLA women's soccer program does not constitute its own 
market because other college programs compete to recruit student-athletes); Queen City, 124 F.3d at 438 (market cannot be 
limited to products approved by Domino's Pizza for Domino's stores); Subsolutions, Inc. v. Doctor's Assocs., 62 F. Supp. 2d 616, 
625 (D. Conn. 1999) (Subway franchise is not a distinct market from comparable franchise opportunities); Re-Alco Indus., Inc. v. 
Nat'l Ctr. for Health Educ., Inc., 812 F. Supp. 387, 391-92 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (one particular brand of health education materials is "
265,," not a relevant product market); Theatre Party Assocs. v. Shubert Org., 695 F. Supp. 150, 153-55 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (tickets to the 
play ""Phantom of the Opera"" are not a relevant product market); Shaw v. Rolex Watch, U.S.A., Inc., 673 F. Supp. 674, 678-79 
(S.D.N.Y. 1987) (Rolex watches clearly are interchangeable with other high quality time pieces). These cases would be 
applicable to this case if plaintiff were alleging that Exxon alone constitutes the relevant product market, but plaintiff does not so 
allege."
265,4," See, e.g., Gianna Enters., 551 F. Supp. at 1354 (rejecting a market limited to international beauty pageants where plaintiff 
""made no attempt to explain"" why the product market should be so limited); North Jersey Secretarial Sch. v. McKiernan, 713 F. 
Supp. 577, 583 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (finding that the plaintiff ""fails to explain the basis"" for the market alleged in the complaint). "
266,5," The observation by the district court and defendants about the large differences among the various MPT jobs is better 
understood not as speaking to interchangeability, but as indicating that not all MPT employees are affected by the conspiracy in 
the same way -- thus creating potential difficulties with class certification. While interchangeability of the different types of 
employees is not an element of market definition in an oligopsony, the different types of employees will differ in how they must 
prove the interchangeability among employers. For example, as the district court and defendants point out, oil industry 
employers may not be interchangeable with pharmaceutical industry employers from the standpoint of a petroleum geologist, but 
the two may be more interchangeable from the standpoint of a labor lawyer. More importantly, the means of proof may be quite 
different; at trial the geologists must present evidence of the relative job prospects for geologists outside the oil industry, while 
the lawyers must explore the legal job market. That this large class might have difficulty meeting the predominance and typicality 
requirements for Rule 23 certification, however, does not indicate that plaintiff fails to state a claim upon which relief can be 
granted. "
267,6," Even antitrust lawyers -- the favorite example used by the district court and defendants -- could be subject to this effect.  Todd, 
126 F. Supp. 2d at 325. While defendants are correct that ""there is no specialized body of antitrust law applicable only to the oil 
industry,"" antitrust involves extensive empirical research into the business specifics of a particular industry, and it is not 
inconceivable that a lawyer who has spent a career mastering the subtleties of the oil and petrochemical industry would be more 
valuable within that industry."
267,7," Defendants, while not relying on this argument, note that plaintiff left Exxon for a higher-paying job outside the oil industry. This 
fact, however, is but one small piece of the broader cross-elasticity analysis. Moreover, it does not bear on plaintiff's standing, as 
the alleged economic harm to plaintiff lies in her receiving an artificially low salary during the relevant time period -- not in any 
harm she suffered upon leaving the industry. See Compl. P 102. "
268,8," For example, at oral argument defendants suggested that pilots -- a category of MPT employee -- may have a dubious claim of 
cross-industrial inelasticity."
268,9," See also  Henry v. Chloride, Inc., 809 F.2d 1334, 1342 (8th Cir. 1987) (considering ""evidence that the industry itself viewed 
route sales as a separate market""); Beatrice Foods Co. v. FTC, 540 F.2d 303, 308 (7th Cir. 1976) (finding a market limited to 
aerosol painting cans where ""aerosol manufacturers regard themselves as a separate industry""); FTC v. Staples, Inc., 970 F. 
Supp. 1066, 1079-80 (D.D.C. 1997) (finding that office supply superstores constitute a market distinct from other office supply 
stores and catalogues where defendant's own documents regarding competitive strategy ""focus primarily on competition from 
other superstores""). "
270,10," Likewise, in Sugar Institute the Court found a violation involving data exchange among 15 companies holding 70-80% of the 
market, although the specific violation was limited to the agreement among defendants not to offer secret concessions below the 
announced prices.  297 U.S. at 572, 601-02."
270,11," We are not persuaded by defendants' attempt to distinguish Container Corp. on the basis that the six largest firms in that case 
controlled 60% of the relevant market. Even as a mathematical matter, the difference pointed out by defendants is not 
overwhelming. If we assume that the market in this case is as unconcentrated as possible -- that is, each of the 14 defendants 
has an equal market share and the rest of the market is fragmented -- the six ""largest"" firms could still have nearly a 40% market 
share based on the allegations in the complaint. This difference between Container Corp. and the instant case cannot support a 
Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal under the circumstances of this case. "
271,12," We reach a similar conclusion as did the Ninth Circuit when it analyzed the oil industry in a case alleging gasoline price fixing 
aided by the public dissemination of price information by 13 named defendants. See  In re Coordinated, 906 F.2d at 436. The 
court recognized that the market would not be deemed highly concentrated under the Merger Guidelines, but nonetheless 
concluded that ""the gasoline markets under discussion here appear to lie in that gray area where, although not altogether 
inevitable, interdependence is distinctly possible."" Id. 906 F.2d at 444; see also  Five Smiths, Inc. v. Nat'l Football League 
Players Ass'n, 788 F. Supp. 1042, 1054 (D. Minn. 1992) (distinguishing In re Coordinated from the facts before the court partly 
on the basis that ""the structure of the gasoline market [was] well within the parameters set by the Supreme Court in Container 
Corp.""). "
273,13," Also problematic is the ABC Survey (Above Base Compensation). This survey was designed to capture data regarding bonus 
payments above base compensation that were not being captured in the Job Match and Job Family Surveys. Compl. P 80. 
Similarly, the ""B-1"" and ""B-2"" surveys collected additional information from defendants regarding bonuses and other non-
standard payments. Id. P 82. These surveys have anticompetitive potential, as they bear earmarks of practices designed to 
police a conspiracy by preventing ""cheating"" -- analogous to sellers who share information targeting off-list discount sales by 
competitors. "
283,1," Twenty-five years after National Casualty the Supreme Court of the United States laid out HN7[
] a three-pronged test for 
determining what is the ""business of insurance"" for purposes of deciding whether the McCarran Act precludes application of 
federal antitrust law.  Union Labor Life Ins. Co. v. Pireno, 458 U.S. 119, 73 L. Ed. 2d 647, 102 S. Ct. 3002 (1982). These 
prongs are, first, whether the practice transfers or spreads a policyholder's risk; second, whether the practice is an integral part 
of the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured; and third, whether the practice is limited to entities within the 
insurance industry. Id. at 129. Although it could be argued that Pireno impliedly overruled National Casualty, United States 
Department of Treasury v. Fabe, 508 U.S. 491, 124 L. Ed. 2d 449, 113 S. Ct. 2202 (1993), casts doubt upon that interpretation. 
In Fabe the Court noted that Pireno dealt with the McCarran Act's effect on antitrust laws, which the Court found readily 
distinguishable from other laws.  Id. at 504. This is because there are two separate clauses in the McCarran Act. According to 
the Supreme Court, the second clause, which proscribes application of antitrust laws, is more ""narrowly circumscribed"" than the 
first clause, which deals with federal laws in general. Id. Only the first clause is pertinent in this case. The general clause (the first clause) provides: ""no Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law 
enacted by any State for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance . . . ."" The Supreme Court sees a distinction 
between the ""business of insurance"" and laws that serve the purpose of regulating the business of insurance. This distinction 
makes it difficult, if not impossible, to apply Pireno to insurance advertising under the Lanham Act, because the Lanham Act is a 
general law controlled by the first clause. In a case on point, a South Carolina District Court concluded that National Casualty 
remains good law, and held that laws regulating insurance advertising are laws whose purpose is to regulate the business of 
insurance. Colonial Life & Accident Ins. Co. v. American Family Life Assurance Co., 846 F. Supp. 454, 460 (D.S.C. 1994). "
286,2," It is worth noting that, although the cases did not discuss possible McCarran-Ferguson preclusion, this Court, and the District 
Courts in this Circuit, have routinely exercised jurisdiction over Lanham Act claims involving the insurance industry. See, e.g., 
U.S. Healthcare, Inc. v. Blue Cross, 898 F.2d 914 (3d Cir. 1990); American Fidelity & Liberty Ins. Co. v. American Fidelity Group, 
2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13863, 2000 WL 1385899, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 25, 2000); Guardian Life Ins. Co. v. American Guardian 
Life Assurance Co., 943 F. Supp. 509 (E.D. Pa. 1996)."
286,3," We have appellate jurisdiction, although the order before us is interlocutory.  HN12[
]  28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) permits an appeal from an order granting an injunction. "
287,4, UPMC included rehabilitation and psychiatric facilities in determining the number of hospitals it offers.
287,5," In arguing for its definition, UPMC points only to a previous advertisement by Highmark that similarly used the term ""access."" 
More evidence is needed to prove its definition is the objective industry standard. For instance, in addition to competitors' 
advertisements, the defendant in Illinois Bell Telephone Co. v. MCI Telecommunications Corp. produced employee testimony 
and definitions used by expert sources in the industry.  1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18337, 1996 WL 717466, *4 (N.D. Ill. 1996). In 
Castrol Inc. v. Pennzoil Co., the District Court heard expert testimony to help it determine the industry standard. 799 F. Supp. 
424, 437 (D. N.J. 1992). One advertisement is not sufficient proof of an industry standard. However, we note that the burden of 
proving the objective industry standard definition rests on the plaintiff and not on the defendant.  Id. at 436. "
288,6," Thus, if we wish to, we can apply the doctrine.  Harris v. City of Philadelphia, 47 F.3d 1333, 1342 (3d Cir. 1995); Gaudiosi v. 
Mellon, 269 F.2d 873, 881 (3d Cir. 1959). "

contract, negligent misrepresentation, statutory and other claims within a constitutional format. Such a format includes individual 
demonstrations of the substantive elements of Plaintiffs' claims, including causation and damages. See e.g., Cimino v. Raymark

""must be granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner."" Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 552 (1965). The

Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422, 428 (1982); Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 807 (1985)(""a chose in action

defense, like an element of the tort claim itself, is merely one aspect of the State's definition of that property interest.""). Any

1992)(""due process requires that a fair opportunity to present unique defenses, by separate trials or otherwise, must be 
afforded""). Thus, the Universities have a constitutional right to require that each putative class member prove their alleged 
contract, negligent misrepresentation, statutory and other claims within a constitutional format. Such a format includes individual 
demonstrations of the substantive elements of Plaintiffs' claims, including causation and damages. See e.g., Cimino v. Raymark 
Indus., Inc., 151 F.3d 297, 312, 319 (5th Cir. 1998)(""Causation must be determined as to individuals, not groups ... the Seventh

WL 1357, *5 (N.D. Ind. 1978), ""while this court is mindful of the important policy considerations which underlie Rule 23 actions,

344,2," The Attorney General asserts the CIDs themselves constitute a pending state proceeding, but that is not so. CIDs may be 
issued not only to targets or subjects of an investigation, but also to witnesses. Unless and until someone files a proceeding in 
court, CIDs are simply part of an executive branch investigation. See, e.g.,  In re Ezell, 446 So. 2d 253, 255 (Fla. 5th DCA 
1984) (stating that a § 542.28 CID is not a court proceeding over which Florida Supreme Court has rule making authority but is "
345,," instead only an ""investigative tool through which the attorney general may exercise his obligation as chief legal officer of the 
state, to investigate, independently of any court proceedings, suspected violations of the state or federal antitrust laws""). Far 
from part of a legal proceeding, a CID may be issued only before a legal proceeding is filed; once the Attorney General files suit, 
he may no longer issue CIDs. See § 542.28(1), Fla. Stat. (2001). Moreover, it seems likely that the vast majority of CIDs result 
merely in compliance, with no court proceeding ever filed by anyone, unless the investigation leads to the filing of an 
enforcement action, which may or may not occur. "

346,8," Butterworth v. National League, 644 So. 2d 1021 (Fla. 1994). "
347,9," In Piazza v. Major League Baseball, 831 F. Supp. 420 (E.D. Pa. 1993), the court concluded that Federal Baseball was really 
just a reserve clause case, citing the opinion of the lower court. See  National League v. Federal Baseball Club, 50 App. D.C. 
165, 269 F. 681 (C.C.D.C. 1920). Whatever the lower court might have thought, the Supreme Court thought Federal Baseball 
dealt with other issues, over and above the reserve clause. It is an odd approach to interpreting Supreme Court cases to 
disregard that Court's own description of a case in favor of a lower court's description. "
348,10," Indeed, in dissent Justice Frankfurter, a jurist of no small intellect, said it would ""baffle the subtlest ingenuity to find a single 
differentiating factor between other sporting exhibitions, whether boxing or football or tennis, and baseball insofar as the conduct 
of the sport is relevant to the criteria or considerations by which the Sherman Law becomes applicable to a 'trade or commerce.'"" 
348 U.S. at 248. Justice Frankfurter underestimated the Florida Attorney General's subtle ingenuity: baseball has a reserve 
clause, but boxing does not. Had the baseball exemption been limited to the reserve clause, this distinction between baseball 
and boxing would not have been so baffling to the justices of the Supreme Court, who missed it clean. "
350,11," To be sure, the Court itemized four reasons for the result in Toolson: (a) Congressional awareness for three decades of the Court's ruling in Federal Baseball, coupled with congressional 
inaction. (b) The fact that baseball was left alone to develop for that period upon the understanding that the reserve system 
was not subject to existing federal antitrust laws. (c) A reluctance to overrule Federal Baseball with consequent retroactive 
effect. (d) A professed desire that any needed remedy be provided by legislation rather than by court decree."
350,407," U.S. at 273-74. In saying that baseball was left to develop on the understanding that the reserve clause was not subject to 
the antitrust laws, the Court did not say any other aspect of baseball was subject to the antitrust laws, and the Court immediately 
made clear that any such suggestion would be wrong. In the very next sentence after the quotation just given, the Court said that 
the ""emphasis"" in Toolson was that ""Congress had no intention to include baseball within the reach of the federal antitrust laws."" 
Id. (emphasis added). In context, it is clear that the reference in the quotation to the reserve clause was simply a reference to the 
aspect of the business of baseball that happened to be involved in Toolson, just as, in the very same sentence, the Court 
referred to ""that period,"" that is, the period between 1922 and 1953. Just as the rule of Toolson was not applicable only to events 
between 1922 and 1953, so also the rule was not limited to the reserve clause, as the Court's own explicit and repeated 
description of the rule, in Toolson and Flood and the other cases discussed in the text above, made clear."
350,12," As part of its discussion of International Boxing, the Flood Court also quoted Justice Frankfurter's statement in dissent that any 
effort to distinguish boxing and baseball would ""baffle the subtlest ingenuity."" The Flood Court, like the International Boxing 
Court, did not even conceive the distinction on which the Attorney General now relies: that the baseball exemption was really 
only a reserve clause exemption. See footnote 10 supra. "
351,13," Immediately before this statement, the Court said that ""with its reserve system enjoying exemption from the federal antitrust 
laws, baseball is, in a very distinct sense, an exception and an anomaly."" Id. The statement that the antitrust-exempt reserve 
system makes baseball an anomaly is hardly a statement that it is only the reserve system that is exempt from the antitrust laws. 
The Court's very next sentence confirmed this, explicitly saying that Federal Baseball and Toolson ""are confined to baseball."" 
The Court did not say those decisions were confined to baseball's reserve clause. As set forth in the text, on numerous other 
occasions, in Flood and earlier decisions, the Court very clearly articulated the exemption as applicable to the business of 
baseball, not merely the reserve clause. Each and every time the Court defined the exemption, it defined it as applicable to the 
""business of baseball"" or an equivalent; the Court never defined the exemption as applicable only to the reserve clause."
351,14," Inexplicably, the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and Florida Supreme Court cases on which the Attorney General now relies 
concluded that Federal Baseball and Toolson were not ""fully entitled to the benefit of stare decisis"" but only a limited version 
thereof. The United States Supreme Court explicitly said the contrary. "
352,15," The Court also said, as part of this discussion, that it had concluded that ""Congress as yet has had no intention to subject 
baseball's reserve system to the reach of the antitrust statutes."" Id. Some of the bills introduced in Congress had addressed only 
the reserve system; indeed, Congress now has passed legislation speaking only to the reserve system, not the other aspects of 
the business of baseball. See 15 U.S.C. § 27a. It was the reserve system that was specifically challenged in Flood. The Court's 
statement that Congress had not chosen to apply the antitrust laws to the reserve system - despite legislation that would have 
done so - was an accurate statement of the congressional inaction that was critical to the outcome of Flood. The Court never 
suggested in any way, however, that only the reserve system was exempt; to the contrary, in the immediately preceding 
sentence, the Court said ""baseball"" had been allowed to develop since 1922 unhindered by the antitrust laws. The Court had 
said repeatedly, in Flood and the earlier decisions, that the ""business of baseball,"" not merely the reserve clause, was exempt 
from the antitrust laws. The suggestion that the Court's reference to the reserve clause shows that in all those other instances 
the Court did not mean what it said simply will not withstand analysis. "
353,16," Plaintiffs assert that the Curt Flood Act, 15 U.S.C. § 27a, adopted in 1998, constitutes an endorsement by Congress of the 
exemption of the business of baseball. I disagree. In that Act, Congress expressly subjected matters directly affecting 
employment of baseball players (including the reserve clause) to the antitrust laws, to the same extent those laws are applicable 
to other professional sports. But Congress also made clear that this did not render the antitrust laws applicable to baseball in any 
other respect. See 15 U.S.C. § 27a(b). Properly construed, this does not affect the issues in the case at bar one way or the 
other, because Congress explicitly indicated its intention not to affect issues other than direct employment matters. Thus 
Congress said, ""No court shall rely on the enactment of this section as a basis for changing the application of the antitrust laws 
to any conduct, acts, practices, or agreements other than"" player issues. Id. I take Congress at its word and resolve this case 
without reliance on the Curt Flood Act as affecting the outcome one way or the other. I conclude that the business of baseball is 
exempt; the exemption was well established long prior to adoption of the Curt Flood Act and certainly was not repealed by that 
Act."
353,17," The Attorney General notes that the Eleventh Circuit's opinion was brief and included little analysis. Far from a reason to 
disregard the holding, this simply confirms that the issue was easy and the result clear; the Supreme Court had thrice resolved 
the matter. The instant opinion to the contrary notwithstanding, lower courts are not in the habit of writing long and detailed 
opinions on issues squarely resolved by controlling decisions of higher courts; there is quite enough other work to do. And in any 
event, short decisions of the Eleventh Circuit are no less binding in this court than long ones. "
354,18," The Attorney General asserts that the contraction decision may have been motivated by economic (and indeed anti-
competitive) concerns rather than concern for the nature and quality of the game. For two reasons, this does not help the 
Attorney General. First, the applicability of the antitrust exemption does not turn on whether any antitrust claim would otherwise 
be well founded; the whole point is that the antitrust laws do not apply, thus exempting even anti-competitive conduct from 
liability. Second, the Attorney General's apparent assertion that economics, on the one hand, and the nature and quality of the 
game, on the other, are wholly separate concerns is obviously incorrect; at least dating to the sale of Babe Ruth by the Red Sox, 
the interplay between economics and the nature and quality of the game has been obvious. It would be irrational for club owners 
to ignore economics, which in the long run (and probably the short) necessarily will impact the nature and quality of the game; 
and it would be irrational to ignore the nature and quality of the game, which in the long run (and probably the short) will impact 
economics. Any assertion that club owners should, could or ever did make a decision on the number of clubs in the league 
without considering both economics and other factors affecting the nature and quality of the game would be wholly fanciful. Cf.  
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (refusing to 
sustain antitrust claim based on inference that party acted in manner contrary to its own economic interests)."
354,19," If this were the only basis for the conclusion that the business of baseball is exempt from the Florida Antitrust Act, a nice 
question would be presented concerning my authority to address the matter. Under Pennhurst State School and Hosp. v. 
Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 121, 104 S. Ct. 900, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1984), the Eleventh Amendment bars an action for injunctive 
relief against a state official based on an alleged violation of state law. It may be unclear whether the holding would apply when, 
as here, the alleged violation is of a state law that by its terms explicitly incorporates a federal standard, so that, in effect, any 
injunction is based on an interpretation of federal law. I need not address the issue here, however, because, for the reasons set 
forth in the text that follows, the Florida Antitrust Act is inapplicable anyway, as a matter of federal law. "
355,20," It is true that, within this quotation, there is a reference to the reserve system, but this does not help the Attorney General. The 
Court quoted the district court as saying there was a need for national uniformity ""in any regulation of baseball and its reserve[] 
system."" (Id., emphasis added.) Had either the district court or Supreme Court intended this as a limitation of the exemption to 
the reserve system, the reference presumably would have been to the need for uniformity ""in any regulation of baseball's 
reserve system,"" not the need for uniformity in regulation of ""baseball and its reserve system."" Moreover, as part of this 
discussion, the Supreme Court, in its own language not quoted from the courts below, identified the scope of its decision as 
""organized baseball,"" not merely the reserve clause. In context, it is clear that the Court viewed the exemption as an exemption 
for ""organized baseball,"" with the quotation of the district court's reference to the reserve system simply an accurate statement of 
the aspect of baseball involved in the particular case. "
356,21," HN5[
] Under §§ 542.28 and 542.27(3), Florida Statutes, an antitrust CID may issue ""whenever the Attorney General . . . suspects that a violation of [the Florida Antitrust Act] or federal laws pertaining to restraints of trade is imminent, occurring, or 
has occurred."" DUTPA, in contrast, authorizes issuance of subpoenas if the Attorney General ""has reason to believe that a 
person has engaged in, or is engaging in, an act or practice that violates"" DUTPA. § 501.206, Fla. Stat. It of course is possible 
that the Attorney General could suspect a violation of the antitrust laws, but have no reason to believe there has been a DUTPA 
violation, and vice versa. The fact that the Attorney General issued antitrust CIDs in the case at bar thus does not mean he also 
had grounds for issuance of DUTPA subpoenas."
356,22," CIDs may include written interrogatories, see § 542.28(1)(b), while there is no provision for written interrogatories in DUTPA 
subpoenas. The CIDs at issue in the case at bar include written interrogatories; these apparently would not be appropriate in a 
DUTPA subpoena."
356,23," Compare § 542.28(5), Fla. Stat. (antitrust CIDs) with § 501.206(1), Fla. Stat. (DUTPA subpoenas). The CIDs at issue explicitly 
advise the recipients of the procedures applicable to antitrust CIDs. They do not advise the recipients of the distinct procedures 
applicable to DUTPA subpoenas."
356,24," Compare § 542.28(9), Fla. Stat., with § 501.206(5), Fla. Stat."
356,25," As a matter of state law, the Attorney General may or may not have authority to issue subpoenas under DUTPA to investigate 
the possible contraction of Major League Baseball. What is clear, however, is that he has not done so. Whether he properly 
could do so is not an issue now before this court. "
357,26," Because collateral estoppel is an affirmative defense, the burden of proof is on the Attorney General, as the defendant, 
requiring that an issue on which there is no proof be resolved in favor of plaintiffs."
357,27," As confirmation of this, consider the possibility that, after issuance of the 1994 CID to the National League, a state circuit court 
in Tampa had addressed not the antitrust exemption issue, but the issue of whether, as a factual matter, a specific interrogatory 
included in the CIDs was outside the scope of the investigation authorized by state law or was overly burdensome. If the Tampa 
court resolved this issue in the Attorney General's favor, and the Attorney General then issued a new CID to the Marlins, would 
the Marlins be estopped from challenging the CID on the same grounds in a Miami circuit court? Under Florida law, the answer 
is no. The Marlins, like the police officer in Gentile, would be entitled to their own day in court. Even more clearly, Mr. Selig 
individually, or the later-created American League Devil Rays, would be so entitled. In short, Butterworth's ability to command 
acceptance in later cases involving other CIDs and other parties stems not from its binding collateral estoppel effect but from its 
precedential value, which, for the reasons set forth earlier in this opinion, is insufficient to carry the day, given the contrary 
decisions of the United States Supreme Court and the Eleventh Circuit. "
359,28," In Teper v. Miller, 82 F.3d 989, 992 n.3 (11th Cir. 1996), the Eleventh Circuit said: HN7[
] In order to warrant the grant of a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff has the burden of proving four factors: (1) a 
substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a substantial threat of irreparable injury if the injunction were not granted; 
(3) that the threatened injury to the plaintiff outweighs the harm an injunction may cause the defendant; and (4) that 
granting the injunction would not disserve the public interest. See also  Canal Authority v. Callaway, 489 F.2d 567, 572 (5th Cir. 1974). I find these criteria satisfied here. "
369,1," This suit was filed on May 5, 1997, and the applicable statute of limitations is four years. TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE § 2.725(a)-
(b). The Plaintiffs have not alleged that the Defendants made any specific representation about future performance, which can, 
in certain circumstances, extend the time frame for bringing suit on an express warranty. See id.; Cornerstones Mun. Util. Dist. 
v. Monsanto Co., 889 S.W.2d 570, 577 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1994, writ denied)."
369,2," The district court correctly concluded that most of the other ""representations"" cited by the Plaintiffs were insufficient to 
constitute express warranties. "
370,3," We do not necessarily agree with the Harris Court's dicta that the Texas Products Liability Act does not violate the open courts 
provision simply because it does not preclude manufacturing defect and express warranty claims. See  Harris, 232 F.3d at 458. "
378,1," Because the Court has already held that plaintiffs lack standing to bring claims under a theory of essential facilities, the Court 
does not address defendant's argument in reply that the cases cited by plaintiff to support standing did not involve essential 
facilities claims. See Def.'s Reply at 2:12-3:26. "

384,5," Indeed, appellants eventually brought claims alleging violations of the Missouri Antitrust Law. These claims are currently 
pending in state court. Godfrey v. Pulitzer Publishing Co., No. 982-319, Circuit Court for the City of St. Louis, Missouri."
384,6," The original complaint included nineteen counts, each alleging a violation of Section 2(a). At issue in this appeal is only Count I, 
which sought the injunction based on Pulitzer's allegedly discriminatory pricing scheme."
384,7," As we laid out in Godfrey v. Pulitzer Publ'g Co., 161 F.3d 1137, 1140 (8th Cir. 1998) (hereinafter ""Godfrey I""), courts have held 
that section 2(a) applies to three categories of violations: A primary-line violation occurs where ""the discriminating seller's price 
discrimination adversely impacts competition with his -- the seller's -- competitors;"" a secondary-line violation occurs where ""the 
discriminating seller's price discrimination injures competition among [the seller's] customers . . .;"" and a tertiary violation occurs 
where the customers of the purchasers of the discriminating seller ""compete[] within a unified market region."" Best Brands 
Beverage, Inc. v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 842 F.2d 578, 584 n.1 (2d Cir. 1987) (citation omitted). Appellants have alleged a 
secondary-line violation where appellants and favored branch dealers are customers of Pulitzer, the allegedly discriminating 
seller. Godfrey I, 161 F.3d at 1140."
384,8," The term ""commerce"" in section 2(a) refers to ""trade or commerce among the several States and with foreign nations . . . .""

(1974). "
385,9," On remand, the district court additionally found that appellants' evidence was not sufficient to establish the interstate commerce 
requirement. This conclusion is puzzling, given our holding in Godfrey I affirming that the interstate commerce requirement of 
section 2(a) is jurisdictional in nature and that it has been met in this case.  161 F.3d at 1141. At that time, we discussed the 
standard for determining whether the ""in commerce"" requirement has been met: ""' With almost perfect consistency, the Courts of 
Appeals have read the language requiring either or any of the purchases involved in such discrimination (be) in commerce to 
mean that § 2(a) applies only where at least one of the two transactions which, when compared, generate discrimination . . . 
crosses a state line.'"" Godfrey I, 161 F.3d at 1141 (quoting Gulf Oil, 419 U.S. at 200) (internal quotation omitted). We agreed 
with the district court that appellants had met this standard because the sales to the Illinois branch dealers (some of whom are 
appellants and some of whom are favored branch dealers) cross state lines. In our current review, which takes place in the 
context of the grant of summary judgment on the same set of facts, we see no reason to abandon our holding in Godfrey I. "
386,10," Two cases cited by Pulitzer for the proposition that newspaper distributors operating in exclusive geographic territories do not 
compete, Newberry v. Washington Post Co., 438 F. Supp. 470 (D.D.C. 1977) and Davidson v. Kansas City Star Co., 202 F. 
Supp. 613 (W.D. Mo. 1962), are distinguishable. The distributors in these cases delivered to homes and not to subs or vending 
machines. Unlike customers of home delivery, retail customers can choose to purchase the newspaper in an area other than 
their place of residence."
386,11," It is true, as appellants have argued, that the favored branch dealers can offer lower prices to the subs in their territory than 
appellants can to the subs in their territories. But, unlike the retail customers of the Post-Dispatch, the subs cannot move outside 
of their geographic area to purchase from a branch dealer charging lower rates; therefore there is no competition as to this "
387,," aspect of the branch dealer's business. The possibility, raised by appellants, that a chain store could purchase copies of the 
Post-Dispatch from a favored branch dealer and then distribute copies to its chain locations in non-favored territories, is mere 
speculation that is not substantiated by any record evidence."
387,12," A customer who purchases a newspaper at Hardee's at 3:50 am every morning buys in a different branch dealer's area if the 
paper is not available at the Hardee's at that hour."
387,13," To the extent that we do not consider whether competition is affected by the alleged price discrimination, our analysis of 
course differs from that of the district court, which additionally concluded that ""the court finds plaintiffs have not shown that the 
price difference may harm competition."" Given that our holding rests on the lack of underlying competition, we need not reach 
appellants' argument that Pulitzer had waived the question of competitive effects by failing to raise it in its motion for summary 
judgment. "
394,1," Throughout we use ""security"" to refer to concerns about hijacking and other crimes, and ""safety"" to refer to concerns about on-
board accidents, such as baggage falling from storage bins. "
395,2," The Association of Flight Attendants has testified before Congress, and filed an amicus brief in support of United and AMC, 
stating that oversized carry-on baggage constitutes a safety risk on board aircraft. The Association maintains that ""oversized 
[carry-on] baggage creates a myriad of difficulties to passenger and crew, ranging in seriousness from inconvenient delays to 
outright physical injury,"" that bin expansion has not been sufficient to alleviate these problems and that templates ""are the single 
most effective system available to airlines to control oversize carry-on baggage."" The Association states that in 1996 
approximately 3700 flight attendants employed by four carriers suffered injuries associated with carry-on baggage, and that each 
year, across all carriers, falling carry-on baggage reportedly injures approximately 4500 passengers. Because many injuries are 
not reported, the Association estimates that the total number of carry-on injuries is closer to 20,000 per year. "
396,3," The Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority (""MWAA""), created by a compact between the District of Columbia and the 
Commonwealth of Virginia, is the landlord of Dulles. A MWAA representative also attends AMC meetings but has no vote. 
United and AMC maintained that MWAA's authority to ""plan, establish, operate . . . and protect"" Dulles afford them state-action 
immunity. See  Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 351-52, 87 L. Ed. 315, 63 S. Ct. 307 (1943). For the reasons stated by the district 
court, we agree that ""the state-action doctrine does not insulate defendants' agreement."" Continental, 126 F. Supp. 2d at 986."
396,4," Less than 2% of the passengers flying out of Dulles fly Continental or Continental Express. Continental Airlines itself flies only a 
direct non-stop from Dulles to Houston. Those planes are used on three trips per day during the business week and two trips per 
day on weekends. Continental Express, which flies direct, non-stop flights to Cleveland and Newark only, does not use planes 
with expanded overhead bins, but allows planeside checking of luggage. "
398,5," Although we are ""mindful"" that United and AMC's ""version of any disputed issue of fact . . . is presumed correct,"" Eastman 
Kodak, 504 U.S. at 456, we have included above some facts that Continental proffers and United and AMC dispute in order to 
give the reader a better understanding of the issues in controversy. "
400,6," We recognize, of course, that summary judgment can be appropriate in antitrust cases. See  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. 
Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 582, 588, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986) (holding that summary judgment was 
properly granted after years of detailed discovery where plaintiffs' predatory-pricing theory was ""economically irrational and 
practically infeasible""). But ""HN14[
] legal presumptions that rest on formalistic distinctions rather than actual market realities 
are generally disfavored."" Eastman Kodak, 504 U.S. at 466-67. The Supreme Court has resisted the argument that such 
presumptions should replace factual findings, preferring to ""resolve antitrust claims on a case-by-case basis, focusing on the 
'particular facts disclosed by the record.'"" 504 U.S. at 467 (citing numerous cases). "
401,7," That both sides moved for summary judgment does not establish the absence of material factual disputes. HN15[
] Cross 
motions for summary judgment neither ""establish the propriety of deciding a case on summary judgment,"" Columbia Union 
College v. Clarke, 159 F.3d 151, 168 (4th Cir. 1998), nor ""establish that there is no issue of fact requiring that summary 
judgment be granted to one side or another."" Id., citing  World-Wide Rights Ltd. P'ship v. Combe, Inc., 955 F.2d 242, 244 (4th 
Cir. 1992) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)."
401,8," In fact, according to FAA commentary, airlines' carry-on programs are ""required to include at least one baggage control point 
located outside the airplane (but not located at the passenger security screening point)."" Carry-On Baggage Program, 52 Fed. 
Reg. at 21,473; see also 14 C.F.R. § 121.589(a) (noting requirement of ""an approved carry-on baggage program""); Carry-On

baggage-control point not at the checkpoint). Neither the FAA nor the parties attempt any explanation of this requirement; 
apparently, it mandates that each airline institute ""at least one baggage control point . . . outside the airplane"" that is not ""located 
at the passenger screening point,"" but does not prohibit additional ""baggage control points"" at the ""passenger screening points."" 
Thus, Continental does not contend that the FAA bars use of the templates at ""security screening points"" and we have found 
nothing in FAA regulations prohibiting this. Indeed, the FAA has apparently not opposed the installation of templates at security 
screening points in many airports throughout the country. "
402,9," We note that in Terminal Railroad Association, physical alternatives such as construction of another bridge were theoretically 
possible, but would apparently not have been economically efficient. See 13 Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law § 2221b1 
(1999) (noting ""great economies resulting from the fact that a single channel existed for bringing railroad traffic . . . into and 
through St. Louis""). Here, the nature and economic efficiency of a number of proposed alternatives to the template program may 
require resolution on remand. See Part IV. "
403,10," As for the medallions, the district court originally ruled that they provided no solution for ""low yield"" Continental passengers, 
and thus that Continental suffered antitrust injury despite the medallions. Continental, 126 F. Supp. 2d at 982-83. The court 
invited the defendants to ""seek reconsideration of [its] ruling"" if they cold produce evidence to the contrary.  126 F. Supp. 2d at 
982 n.53. United did seek reconsideration and offered evidence that the medallions were fully available to all passengers of any 
airline that wished to use them. The court never resolved the resulting factual dispute, but instead apparently concluded that in 
any event, medallions presented no solution, because passengers would have to wait at Continental's ticket counter to obtain 
the medallions. Continental II, 136 F. Supp. 2d at 551. The factual basis for this conclusion is unclear; the district court cites 
none and Continental refers only to a single affidavit of one of its managers, created after the district court issued its initial 
opinion. Given the sparseness of this evidence, we believe the district court erred in implicitly concluding as a matter of law that 
even if the medallions were available to all Continental passengers, Continental could not continue to provide its service. See id. "
406,1," Pursuant to the court's order, dated November 8, 2001, unsealing this memorandum and order, the court hereby re-issues this 
order, originally filed under seal on August 16, 2001, in redacted form. The redactions are indicated herein by dash marks, and 
appear at pages 23:5 and 25:13-15. "
407,2," The court re-issues the instant order, filed November 8, 2001, because it appears that in amending the original order filed 
under seal on August 16, 2001, certain lines were inadvertently omitted in the amended order, namely, line 3 on page 2 and the 
first three lines of footnote 2 of the original order. With the exception of the page references in footnote 1 above and the ordering 
of footnotes herein, in all other respects, this order is the same as that issued on November 8, 2001."
407,3," Sematech's motion to exclude the testimony of PSI's expert Alan J. Cox under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 
509 U.S. 579, 589, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993) is premature. The motion seeks an evidentiary ruling which the 
court entertains after it has heard all dispositive pretrial motions. Moreover, the motion is not appropriate in conjunction with the 
pending motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, the motion is summarily DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE, without further 
discussion."
407,4," The facts recited herein are taken from the parties' briefs and evidence submitted in conjunction with the pending motions. 
Where disputed, PSI's version of the facts are taken as true. The court overrules Sematech's objection to PSI's ""Statement of 
Undisputed Facts in Opposition to Sematech's Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the Alternative, Summary Adjudication,"" 
filed June 8, 2001. While PSI labeled the document a ""Statement of Undisputed Facts,"" it is actually a statement of ""disputed"" 
facts which is properly filed in opposition to a motion for summary judgment. E.D. Cal. L.R. 56-260(b)."
407,5," The court overrules Sematech's objection, filed June 8, 2001, to the Morris Declaration. Said declaration does not purport to 
offer ""expert testimony,"" either technical, economic, legal, or otherwise. Rather, it offers the lay opinion testimony of Mr. Morris 
based on his experience in the test wafer market; said testimony is properly considered. Alternatively, there are facts stated in 
the declaration which support that Mr. Morris may be qualified to testify as to some expert opinions. Additionally, the court does 
not rely on any portions of Mr. Morris' declaration which are argumentative or without foundation."
407,6," The present members of Sematech are: IBM, Intel, Motorola, Hewlett Packard, Advanced Microdevices, Texas Instruments, 
Phillips, TSMC, ST Microelectronics, Infinion Technology, Hynix, Conextent, and Agere Systems. See Pl.'s Opp'n to Def.'s MSJ, 
filed June 1, 2001 subject to protective order (""Opp'n to MSJ""), at 3 n. 4."
407,7," 15 U.S.C. § 4601 reads in relevant part: (a) Findings The Congress finds that it is in the national economic and security interests of the United States for the Department of 
Defense to provide financial assistance to the industry consortium known as Sematech for research and development 
activities in the field of semiconductor manufacturing technology. (b) Purposes "
408,," The purposes of this subchapter are- (1) to encourage the semiconductor industry in the United States- (A) to conduct research on advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques; and (B) to develop techniques to use manufacturing expertise for the manufacture of a variety of semiconductor 
products; and (2) in order to achieve the purpose set out in paragraph (1), to provide a grant program for the financial support of 
semiconductor research activities conducted by Sematech."
408,15, U.S.C. § 4601 (a) & (b).
408,8," The court overrules Sematech's objection, filed June 8, 2001, to the Brown Declaration. Said declaration properly authenticates 
the attached exhibits, the majority of which were authenticated at deposition."
408,9," PSI's claims do not involve the production of ""new"" semiconductor products by Sematech, i.e., so called ""cutting edge"" test 
wafers. Rather, its claims only involve test wafers which PSI and other private competitors could have made with commercially 
available equipment which they owned or which they could and would have acquired but for Sematech's participation in the 
market. "
409,10," Responding to a similar complaint by another test wafer company, Tactical Fabs, Inc., Sematach's Chris Sallee wrote, ""[U]nder 
SEMATECH's operating documents, we are legally prohibited from commercially selling semiconductor products solely for 
revenue."" Brown Decl. re: MSJ, Ex. 666. "
412,11," For the sake of brevity, the court omits from this discussion the extensive bickering contained in the parties' briefs as to who 
said what, and when. "
413,12," Cost Mgmt. Serv., Inc. v. Washington Natural Gas Co., 99 F.3d 937, 953 (9th Cir. 1996), relied on by Sematech, does not hold 
to the contrary. While the court in Cost Mgmt. reached a different result from the courts in Farley and Western Concrete, it did 
not prohibit a finding of ""predatory"" conduct based on a violation of law extrinsic to the antitrust laws. Rather, the court did not 
follow the holdings in Farley and Western Concrete because in Cost Mgmt., the plaintiff was not itself subject to the governing "
414,," tariff. As will be explained infra, here, PSI asserts violations of law which are applicable to both PSI and Sematech, and thus, the 
distinction drawn in Cost Mgmt. is not applicable. Moreover, the court notes the limited applicability of all three cases. The 
rationale for the decisions in Farley, Western Concrete, and Cost Mgmt. was based on the courts' findings that the facts in those 
cases presented claims closely analogous to traditional predatory pricing claims. Here, predatory pricing is not at issue. 
Therefore, the cases are not factually on point; however, the court relies on them in so far as they stand for the general 
proposition that a Section 2 violation may be shown by evidence of violation of laws extrinsic to the antitrust laws."
414,13," Such claim requires that the court address whether the asserted predicate offenses are ""forbidden by law."" Stop Youth 
Addition, Inc. v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 17 Cal. 4th 553, 560 (1998)."
414,14," It is Ms. Eggleston's expert opinion that (1) Sematech lost its tax-exempt status in 1996 when its mission changed from 
assisting the industry to assisting its member corporations; (2) Sematech's test wafer business constituted an ""unrelated trade or 
business activity"" which generated income which should have been (but was not) reported by Sematech and subjected to 
taxation; and (3) Sematech has failed to disclose on IRS Form 990 the existence of its commercial test wafer business. "
415,15," Sematech's expert, David Teece, disputes many of the findings made by PSI's expert, Alan Cox, set forth above. On a motion 
for summary judgment, the court cannot weigh the evidence presented by the parties. Here, the conflicting expert reports 
demonstrate that triable issues of fact remain for a jury. See Avery Dennison Corp. v. Acco Brands, Inc., 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
3938, 2000 WL 986995, *12 (C.D. Cal. 2000) (""In light of the [c]onflicting evidence and expert opinions, this Court may not weigh 
the evidence as presented by the parties. The inferences to be drawn from the parties' evidence could weigh in favor of either 
party."") "
416,16," In Rebel Oil, the court stated that the ""main sources of entry barriers are: (1) legal license requirements; (2) control of an 
essential or superior resource; (3) entrenched buyer preferences for established brands; (4) capital market evaluations imposing 
higher capitol costs on new entrants; and . . . (5) economies of scale."" 51 F.3d at 1439. "
419,17," The court rejects Sematech's ""judicial abstention"" argument as inapposite. The cases cited by Sematech each involve a 
highly-regulated industry (i.e., the insurance industry) and/or plaintiff had an alternative remedy that was either available or 
mandatory. See Def.'s MSJ at 32-34. In this case, the test wafer industry is not regulated whatsoever, and PSI has no other 
forum to redress its damages; accordingly, this court will decide the matter."
419,18," PSI conceded in its opposition that it does not have a UCL claim based on the NCRPA since the Act does not prohibit any 
conduct by Sematech. See Opp'n to MSJ at 37:20-22. The NCRPA simply confers certain benefits on research and production 
ventures that satisfy its terms, including a relaxed antitrust standard and single (not treble) damages if their activities are 
challenged under the antitrust laws. "
420,19," Norwest Mortgage, Inc. v. Sup. Ct., 72 Cal. App. 4th 214, 85 Cal. Rptr. 2d 18 (1999), relied on by Sematech, does not require 
a contrary holding. There, the question presented was whether a UCL action could be granted nationwide class certification 
when some of the actions complained of were performed out of state and effected out of state plaintiffs with no nexus to 
California. The court held that with respect to these claims only, the lack of any nexus to California made it inappropriate to apply 
the UCL. The court did not decide whether an out-of-state law could serve as a predicate for a UCL claim because no out-of-
state laws were involved."
420,20," Moreover, since this lawsuit was filed, Sematech amended its Certificate of Incorporation to state that the term ""semiconductor 
products"" means only finished chips. Falstad Aff., Ex. 3. While Sematech contends that the amendment was only a ""clarification"" 
of its charter, the trier of fact could treat the amendment as an admission that Sematech's sales of test wafers before the 
amendment were in violation of its charter. "
421,21," Section 3730(e)(4)(A) provides, ""No court shall have jurisdiction over an action . . . based upon the public disclosure of 
allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government 
Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, unless the action is brought by the Attorney 
General or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information."""
421,22," Mr. James Wilson was designated by UT as the person most knowledgeable about the lease between UT and Sematech and 
about Sematech's disclosures to UT about its test wafer business. "
423,23," After the hearing on Sematech's motions, the court permitted the parties to simultaneously file supplemental briefs to further 
address the issues raised at the hearing. The ""fraud"" prong of the UCL was not discussed at the hearing."
423,24," Sematech cites the Stutz case, which addresses whether the ""discovery rule"" applies to unfair competition claims. Stutz Motor 
Car of Am., Inc., v. Reebok Int'l, Ltd., 909 F. Supp. 1353, 1363-64 (9th Cir. 1995) . Stutz does not rule upon whether the 
""continuing violations"" doctrine applies to unfair competition claims. Moreover, although the Ninth Circuit has not directly decided 
this question, recent Ninth Circuit decisions have generously applied this equitable doctrine in many other contexts. In fact, at 
least one California district court has directly applied the continuing violations doctrine to an unfair competition claim. See Suh, 
987 F. Supp. at 796; see also Draper v. Coeur Rochester, Inc., 147 F.3d 1104, 1107 (9th Cir. 1998) (court applied the continuing 
violations doctrine to a Title VII claim); see also Gutowsky v. County of Placer, 108 F.3d 256, 259 (9th Cir. 1997) (court applied 
the continuing violations doctrine to a § 1983 action). "
425,25," Korea Supply is the first California case to squarely address the issue presented by this motion. The cases cited by both 
parties, though instructive of the issue generally, do not directly address the question presented here. See, e.g., Cortez v. 
Purolator Air Filtration Products Co., 23 Cal. 4th 163, 176, 96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 518, 999 P.2d 706 (2000) (the court expressly stated 
that it did not consider whether an award of back wages would be proper under a ""disgorgement of benefit theory"")."
425,26," Section 17203 states in relevant part, "
426,," The court may make such orders ... as may be necessary to prevent the use or employment by any person of any practice 
which constitutes unfair competition, . . . or as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any money or property, 
real or personal, which may have been acquired [*57]  by means of such unfair competition. Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17203 (emphasis added)."
426,27," In its reply, Sematech argues that should the court decide that PSI may proceed under the UCL pursuant to a ""disgorgement 
of benefits"" theory, it nonetheless seeks an order that PSI is not entitled to ""retitution"" under the UCL. See Def.'s Reply on Mot. 
for Sum. Adjud., filed under seal June 8, 2001, at 8:4-11. The court declines to make such a bright-line order. The relevant cases 
discuss ""disgorgement of profits"" as a form of ""retitutionary"" relief. See, e.g., ABC Int'l Traders, Inc. v. Matsushita Elec. Corp. of 
Am., 14 Cal. 4th 1247, 1268, 61 Cal. Rptr. 2d 112, 931 P.2d 290 (1997) (""on its face, section 17203 authorized injunctive relief to 
prevent unfair competition and/or restitution (i.e., disgorgement) of money or property wrongfully obtained""). Although this may 
not be technically true in some instances, the California Supreme Court recognized in Kraus that ""an order that a defendant 
disgorge money obtained through an unfair practice may include a restitutionary element, but is not so limited."" 23 Cal. 4th 127. 
Thus, some disgorgement orders may also classify as ""restitution"" orders, and it is not necessary to make a distinction between 
the two theories of recovery when plaintiff is entitled to either type of relief under the UCL. Moreover, it is worth noting that PSI 
has expressly stated that it is not seeking ""restitution"" as that term is defined by Sematech but rather seeks relief under the UCL 
under a ""disgorgement of benefits"" theory. See Pl.'s Opp'n to Mot. for Sum. Adjud., filed June 1, 2001 subject to protective order 
(""Opp'n re: Sum. Adjud.""), at 6:4-6."
426,28," PSI only seeks to disgorge ""that portion of Sematech's illicit profits that are proportionate to PSI's share of the test wafer 
market,"" had Sematech not engaged in unfair competition. See Opp'n re: Sum. Adjud. at 8:16-19. "
434,1," GlaxoSmithKline has filed motions adopting the grounds raised by Bayer and has adopted Bayer's briefs rather than submitting 
separate briefs. "
445,1," The complaint refers to several entities, including GEMicroGen, Inc. and Plug Power, Inc., as well as the Defendants. The 
complaint does not set forth the alleged relationships among all of the entities. "
446,2," GEFCS disputes this, stating that havePOWER knew Robertson was not authorized to bind GEFCS and the $ 750,000 check 
was never negotiated by GEFCS, which is evidence that the deal was not complete. Further, GEFCS asserts that even if they "
447,," were entitled to rely on Robertson's representation, that reliance was improper after August 29, based on a August 30 e-mail 
from havePOWER to GEFCS, referencing a conversation the previous day."
447,3," GEFCS asserts that it offered a non-exclusive distributorship to havePOWER, but it rejected that arrangement. "
448,4," HN7[
] Maryland's Antitrust Act, states in § 11-202(a)(2) that the General Assembly intended that this state statute be interpreted by courts consistently with the federal courts' interpretation of federal antitrust statutes. Therefore, this court shall first 
look to the federal standards. See also  Montgomery County Ass'n of Realtors v. Realty Photo Master Corp., 878 F. Supp. 804 
(D.Md. (1995). "
462,1," Minn. Stat. §§ 325D.13 (the Unfair Trade Practices Act), 325F.69 (the Prevention of Consumer Fraud Act), and 325D.13 (the 
False Statement in Advertising Act)."
462,2, Minn. Stat. § 325D.49-.69. 
463,3," Because the Court rules in favor of Defendants based on these arguments, it need not consider the merits of Defendants' 
remaining arguments that Plaintiffs' claims are preempted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, 15 U.S.C. § 
1331, et seq., that Plaintiffs have failed to prove an antitrust injury, and that Plaintiffs proposed proof of causation, injury, and 
damages would violate due process and Defendants' right to a jury trial."
463,4," In any event, the Lanham Act cases cited in footnote 11 of Group Health do not support Plaintiffs' sweeping proposition that 
causation should be HN5[
] presumed in all consumer fraud cases where a defendant acts intentionally to deceive. Such a 
presumption does not apply in Lanham Act cases involving ""general grievances"" about a defendant's advertising because the 
result would be to give each plaintiff ""a windfall unrelated to its own damage."" Heidi Ott A.G. v. Target Corp., 153 F. Supp. 2d 
1055, 1073 (D. Minn. 2001) (quoting Porous Media Corp v. Pall Corp., 110 F.3d 1329, 1334 (8th Cir. 1997) (""Where a defendant 
is guilty of misrepresenting its own product without targeting any other specific product, it is erroneous to apply a rebuttable 
presumption of harm in favor of a [plaintiff]."")); see also  Balance Dynamics Corp. v. Schmitt Indus., Inc., 204 F.3d 683, 694 (6th 
Cir. 2000) (stating that ""the presumptive damages rule [extends] only to cases of comparative advertising where the plaintiff's 
product was specifically targeted""). "
466,5," Contrary to Plaintiffs' contention, HN15[
] it is appropriate to consider the admissibility of expert witness testimony during 
summary judgment. Additionally, if the expert testimony is inadmissible and the non-moving party is unable to generate a 
genuine issue of material fact without such testimony, it is appropriate to grant summary judgment. See, e.g.,  Giles v. Miners, 
Inc., 242 F.3d 810, 813 (8th Cir. 2001) (affirming summary judgment where testimony of plaintiffs' expert was inadmissible under 
Daubert);  Peitzmeier v. Hennessy Indus., Inc., Free. Ch. 1020, 97 F.3d 293, 297-99 (8th Cir. 1996) (same); Cipollone v. Yale 
Indus. Prods., Inc., 202 F.3d 376, 379-380 (1st Cir. 2000) (same)."
466,6," Plaintiffs also claim that Dr. Glenn Harrison has calculated damages in this case; however, this claim is undermined by Dr. 
Harrison's expert report which explicitly states that he does not calculate damages caused by Defendants' alleged misconduct. 
(See Bulinski Aff., Ex. D at 5.) Dr. Harrison, in fact, points to Dr. Harris as the witness who links Defendants' alleged wrongdoing 
to Plaintiffs' claimed damages. (See id.) "
480,1," In addition to the NBA team Defendants, the NBA franchise teams operate under the following names: Boston Celtics, Miami 
Heat, New Jersey Nets, Orlando Magic, Philadelphia 76ers, Washington Wizards, Atlanta Hawks, Charlotte Hornets, Cleveland 
Cavaliers, Detroit Pistons, Indiana Pacers, Milwaukee Bucks, Toronto Raptors, Dallas Mavericks, Denver Nuggets, Houston 
Rockets, Minnesota Timberwolves, San Antonio Spurs, Vancouver Grizzlies, Golden State Warriors, Phoenix Suns, and Seattle 
SuperSonics. (FAC P 49.) "
481,2," The Court notes that the FAC alleges ""Defendant iN Demand"" in its factual background section, (see FAC P 66), but does not 
list iN Demand as a Defendant in the section listing the Defendants to this action. (See FAC PP 8-20.) Insofar as the FAC 
purports to add iN Demand as a Defendant, its efforts are not well taken. By order dated June 18, 2001, this Court allowed 
Plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint, but specifically stated that they could not add iN Demand as a Defendant because they 
had unequivocally asserted in their briefs that they were not seeking to add new defendants, but only new plaintiffs. (June 18, 
2001, Order at 26 n.5, 30-31.) "
482,3," Unless otherwise noted, all future citations to ""Section"" reference the Sherman Act."
482,4," All future citations to ""Rule"" reference the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. "
484,5," HN10[
] Vertical agreements fixing maximum resale prices, and vertical restraints not involving price fixing are generally 
analyzed under the rule of reason test. Electronics Communications, 129 F.3d at 243; 1 Julian O. von Kalinowski et al., Antitrust 
Laws and Trade Regulation § 18.02[3] at 18-9 (2d ed. 2000). "
488,6," Insofar as Plaintiffs now contend that they have properly alleged a theory of output restrictions because satellite users must 
purchase the NBA League Pass on an all-or-nothing basis, that theory fails because Plaintiffs waived this argument in their 
opposition to DirecTV's motion to dismiss the original complaint where they stated they were not alleging the bundled nature of 
the NBA League Pass is an illegal tying arrangement. (Plts' Oppo to DirecTV's Mtn. to Dismiss Complaint or in the Alternative, to 
Compel Arbitration at 4-5 (arguing that their claim is for price fixing and not based on a tying theory).)"
488,7," NBA OTA Games ""are defined as and include all NBA Games (other than playoff games) licensed by a team for distribution by 
broadcast television."" (Mishkin Decl. Exh. A-14; Williams Decl. Exh. A at 13.)"
488,8," RSN NBA Games ""are defined as and include NBA Games (other than playoff games) licensed by a team for distribution by 
non-broadcast television technology."" (Mishkin Decl. Exh. A-14; Williams Decl. Exh. A at 13.)"
488,9," Section 1(a)(iii) of the contract states that DirecTV is authorized, as part of DirecTV's regular carriage of the programming of 
any regional sports network (""RSN"") ""pursuant to DIRECTV's agreement with such RSN, to deliver any NBA Games distributed 
by such RSN in the applicable Home Market . . . or, where applicable, the RSN market of the NBA team with which such RSN 
has a then-current television license agreement."" (Mishkin Decl. Exh. A-7; Williams Decl. Exh. A at 6.) DirecTV is also authorized 
to distribute to its subscribers who are authorized to receive the programming of an RSN, retelecasts of regular season NBA 
Games that are distributed by such RSN as part of that RSN's regularly scheduled programming in the applicable Home Market. 
(Mishkin Decl. Exh. A-7; Williams Decl. Exh. A at 6.)"
488,10," Section 1(h) of the contract provides that ""with respect to any NBA team that, for any reason, does not distribute telecasts of 
NBA games in which it participates via an RSN within its Home Market, and that desires to distribute some of such NBA Games 
via DIRECTV within its Home Market, DIRECTV shall in good faith consider making available to such team a distribution 
package of such team's NBA Games to DIRECTV Subscribers located in that team's Home Market or, at NBA's sole discretion, 
to Subscribers located in that team's RSN Market, subject in either instance to then-current NBA rules regarding game telecast 
distribution and the terms of Section 1(d)(iii) above . . . ."" (Mishkin Decl. Exh. A-34; Williams Decl. Exh. A at 33.) "
491,11," It is further questionable whether the NBA-DirecTV distributorship is in fact exclusive in light of the FAC's allegations that NBA 
has also contracted with iN Demand to provide the NBA League Pass to cable subscribers on a pay-per-view basis. (See FAC P 
66.) Plaintiffs argue that the relevant market is the NBA League Pass for satellite viewing, and that there is no real competition 
between satellite and cable. Because the FAC's allegations are conclusory, it is unnecessary for this Court to determine whether 
the availability of the NBA League Pass through cable renders the NBA-DirecTV contract non-exclusive. "
493,12," Plaintiffs also argue that a third exception to Illinois Brick is a state law remedy. Plaintiffs are correct. California v. ARC 
America, 490 U.S. 93, 101-02, 104 L. Ed. 2d 86, 109 S. Ct. 1661 (1989). However, this exception is relevant only to Plaintiffs' 
state law causes of action, and do not support a horizontal conspiracy claim against the NBA Defendants under the Sherman 
Act. "
507,1," See Plaintiffs' Representative Samples of Plaintiffs' Trademark Registrations for Classes 12 and 27, filed under separate cover 
and denoted document 139."
507,2," During Levine's deposition, Plaintiffs' attorney marked as Exhibit 1006 a number of pages that Defendant produced in discovery 
that includes reproductions of Plaintiffs' trademarks. Exhibit 1006 to Levine's deposition is attached as Exhibit 7 to Plaintiffs' brief 
in support of its Motion for Summary Judgment."
507,3," Defendant's applications to Ford in April of 1995 and May of 1998 to become a licensee were both denied. (Plt's Br., Ex. 15)."
507,4," Indeed, a Stylin' Concepts catalog described Defendant's Mats as being ""Ford approved."" (Plt's Br., Ex. 12). However, the 
owner of the catalog, John Milos, explained that that representation was the result of a computer and proofreading error on the 
part of the catalog company. (Milos Declaration at PP3-4). "
508,5," Plaintiffs also alleged trademark infringement under the common law, but did not provide the Court with much guidance on the 
common law version. Since the Court will grant Plaintiffs the injunctive relief they request due to Defendant's violations of §§ 
1114 and 1125(a) and (c), analysis of Plaintiffs' common law trademark infringement claim does not appear to be a fruitful 
exercise. "
510,6," As will be discussed infra., Defendant relies heavily on Plasticolor Molded Products v. Ford Motor Co., 713 F. Supp. 1329, 
1339 (C.D.Cal. 1989). That opinion described mats bearing Plaintiffs' trademarks as contributing ""to a harmonious ensemble of 
accessories and decorating the interior of a car."" Id. at 1335. "
511,7," Defendant's counsel stated, ""The product itself is designed to blend into the vehicle and create this pride . . . ."" (Plt's Br., Ex. 6 
at 25). "
512,8," Moreover, as will be discussed infra., the Court rejects Defendant's arguments that Plaintiffs' trademarks are functional and that 
its disclaimers effectively eliminate any likelihood of confusion. "
515,9," The Court furthermore finds Defendant's claim regarding the quality of its floor mats to be unavailing because, ""HN24[
] 
today, the overwhelming majority view is that it is not necessary for plaintiff to prove that the defendant's non-competing goods 
are of inferior quality."" McCarthy at § 24:15. According to McCarthy, courts reason that they are ill-equipped to judge the 
respective quality of the goods. Additionally, the infringer's quality may decline in the future. As a consequence, a finding in favor 
of a defendant due to the high quality of its product at the time of the litigation would place the plaintiff's reputation in the hands 
of a competitor over whom the plaintiff has no control. Id. Also see  Mobil Oil Corp. v. Pegasus Petroleum Corp., 818 F.2d 254, 
259-260; 818 F.2d 254, 2 U.S.P.Q.2d 1677 (2nd Cir. 1987)(""[A] senior user may sue to protect his reputation even where the 
infringer's goods are of top quality.""). "
521,10," This conclusion applies equally to dealerships owned by Ford Investment Enterprises Corporation, which is a subsidiary of 
Ford Motor Company. There is no evidence that Ford licensed its subsidiary to use Plaintiffs' trademarks as it chooses. "
524,1, All further unspecified code sections refer to the Business and Professions Code. 
525,2," The facts, which we accept as true for the purposes of this appeal, are set forth as alleged in the second amended complaint 
(SAC), the operative complaint. "
526,3, Appellants did not allege this cause of action against DESCO. 
527,4," We denied without prejudice Respondents' motion to consolidate this appeal with an appeal by Brock, Easley, Inc. (A092386) 
against them. Since the operative complaints in these appeals are not identical, we decline to consolidate the appeals. "
528,5," In addition, Appellants allege in their SAC that Respondents' illegal actions put Bylin, a California corporation that 
manufactured SHRT, out of business. "
529,6," Section 16720 provides: ""A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more persons for any of the following 
purposes: [P] (a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce. [P] (b) To limit or reduce the production, or increase 
the price of merchandise or of any commodity. [P] (c) To prevent competition in manufacturing, making, transportation, sale or 
purchase of merchandise, produce or any commodity. [P] (d) To fix at any standard or figure, whereby its price to the public or 
consumer shall be in any manner controlled or established, any article or commodity of merchandise, produce or commerce 
intended for sale, barter, use or consumption in this State. [P] (e) To make or enter into or execute or carry out any contracts, 
obligations or agreements of any kind or description, by which they do all or any or any combination of any of the following: [P] 
(1) Bind themselves not to sell, dispose of or transport any article or any commodity or any article of trade, use, merchandise, 
commerce or consumption below a common standard figure, or fixed value. [P] (2) Agree in any manner to keep the price of 
such article, commodity or transportation at a fixed or graduated figure. [P] (3) Establish or settle the price of any article, 
commodity or transportation between them or themselves and others, so as directly or indirectly to preclude a free and 
unrestricted competition among themselves, or any purchasers or consumers in the sale or transportation of any such article or 
commodity. [P] (4) Agree to pool, combine or directly or indirectly unite any interests that they may have connected with the sale 
or transportation of any such article or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected."" "
531,7," We note that the Freeman court merely observed that California courts frequently examine federal precedent because the 
language and purpose of the Cartwright Act resemble those of the Sherman Act, but it also cautioned that their language and 
purpose were not ""coextensive."" (Ibid.) "
532,8," The Supreme Court considered a challenged merger and held that the Cartwright Act does not cover mergers. ( Id. at pp. 
1164-1165.) "
533,9," Section 17203 provides: ""Any person who engages, has engaged, or proposes to engage in unfair competition may be 
enjoined in any court of competent jurisdiction. The court may make such orders or judgments, including the appointment of a 
receiver, as may be necessary to prevent the use or employment by any person of any practice which constitutes unfair 
competition, as defined in this chapter, or as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any money or property, real 
or personal, which may have been acquired by means of such unfair competition."""
533,10," The court sustained without leave to amend DESCO's demurrer to this claim in the first amended complaint. Appellants do not 
challenge this ruling in their briefs, and we therefore only consider this allegation as it concerns Raychem. "
534,11," At oral argument, for the first time, Appellants asserted that this statute could not be waived. They provided no authority for 
this position nor did they allege this in their SAC."
534,12," Section 20015 provides: ""The provisions of this chapter apply to any franchise where either the franchisee is domiciled in this 
state or the franchised business is or has been operated in this state."""
534,13, We express no opinion as to whether such a claim is possible.
534,14, Appellants acknowledge in their reply brief that this claim against DESCO has been abandoned. 
541,1," Individually and on behalf of others similarly situated. The plaintiff's claims were filed as a class action lawsuit pursuant to

550,3," Indirect purchasers are persons who buy products not directly from their original source but from other parties further down the 
distribution chain. See Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 726, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707, 97 S. Ct. 2061 (1977)."
550,4," These vitamin products include: (1) specific vitamins (vitamins A, B, B2, B3, B4, B5, C, E, and beta carotene); (2) vitamin 
premixes (a blend of several vitamins and other products in either dry or spray-on applications); and (3) products containing 
vitamins and vitamin premixes (vitamin supplements, milk, bread, cereal, juice, beverage powders, eggs, meat, fish, poultry, 
pork products, pasta, flour, rice, baby food, baby formula, pet food, and cosmetics)."
550,5," This case is one small part of nationwide litigation against the defendants for price-fixing and other anticompetitive conduct. A 
class action lawsuit was filed on September 30, 1998, in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and then in twenty-two 
other jurisdictions (not including Massachusetts), asserting claims on behalf of businesses and consumers who had indirectly 
purchased vitamin products manufactured by one or more of the defendants. Several of the defendants pleaded guilty to Federal 
antitrust charges, and they entered into a master settlement agreement to resolve all class and parens patriae litigation."
550,6," Several defendants sought to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint for lack of adequate notice pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(1), 
365 Mass. 749 (1974), and for failure to allege fraudulent concealment with sufficient particularity pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 
9(b), 365 Mass. 751 (1974). The judge denied those motions, and the defendants have taken no further action on those claims. 
Several defendants also sought to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 
12(b)(2), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). These motions were not addressed by the judge pursuant to agreement by the parties."
550,7," We acknowledge the amicus briefs filed by Microsoft Corporation; the National Consumer Law Center; the New England Legal 
Foundation; and the Attorney General on behalf of the Commonwealth."
550,8," The defendants F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd.; Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc.; and Roche Vitamins, Inc., control approximately 40% 
of the relevant world vitamin market. The defendants BASF, A.G., and BASF Corporation control approximately 20% of that 
market. The defendants Rhone-Poulenc S.A., Rhone-Poulenc Animal Nutrition, Inc.; and Rhone-Poulenc, Inc., control 
approximately 15% of the market. "
551,9," Federal antitrust law includes: (1) the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1 (2000) (making illegal ""HN6[
] every contract, combination 
in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign 
nations . . .""); and (2) the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15 (2000) (authorizing civil actions by any person ""HN7[
] injured in his 
business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws"")."
551,10," In reaching this conclusion, the Supreme Court specifically declined to modify its prior decision in Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United 
Shoe Mach. Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231, 88 S. Ct. 2224 (1968). See Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 736-
747, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707, 97 S. Ct. 2061 (1977). In that case, the Supreme Court held that the victim of an overcharge was 
damaged within the meaning of § 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15, and that the defendant could not introduce evidence that 
the purchaser had ""passed on"" the overcharge to its own customers, thereby sustaining no injury.  Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United "
552,," Shoe Mach. Corp., 392 U.S. at 488-494. In considering whether to allow the indirect purchasers to maintain a cause of action 
against the anticompetitive actors, the Supreme Court would have had to modify its holding in Hanover Shoe because to do 
otherwise would have permitted multiple recoveries of the same damages, once by the direct purchasers and again by the 
indirect purchasers. Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. at 728-735. The Supreme Court rejected a proposed modification of 
Hanover Shoe based on considerations of stare decisis and for reasons of public policy.  431 U.S. at 736-746."
552,11," In contrast, the Antitrust Act only regulates trade or commerce that ""HN15[
] directly and substantially affects the people of the commonwealth"" (emphasis added). See G. L. c. 93, §§ 2, 4."
552,12," Section 45(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act states: ""HN18[
] Unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, are hereby declared unlawful."" 15 U.S.C. § 
45(a)(1) (2000). "
553,13," Several of these cases also include language stating that price-fixing constitutes an unfair practice in violation of the FTC Act. 
This is a distinction without a difference in the present case because G. L. c. 93A, § 2, prohibits both ""HN20[
] unfair methods 
of competition"" and ""unfair or deceptive acts or practices."""
553,14," The broad scope of G. L. c. 93A is evidenced by the fact that it encompasses claims where a plaintiff's damages are de 
minimis. See Leardi v. Brown, 394 Mass. 151, 157-163, 474 N.E.2d 1094 (1985) (tenants could bring action under G. L. c. 93A 
for inclusion of illegal term in lease, even where tenants suffered no actual harm, because mere invasion of legal right to 
habitable premises constituted injury). See also Clegg v. Butler, 424 Mass. 413, 418, 676 N.E.2d 1134 (1997) (third-party 
claimants could bring actions against liability insurers who violated G. L. c. 93A by invading their legally protected interests)."
553,15," Following the Supreme Court's decision in Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, supra, some States enacted so-called Illinois Brick 
repealer statutes to permit damages actions by or on behalf of indirect purchasers. See, e.g., Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 16750 (a) 
(Deering 1992); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, § 1104 (West 1997); N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 340 (6) (McKinney Supp. 2002); R.I. Gen. 
Laws § 6-36-12 (g) (2001); Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 9, § 2465 (b) (Supp. 2001). For a discussion on State responses to Illinois Brick Co. 
v. Illinois, supra, see O'Connor, Is the Illinois Brick Wall Crumbling?, 15 Antitrust 34, 35 (Summer 2001) (noting that thirty-six 
States and District of Columbia, representing over seventy per cent of the nation's population, now provide for some sort of right 
of action on behalf of some or all indirect purchasers). The defendants contend that the fact that the Legislature declined to 
enact such legislation in Massachusetts, as proposed on several occasions by the Attorney General, suggests an intent not to 
recognize causes of action by indirect purchasers. See 1985 Senate Doc. No. 1071; 1986 Senate Doc. No. 1033; 1987 House 
Doc. No. 4104; 1990 Senate Doc. No. 101; 1991 Senate Doc. No. 1579; 1992 Senate Doc. No. 1563; 1993 Senate Doc. No. 
120; 1994 Senate Doc. No. 82. However, HN23[
] no inference is possible from this negative history. ""The fallacy in the 
argument is that no one knows why the legislature did not pass the proposed measure[]. . . . The practicalities of the legislative 
process furnish many reasons for the lack of success of a measure other than legislative dislike for the principle involved in the 
legislation."" Franklin v. Albert, 381 Mass. 611, 615-616, 411 N.E.2d 458 (1980), quoting Berry v. Branner, 245 Ore. 307, 311, 
421 P.2d 996 (1966). One such reason is the ""belief that the matter should be left to be handled by the normal processes of "
554,," judicial development of decisional law, including the overruling of outstanding decisions to the extent that the sound growth of 
the law requires."" Franklin v. Albert, supra at 616, quoting H. Hart & A. Sacks, The Legal Process: Basic Problems in the Making 
and Application of Law 1395-1396 (tent. ed. 1958). Moreover, the proposed bills, if enacted, would have modified the Antitrust 
Act, not G. L. c. 93A."
554,16," While the plaintiff has alleged in her complaint that the defendants entered into a conspiracy in illegal restraint or monopoly of 
trade, she also alleged that the defendants' price-fixing conspiracy constituted ""unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices within 
the meaning of G. L. c. 93A, § 2."""
554,17," The premise of the dissent is that the court's interpretation of G. L. c. 93A, § 9, in relation to G. L. c. 93, results in 
contradictions and unreasonable consequences. There are no such contradictions or unreasonable consequences. The absence 
of any legislative enactment limiting the application of G. L. c. 93A, § 9, in claims involving antitrust allegations clearly signifies, 
under the mandate of G. L. c. 93, § 14A, that G. L. c. 93 has no effect on G. L. c. 93A, § 9. The dissent states that, ""while 
inserting the word 'method' in § 9(1), the Legislature conspicuously failed to add it to the class action provisions of § 9(2). . . . If 
the Legislature intended to allow indirect purchaser consumers to bring claims for antitrust violations, it is anomalous in the 
extreme that the Legislature would exclude such claims from the class action mechanism of § 9(2)."" Post at . There are two 
responses. First, HN28[
] antitrust violations are actionable under G. L. c. 93A, § 9(1), not only because they are unfair methods of competition, but also because they constitute unfair acts or practices, supra at, and because the Legislature did not 
explicitly preclude antitrust activity as a violation of § 9(1). Second, assuming that the omission of the word ""method"" from G. L. 
c. 93A, § 9(2), precludes a class action thereunder, as the dissent suggests (the question is not before us: no class has yet been 
certified), it does not follow that an inability to bring a class action under § 9(2) precludes an individual claim under § 9(1). 
Nevertheless, HN29[
] a class action may be brought under G. L. c. 93A, § 9(2), for unfair acts or practices, including antitrust violations. Additionally, § 9(2), enacted in 1969, before the adoption of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, does not 
preclude a class action for unfair methods of competition pursuant to the more burdensome provisions of Mass. R. Civ. P. 23. 
See Fletcher v. Cape Cod Gas Co., 394 Mass. 595, 477 N.E.2d 116 (1985); Baldassari v. Public Fin. Trust, 369 Mass. 33, 40-
41, 337 N.E.2d 701 (1975). "
555,18," In light of our conclusion that G. L. c. 93A allows indirect purchasers to bring a cause of action for anticompetitive conduct that 
would be precluded under the Antitrust Act, the defendants' argument that the plaintiff could not be ""injured"" within the meaning 
of G. L. c. 93A, § 9, because she is not ""injured"" under the Antitrust Act is without merit. The court in Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 
supra 431 U.S. at 746-747, did not conclude that indirect purchasers were not injured by illegal overcharges passed on by direct 
purchasers. Rather, it concluded that indirect purchasers should not be permitted to pursue damages claims for such injuries 
because of the burdens that such lawsuits would place on the judicial system and because limiting recovery to direct purchasers 
was a more efficient means of making antitrust violators pay for their illegal acts given the small stakes of indirect purchasers in 
these lawsuits.  Id. at 431 U.S. 736-747. "
556,19," The dissent suggests that it ""makes no sense . . . to [permit both direct and indirect purchasers to bring suit] in the same State 
court system."" Post at . We are not persuaded that permitting only direct purchasers to bring a cause of action and retain as 
damages the amount that they passed along to indirect purchasers, something that the dissent recognizes as a windfall at the 
expense of the true victims further down the distribution chain, is the correct result. Id."
556,20," Some of the perceived difficulty in calculating and apportioning damages between direct and indirect purchasers was obviated 
by the Massachusetts Legislature when it included language in HN33[
]  G. L. c. 93A, § 9(3), allowing consumers who prevailed on claims of unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or 
commerce to recover actual damages or twenty-five dollars, whichever was greater. To the extent that the plaintiff is able to 
prevail on the issue of liability but is unable to prove actual damages, the Legislature has decided that she is entitled to a 
specified remedy. See Whyte v. Connecticut Mut. Life Ins. Co., 818 F.2d 1005, 1012 (1st Cir. 1987); Leardi v. Brown, 394 Mass. 
151, 160, 474 N.E.2d 1094 (1985)."
556,21," HN34[
] The Attorney General has both a common-law duty and a specific statutory mandate to protect the public interest 
and enforce public rights. See Commonwealth v. Mass. CRINC, 392 Mass. 79, 88, 466 N.E.2d 792 (1984). See also G. L. c. 
93A, §§ 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Nothing in this opinion should be construed as limiting the Attorney General's powers and remedies 
under G. L. c. 93A to seek redress for indirect purchasers for unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or 
practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce. "
558,1," In that original version, G. L. c. 93A conferred no private right of action but instead lodged all enforcement and remedial powers 
exclusively in the Attorney General. This approach was consistent with the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(1), 
which still lodges enforcement authority only in the Federal Trade Commission and creates no private right of action. See 
Holloway v. Bristol-Myers Corp., 158 U.S. App. D.C. 207, 485 F.2d 986, 988 (D.C. Cir. 1973)."
558,2," The author of the article was one of the principal draftsmen of St. 1969, c. 690. Rice, New Private Remedies for Consumers: 
The Amendment of Chapter 93A, 54 Mass. L.Q. 307, 307 n.* (1969). "
559,3," By comparison, the consumer private action in G. L. c. 93A, § 9, which did not then include a remedy for ""unfair methods of 
competition,"" contained no cross-reference to the Massachusetts Antitrust Act. "
560,4," By comparison, the class action provisions of G. L. c. 93A, § 11, expressly allow such actions ""if the use or employment of the 
unfair method of competition or the unfair or deceptive act or practice has caused similar injury to numerous other persons 
similarly situated"" (emphasis added)."
560,5," Until the Supreme Court's decision ten years later in California v. ARC Am. Corp., 490 U.S. 93, 103-105, 104 L. Ed. 2d 86, 109 
S. Ct. 1661 (1989), it was not even clear that the States would be permitted to deviate from Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 
720, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707, 97 S. Ct. 2061 (1977) (Illinois Brick)."
560,6," For example, the multiple damages provisions are quite different. Compare G. L. c. 93, § 12 (court may, but is not required, to 
award up to treble actual damages if antitrust violation was perpetrated ""with malicious intent to injure"" plaintiff), with G. L. c. 
93A, § 11 (court must award at least double damages if defendant's violation of § 2 was ""willful or knowing""). Similarly, while G. 
L. c. 93A, § 11, provides a procedural mechanism whereby a defendant may tender a reasonable settlement offer in its answer 
and thereby avoid liability for multiple damages, no such mechanism exists for actions brought under G. L. c. 93. Antitrust claims 
under G. L. c. 93, § 12, must be brought in the Superior Court, while claims under G. L. c. 93A, § 11, can be brought in either the 
Superior Court or the District Court. Thus, G. L. c. 93, § 14A, operates to prevent any blurring of an assortment of technical, "
561,," procedural, and remedial distinctions between the two statutes, while G. L. c. 93A, § 11, announces that both statutes will follow 
the same basic principles of antitrust law."
561,7," See 1981 House Doc. No. 5416; 1985 Senate Doc. No. 1071; 1986 Senate Doc. No. 1033; 1987 House Doc. No. 4104; 1990 
Senate Doc. No. 101; 1991 Senate Doc. No. 1579; 1992 Senate Doc. No. 1563; 1993 Senate Doc. No. 120; 1994 Senate Doc. 
No. 82. "
562,8," Indeed, the tracing exercise could ultimately show that, due to either contract commitments or market forces, entities higher up 
in the distribution chain were unable to pass on the increased prices, such that those increased prices never filtered all the way 
down to the consumer level."
562,9," We must also invent some method of preventing the imposition of multiple liability. Antitrust defendants will, under G. L. c. 93, § 
12, and Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231, 88 S. Ct. 2224 (1968) (Hanover 
Shoe), be liable to direct purchasers for the full amount of whatever inflated price resulted from the violation, without any 
reduction for the amount by which the direct purchaser passed on that inflated price to others. When an indirect purchaser 
consumer then claims that she has been injured because those same increased prices were passed down to her, she will be 
seeking to have the violator pay again for damages it has already paid in full. Not surprisingly, most of the State Legislatures that have rejected Illinois Brick have simultaneously adopted provisions to 
address this multiple liability problem. Several States have effectively repealed Hanover Shoe along with Illinois Brick, allowing a 
defendant to defend on the ground that the plaintiff passed the overcharge on to others. See Haw. Rev. Stat. § 480-13(c)(2) 
(1993 & Supp. 2000); N.M. Stat. Ann. § 57-1-3(C) (2000); N.Y. Gen. Bus. § 340(6) (McKinney Supp. 2002); N.D. Cent. Code § 
51-08.1-08 (1999). Others allow a setoff for amounts that the defendant has already paid to victims higher up the chain. See 
Idaho Code § 48-108(2)(a) (Supp. 2000); R.I. Gen. Laws § 6-36-12(a)(1) (2001); Wis. Stat. Ann. § 133.18(1)(a) (2001). Other 
States provide for transfer and consolidation of actions so that problems of multiple liability and duplicate recovery may be 
avoided at the outset. See D.C. Code Ann. § 28-4509(c) (2001); 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. § 10/7(2) (2001); Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 9, § 
2465(b) (Supp. 2001). Finally, others simply authorize the court to ""take any steps necessary to avoid duplicative recovery 
against a defendant."" Minn. Stat. Ann. § 325D.57 (2000).  S.D. Codified Laws § 37-1-33 (2000). That our Legislature has done 
nothing to address the problem of multiple liability is one more reason to conclude that the 1979 amendments to G. L. c. 93A, § 
9 (1), were not intended to repeal Illinois Brick. In the wake of today's opinion, we will have to craft a judicial solution to this 
problem with no legislative guidance, and, by definition, any solution we craft will be contrary to the unambiguous adoption of 
Federal antitrust principles in G. L. c. 93, § 1. "
567,1," Neither party offers a copy of plaintiff's DFEH claim or the DFEH's response thereto. Plaintiff, in his Objection to Defendant 
Avemco Insurance Company's Separate Statement of Undisputed Facts, does not dispute that he filed a claim with the DFEH on 
July 7, 1999 or that the DFEH closed the case on December 22, 1999. "
568,2," Neither party has filed a copy of the claim plaintiff filed with the Department of Justice nor provided any evidence as to when 
that claim was filed. "
569,3," Defendant also relies on Walker v. Allstate Indemnity Co., 77 Cal. App. 4th 750 (2000). Walker likewise is distinguishable. In 
Walker, the court held that the plaintiffs' suit challenging allegedly excessive insurance rates under the Unfair Practices Act was 
barred by California Insurance Code §§ 1860.1 and 1860.2, where those rates had been approved by the Insurance 
Commissioner. Rather, the plaintiffs, according to Walker, were limited to filing a petition for a writ of administrative mandamus 
to review the Commissioner's decision. See id. at 753-54. The instant action, by contrast, does not involve a challenge to the 
Insurance Commissioner's ratemaking decisions."
569,4," The Court has previously determined that it has diversity jurisdiction over plaintiff's claims. (See Order Denying Plaintiff's 
Motion to Remand, filed May 11, 2001.) "
570,5," Defendant does not argue that plaintiff lacks standing to seek relief under § 125.6. In light of the Court's finding, discussed 
infra, that any claim under § 125.6 is barred by the statute of limitations, the Court does not consider whether plaintiff, as a 
private party, has standing to bring an action pursuant to § 125.6."
570,6," In its motion, defendant indicates that it has construed plaintiff's Fourth Cause of Action as claiming a violation of the Cartwright 
Act. In his opposition, plaintiff does not take issue with that characterization. "
571,7," The DFEH and the FEHC are both part of the same ""agency,"" the State and Consumer Services Agency. See Cal. Gov't Code 
§§ 12901, 12903."
571,8," Although plaintiff also filed an administrative claim with the Department of Justice, plaintiff offers no evidence as to when that 
claim was filed, nor does plaintiff rely on that claim to establish equitable tolling. "

] In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court may examine facts stated in the complaint, documents attached to the complaint as exhibits, and documents incorporated by reference. See  Yak v. Bank Brussels Lambert, 252 F.3d 127, 130 (2d Cir. 
2001). When documents are attached as exhibits to the complaint, the Court may review such documents if they are deemed 
integral to plaintiffs' claims. See  Schnall v. Marine Midland Bank, 225 F.3d 263, 266 (2d Cir. 2000); see also  Connecticut 
Indem. Co. v. 21st Century Transport Co., Inc., 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10795, No. 99 Civ. 7735, 2001 WL 868340, at *3 
(E.D.N.Y. July 27, 2001)."
579,2," For purposes of this motion, the Court accepts as true all facts alleged in the Complaint. "
580,3," In their Memorandum of Law, defendants state that they are only seeking to dismiss the third, fourth and fifth claims. See Def. 
Mem. at 1. They state in a footnote that, if the California Attorney General seeks damages on behalf of non-residents of 
California, they also move to dismiss the sixth and seventh claims (presumably on preemption grounds). See id. at 5 n.3. In their 
Reply Memorandum, defendants assert that, based on their understanding of California's position, they are also seeking to 
dismiss the sixth claim. See Reply Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Third, Fourth, Fifth and 
Sixth Claims for Relief in the Amended Complaint (""Def. Repl."") at 1 n.1. Because the States have now explained that California 
is only seeking to recover on behalf of its own residents, see 2/5/02 Ltr., I will assume that defendants no longer move to dismiss 
the sixth claim. "
582,4," The Donnelly Act permits the New York Attorney General to seek injunctive relief and civil penalties ""in the name and in behalf 
of the people,"" and to recover damages ""on behalf of any political subdivision or public authority of the state."" Def. Mem. at 3 "
583,," (quoting N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law §§ 243, 342-a, 342-b). As defendants point out, the Act does not authorize the Attorney General to 
recover damages on behalf of the people. "
584,5," Defendants mistakenly rely on Jonathan Logan, supra, and Maryland v. Mid-Atlantic Toyota Distributors, Inc., 541 F. Supp. 62 
(D. Md. 1981) to support their argument that the Maryland Attorney General can only sue on behalf of Maryland residents. See 
Def. Mem. at 14-15. Both cases were decided before section 11-209 was amended in 1993. At the time of Jonathan Logan, 
section 11-209(a) only expressly permitted the Attorney General to ""institute proceedings in equity"" and did not expressly permit 
a court to award restitution for antitrust violations. See 482 A.2d at 2. The Maryland Court of Appeals held that, under the statute 
as it was then written, the Attorney General was not authorized to recover monetary relief for consumers. See id. at 8. Mid-
Atlantic Toyota simply confirmed that the Maryland Attorney General was authorized to bring an antitrust action on behalf of 
natural persons who were residents of Maryland. 541 F. Supp. at 64. The court was not presented with the question of whether 
the Attorney General could sue on behalf of non-residents. "
585,6," In their submissions to the Court, defendants do not explicitly disavow any reliance on the theory of express preemption or field 
preemption. See Def. Mem. at 5. However, defendants do not point to any language in the federal law expressly preempting 
state laws that would permit the Attorney General to sue on behalf of nonresidents. If defendants are claiming field preemption, 
this argument fails because the Supreme Court has recognized that Congress has not preempted the field of anti-trust law. See  
ARC Am. Corp., 490 U.S. at 102."
585,7, Section 4C of the Clayton Act states: 
586,," Any attorney general of a State may bring a civil action in the name of such State, as parens patriae on behalf of natural 
persons residing in such state . . . for injury sustained by such natural person to their property by reason of any violation of 
[the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1-7]."
586,15," U.S.C. § 15c. The States do not contest defendants' assertion that this provision only authorizes a state Attorney General to 
bring actions on behalf of the state's citizens."
586,8," Indeed, the legislative history and case law cited in defendants' Memorandum of Law indicates that section 4C created a ""new 
federal antitrust remedy,"" Def. Mem. at 6 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 499, 94th Cong., pt. 1, at 3, 6), that ""expanded existing 
common law use of parens patriae actions and 'enlarged the potential for consumer recovery for antitrust violations',"" id. at 7 
(quoting Pennsylvania v. Mid-Atlantic Toyota Dist., Inc., 704 F.2d 125, 128 (4th Cir. 1983))(emphasis added)."
586,9," In Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707, 97 S. Ct. 2061 (1977), the Court held that, with limited 
exceptions, section 4 of the Clayton Act did not authorize a state to recover under federal law for antitrust injuries to indirect 
purchasers. See also  ARC Am. Corp., 490 U.S. at 96. "
603,1," The issues for which Napster believes that there are disputed issues of fact are: plaintiffs' ownership of the copyrighted works 
at issue, copying of the works, fair use, the application of Sony, the extent of Napster's controll over its system and its policing 
obligation, the extent of the Napster system's architecture, the sufficiency of plaintiffs' notices and Napster's removal of those 
works, application of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, copyright misuse, and willfulness."
603,2," This order does not stay the entirety of plaintiffs' summary judgment motion. The court will reach a determination on the other 
issues raised by plaintiffs, but intends that necessary discovery commence on the threshold issues of ownership and misuse. 
The court denies Napster's request for further discovery related to Napster's fair use defense, an issue that will be discussed in a 
subsequent order."
603,3," To the extent referenced in this order, the declarations of Hank Barry and Roger Noll are unsealed. "
604,4," This termination right is under the 1976 Copyright Act. 17 U.S.C. § 203. The 1909 Act -- which applies to pre-1978 works -- 
operates in a similar fashion, though the length of the term is different. 17 U.S.C. § 304. "
605,5," HN9[
] The nine types of works are: a contribution to a collective work, part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, a translation, a supplementary work, a compilation, an instructional text, a test, answer material for a test, or an atlas. 17 U.S.C. § 
101(2). The statute also lists works that qualify as supplementary works."
605,6," Napster also challenges whether the other two elements of ""specially commissioned"" works are met. Because the court grants 
Napster's request for further discovery, the court does not reach these issues at this time."
605,7," The actual history of this attempted revision is intriguing. The recording industry succeeded in amending the definition of work 
made for hire to include sound recordings by claiming the change would be only a technical amendment. When the amendment 
went into effect in 2000, there was a tremendous outcry -- the rest of the recording community did not see the amendment as a 
technical change. See, e.g., RAC Amicus Br. at Exh. 1. The change was repealed retroactively. P.L. No. 106-379 (enacted 
2000). Today the definition of works made for hire includes the following text regarding this attempted amendment: HN10[
] In determining whether any work is eligible to be considered a work made for hire under paragraph (2), neither 
the amendment contained in section 1011(d) of the Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 
1999, as enacted by section 1000(a)(9) of Public Law 106-113, nor the deletion of the words added by that amendment-- (A) shall be considered or otherwise given any legal significance, or (B) shall be interpreted to indicate congressional approval or disapproval of, or acquiescence in, any judicial determination, 
by the courts or the Copyright Office. Paragraph (2) shall be interpreted as if both section 2(a)(1) of the Work Made For Hire 
and Copyright Corrections Act of 2000 and section 1011(d) of the Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus 
Reform Act of 1999, as enacted by section 1000(a)(9) of Public Law 106-113, were never enacted, and without regard to 
any inaction or awareness by the Congress at any time of any judicial determinations."
605,17, U.S.C. § 101. 
606,8," The court emphasizes that whatever determination is reached with respect to the presumption of ownership raised by plaintiffs' 
copyright certificates (and the corresponding presumption that all facts in the certificates are to be taken as true) only relates to 
the parties in this litigation and not to third parties (such as members of RAC) whose rights might otherwise be prejudiced. "
607,9," While the present motion addresses only the 213 Complaint Works, this action involves the alleged infringement of thousands 
of plaintiffs' works. HN16[
] The maximum statutory damages are $ 150,000 per act of infringement. See 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(1). "
609,10," This approach labels certain activities as per se copyright misuse and uses a rule of reason approach for others. See 
Frischmann & Moylan, The Evolving Common Law Doctrine of Copyright Misuse, 15 Berkely Tech. L.J. 865, 898. For those 
activities that fall within the rule of reason test, the court first asks whether the restraint is within the scope of the copyright 
monopoly. Id. If it is, then the conduct is per se legal. Id. If not, the court then asks whether the activity as a whole promotes or 
restricts competition. Id. If the particular activity (e.g. licensing provision) restricts competition, then it is copyright misuse. Id."
609,11," In comparison, there is a substantial body of case law on patent misuse. See, e.g.,  Morton Salt Co. v. G.S. Suppiger, 314 
U.S. 488, 86 L. Ed. 363, 62 S. Ct. 402 (1942). Patent misuse bases its analysis on antitrust principles and consequently is 
doctrinally analogous to antitrust-based copyright misuse. It is less helpful when employing the ""public policy"" analysis adopted 
by the Ninth Circuit. "
611,12," In Saturday Evening Post v. Rumbleseat Press, Inc., 816 F.2d 1191, 1200 (7th Cir. 1987), Judge Posner reiterated the 
Seventh's Circuit's belief that courts should rely on antitrust principles in misuse claims: 'If misuse claims are not to be tested by conventional antitrust principles, by what principles shall they be tested? Our law is 
not rich with alternative concepts of monopolistic abuse; and it is rather late in the date to try to develop one without in the 
process subjecting the rights of patent holders to debilitating uncertainty.' This point applies with even greater force to 
copyright misuse, where the danger of monopoly is less. Id. (quoting USM Corp. v. SPS Technologies, Inc., 694 F.2d 505, 512 (7th Cir. 1982))"
611,13," There are also allegations by Napster that the pricing structure of the MusicNet agreement prevents Napster from obtaining 
licenses from parties other than the five major record companies. See Barry Dec., Exh. 1. "
612,14," Plaintiffs find themselves in a catch-22 because if MusicNet does not obtain these licenses, the licensing provision may be 
unduly restrictive, and if MusicNet does obtain licenses from the non-MusicNet plaintiffs, such cross-licensing implicates 
potential antitrust concerns. See Noll Dec. P 110."
612,15," Although there may be a triumvirate with seemingly Zeus-like powers, the analogy is certainly imperfect. Perhaps some of the 
thunder god's brethren present a more appropriate object for comparison. "
613,16," Plaintiffs' argument would have merit if there was any evidence that Napster introduced and negotiated for the exclusivity 
provision. In that scenario, it would be unseemly to allow Napster to use the same provision as protection against infringement 
actions. Such a rule would create perverse incentives to artificially manufacture overreaching clauses as liability shields under 
the misuse doctrine. However, the evidence thus far shows that the relevant provisions were inserted at MusicNet's urging and 
not as an end-run around copyright laws by Napster. See Barry Dec. P 19. "
614,17," Because more discovery is necessary before reaching a final decision on Napster's misuse defense, the court does not rule on 
plaintiffs' objections at this time. "
616,18," Because the court focuses on harm to the public as a relevant factor in whether an unclean hands bar to misuse exists, it 
logically follows that the distinction between whether plaintiffs are seeking legal or equitable relief is less significant than 
suggested by Alcatel. It is possible that the public interest implicated by a misuse defense might justify allowing the defense 
even where defendants have unclean hands and plaintiffs are seeking solely legal relief."
616,19," The relative inequitableness of Napster's conduct is tied to this court's determination of Napster's willfulness. Logically, the 
mere act of infringement is not enough for unclean hands because such a rule would bar any infringer, innocent or intentional, 
from asserting misuse. HN33[
] Unclean hands must result from some particularly reprehensible conduct. See, e.g.,  Atari, 975 F.2d at 846 (""Atari lied to the Copyright Office in order to obtain the copyrighted [software] program.""). As a general matter, the 
same conduct often supports a finding of willfulness. "
636,1," Beyond the four briefs submitted in opposition to the plaintiffs' motions, the reply brief, and the three surreplies, the Court notes 
that parties have filed no less than eight additional submissions in support of their respective positions."
636,2, Choline Chloride is a B-complex vitamin and is also referred to as Vitamin B-4. See Choline Chloride Compl. P 1.
636,3," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides that HN1[
] ""every contract, combination . . . or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce . . . is . . . illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1."
636,4," The following is a partial of defendants who pled guilty and the criminal fines they agreed to pay, this list is only a sample of the 
prosecutions by the U.S. Dept. of Justice in its investigation of the vitamins industry: F. Hoffman-LaRoche ($ 500 million criminal 
fine); F. BASF AG ($ 225 million criminal fine); Merck KgaA ($ 14 million criminal fine); Takeda Chemicals Industries, Ltd. ($ 72 
million criminal fine); Eisai Co., Ltd ($ 40 million criminal fine); Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. ($ 25 million criminal fine); Lonza 
AG ($ 10.5 million criminal fine); Degussa-Huls AG ($ 13 million criminal fine); Nepera, Inc. ($ 4 million criminal fine); Reilly 
Industries Inc. ($ 2 million criminal fine). The following corporate defendants have pled guilty or agreed to plead guilty (the 
amount of the fine or penalty is not known): Rhone-Poulenc and Chinook Group. In addition, many corporate executives have 
pled guilty or agreed to plead guilty. The penalties for individuals included prison sentences and fines. Many of the defendants 
have settled with the class plaintiffs, see note 7. "
637,5," Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides: HN2[
] ""That any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of 
anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the United States . . . and shall recover threefold 
the damages . . . the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."" 15 U.S.C. § 15"
637,6," Since the filing of the class complaint, class plaintiffs have dismissed certain individuals who are past or present employees of 
the corporate defendants including: Lindell Hilling, John L. ""Pete"" Fischer, Russell Cosbourn, John Kennedy, and Robert 
Samuelson. Choline Chloride class plaintiffs have reached settlement agreements, on behalf of a Choline Chloride Class, 
approved by this Court, with BASF AG (as part of a large bulk vitamins settlement), AKZO Nobel, N.V., and UCB Chemicals, and 
their subsidiaries and affiliates."
637,7," Class plaintiffs reached a settlement, approved by this Court, on behalf of a Vitamin Products Class, with seven international 
companies and their affiliates (nineteen firms in all) including: Hoffman-La Roche, Inc., Roche Vitamins, Inc., F Hoffman-La 
Roche Ltd, Rhone-Poulenc Inc., Rhone-Poulenc Animal Nutrition Inc., Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Rhone-
Poulenc S.A., BASF Corporation, BASF AG, Hoechst Marion Roussel, S.A., Eisai Co., Ltd., Eisai U.S.A., Inc., Eisai Inc., Daiichi 
Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., Daiichi Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Daiichi Fine Chemicals, Inc., Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., 
Takeda U.S.A., Inc. and Takeda Vitamin & Food USA, Inc. Sales by these entities are believed to represent more than 90% of 
the total market for the affected vitamin products."
637,8," HN3[
] Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4) provides that ""when appropriate . . . a class may be divided into subclasses and each subclass treated as a class, and the provisions of this rule shall then be construed and applied accordingly."" "
639,9," Defendants urge the Court to, ""probe behind the pleadings,"" Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160, 72 L. Ed. 2d 740, 102 S. Ct. 2364, and 
""conduct a rigorous analysis to examine and understand the relevant industry in making a Rule 23 determination,"" Domestic 
Air, 137 F.R.D. at 685 n.10. The Defendants seem to argue that the Court should resolve factual discrepancies before 
determining whether proceeding as a class is appropriate. Although Defendants are correct in asserting that ""class determination 
generally involves considerations that are 'enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff's cause of action,'"" 
Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 469, 57 L. Ed. 2d 351, 98 S. Ct. 2454(1978) (quoting Mercantile Nat. Bank v. 
Langdeau, 371 U.S. 555, 558, 9 L. Ed. 2d 523, 83 S. Ct. 520 (1963)), the Court finds that an investigation into the merits of the 
case at this time would run afoul of Eisen. See417 U.S. 156, 177-78. The Court notes the recent cases cited by defendants (e.g. 
Newton v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner, & Smith, Inc., 259 F.3d 154 (3rd Cir. 2001), Szabo v. Bridgeport Machs. Inc., 249 F.3d 
672 (7th Cir. 2001)) which question the continuing vitality of Eisen by suggesting that courts should make whatever legal and 
factual inquiries are necessary under Rule 23. This circuit, however, has not taken that step. See  Curtin v. United Airlines, Inc., 
275 F.3d 88, 92 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 28, 2001) (citing the holding and the relevant dicta in Eisen as prohibiting a preliminary inquiry 
into the merits at the class certification stage). "
640,10," As a preliminary matter, the Court will briefly address the Niacin defendants standing argument. See In re NASDAQ Market - 
Makers Antitrust Litig., 169 F.R.D. 493, 504-05 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) HN13[
] (""Standing to sue is an essential threshold which must be crossed before any determination as to class representation under Rule 23 can be made.""). Defendants argue that the 
named plaintiffs lack standing to sue because they lack a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy. See Niacin Mem. at 
18-19. Essentially, the Niacin defendants conflate this argument with their argument that the named representatives are not 
adequate because they did not purchase all of the vitamins products involved. While this will be more thoroughly addressed 
below with respect to the adequacy prerequisite, the Court is not persuaded that this fact establishes that the named plaintiffs 
lack standing. Defendants have offered virtually no support for this argument. On the record before the Court, the plaintiffs' 
proposed classes of direct purchasers have standing to sue."
640,11," HN15[
] Rule 23(c)(1) provides, in pertinent part, ""An order under this subdivision may . . . be altered or amended before the decision on the merits."" HN16[
] Rule 23(c)(4) states: ""When appropriate … a class may be subdivided into subclasses…."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. While the defendants have argued that subclasses rather than certifying the proposed classes, the Court is 
convinced that certifying the classes as proposed is proper at this time. "
643,12," The Vitamins Complaint (Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint, filed June 1, 2000) lists 16 additional 
plaintiffs. However, plaintiffs moved to dismiss the following plaintiffs: AG Mark, Inc., Dad's Products Co., Inc., Freeman 
Industries L.L.C., Hi-Tek Rations, J. Crookshank, T. Crookshank, A. Kardoes, O. Kardoes, Lakeland Cash Feed Co., Livengood 
Feeds, Inc., McDuffy Feed & Supply, Inc., Nature's Value, Inc., Nutritional Specialists, Wright Enrichment, Inc., Seltzer 
Chemicals, Inc., 1700 Pharmacy Corporation, JBDL Corporation, and, Horizon Laboratories, Inc. This motion was granted in an 
Order dated December 19, 2000. "
645,13," In fact, Degussa, Lonza, Reilly, and Nepra, the so-called Niacin defendants, concede that class action in this case would be 
appropriate on a more narrowly defined scale and concede and are willing to stipulate to a properly defined ""Niacin Purchasers 
Class"" for claims relating to the purchase of niacin and niacinamide. See Niacin Surreply at 2. "
646,14," Defendants cite additional cases in their opposition brief. See Merck Mem. at 12, n. 11,12.) "
647,15," As this Court noted earlier in this litigation, ""the inference to be drawn from the plaintiffs' allegations is that the lack of 
competition among defendants for particular products or particular geographic areas was the direct result of their agreement to 
eliminate such competition."" Memorandum Opinion Re: Motions to Dismiss at 21 (May 9, 2000) [hereinafter, May 9, 2000 Op.] 
(citing In re Brand Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litig., 123 F.3d 599 (7th Cir. 1997))."
647,16," This Court has repeatedly rejected defendants' attempts to imply that the guilty pleas and class settlements to date suggest 
the existence of separate conspiracies rather than a single conspiracy as alleged. See May 9, 2000 Op. at n. 13 (""It is perfectly 
acceptable for the government and plaintiffs to take different views of the scope of this conspiracy, even if plaintiffs refer to the 
government's documents to support their claims of the defendants' involvement in the alleged activities. Moreover, the Court has 
no evidence of the government's view of the scope of this conspiracy; the fact that the government chose to divide the 
conspiracy into separate parts does not in any way support the defendant's position that there could not have been a single 
overarching conspiracy.""). "
649,17," Dr. Beyer found (1) that defandants ""enjoyed a high degree of market power;"" (2) that within vitamins products, each of the 
bulk vitamins subject to the alleged conspiracy is an undifferentiated, commodity-like product; (3) there is a ""high-degree of 
product and geographic overlap among defendants;"" and (4) there are ""significant barriers to entry."" Beyer Bulk Vitamins Decl. at 
P P 9, 13. "
650,18," Since the initial complaint in this consolidated action (Donaldson & Hasenbein, d/b/a J&R Feed Services, Inc. v. F. Hoffman 
LaRoche, Ltd., Cas Number 1:98-CV-00762 (D.D.C.)) was filed on March 25, 1998, the period March 25, 1994 through March 
25, 1998 falls within the four year limitations period set forth by 15 U.S.C. § 15(b)."
650,19," As this Court noted previously in the present litigation, HN41[
] ""In order to prevail on a claim for fraudulent concealment 
under federal antitrust law, a plaintiff must plead with sufficient particularity (1) that the defendants engaged in a course of 
conduct designed to conceal evidence of their alleged wrongdoing and that (2) the plaintiffs were not on actual or constructive 
notice of that evidence, despite (3) their exercise of due diligence."" May 9, 2000 Op. at 3 (citing,  Larson v. Northrop Corp., 305 
U.S. App. D.C. 416, 21 F.3d 1164, 1172 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). "
652,20," The Court notes that at the time of the first settlement in this case there were three pending complaints - one for a Vitamins 
Product Class, one for a Choline Chloride Class, and one for a Niacin Class. The Niacin defendants became part of the non-
settling defendants and thus subject to this instant motion for certification of a Bulk Vitamins Class only after plaintiffs were 
granted leave to file a Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint. "
653,21, See Wakabayashi Decl. P 5.
653,22," See Wakabayashi Decl. P 7, Defendants also note that Tanabe U.S.A. is only alleged to have sold biotin and that Tanabe 
Seiyaku did not sell any vitamins in the United States from January 1, 1990 to the present. See Ujino Decl. P 3."
653,23," The Merck Opposition Memo on p. 2-3 refers to the Class Notice and Claim Form and opt-out instructions sent to direct 
purchasers with respect to the previous class settlement. See Walker Aff. Ex. 1."
653,24," The definition for the proposed vitamins product class in this case sets the time period from January 1, 1990 to September 30, 
1998. See Plaintiffs' Consolidated Reply p. 3, n.2."
653,25," Defendants do not mention Tanabe U.S.A. when making this argument, presumably because it is obvious that they have 
made direct sales to class members during the time period set forth in the proposed class certification. "
661,1," In support of this argument, appellee relies on Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707, 97 S. Ct. 2061 
(1977), which will be discussed in detail infra. HN1[
] The basic rule stemming from Illinois Brick is that only direct purchasers may bring suit under federal antitrust law to recover for alleged overcharges. "
662,2," Hanover Shoe involved an antitrust action brought against a manufacturer of shoes. The manufacturer defended the action by 
claiming that the plaintiff did not sustain antitrust injury because it had passed the alleged overcharges on to retail customers as 
indirect purchasers. The Court rejected this defense and held that direct purchasers are injured in the full amount of the 
overcharge paid by them to the alleged antitrust violator.  Hanover Shoe, 392 U.S. at 494. "
663,3," The relevant portion of section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15 provides, HN12[
] ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefore…"" 15 U.S.C. § 15(a)(2001). "
664,4," We recognize that HN15[
] the mere introduction of a bill to the General Assembly, particularly a bill defeated in committee, 
does not establish legislative intent. We are not relying on the introduction of Senate Bill 484 to support the application of Illinois 
Brick to MATA actions, nor do we need to so rely, as the preceding discussion offers ample authority."
664,5," Because the plaintiffs' claims in In re Microsoft are nearly identical to those in the case sub judice, and because we agree with 
Judge Motz's thorough analysis of the Illinois Brick issues, we adopt relevant portions of Judge Motz's opinion. "
667,1," The Court held: We affirm in part and reverse in part the District Court's judgment that Microsoft violated § 2 of the Sherman Act by employing 
anticompetitive means to maintain a monopoly in the operating system market; we reverse the District Court's determination that 
Microsoft violated § 2 of the Sherman Act by illegally attempting to monopolize the internet browser market; and we remand the 
District Court's finding that Microsoft violated § 1 of the Sherman Act by unlawfully tying its browser to its operating system. Our 
judgment extends to the District Court's findings with respect to the state law counterparts of the plaintiffs' Sherman Act claims. We also find merit in Microsoft's challenge to the Final Judgment embracing the District Court's remedial order. There are 
several reasons supporting this conclusion. First, the District Court's Final Judgment rests on a number of liability determinations 
that do not survive appellate review; therefore, the remedial order as currently fashioned cannot stand. Furthermore, we would 
vacate and remand the remedial order even were we to uphold the District Court's liability determinations in their entirety, 
because the District Court failed to hold an evidentiary hearing to address remedies-specific factual disputes. Finally, we vacate the Final Judgment on remedies, because the trial judge engaged in impermissible ex parte contacts by 
holding secret interviews with members of the media and made numerous offensive comments about Microsoft officials in public 
statements outside of the courtroom, giving rise to an appearance of partiality. Although we find no evidence of actual bias, we 
hold that the actions of the trial judge seriously tainted the proceedings before the District Court and called into question the 
integrity of the judicial process. We are therefore constrained to vacate the Final Judgment on remedies, remand the case for 
reconsideration of the remedial order, and require that the case be assigned to a different trial judge on remand. We believe that 
this disposition will be adequate to cure the cited improprieties. "
668,2," Hanover Shoe involved an antitrust action brought against a manufacturer of shoes. The manufacturer defended the action by 
claiming that the plaintiff had not been injured in its business because it had passed on the alleged overcharges to retail "
669,," customers as indirect purchasers. The Court rejected the defense.  Hanover Shoe, 392 U.S. at 494. The Court was heavily 
persuaded by the concern that unless direct purchasers were allowed to sue, antitrust violators ""would retain the fruits of their 
illegality."" Id. "
682,1," Defendants' motion challenges the constitutionality of the Colorado limited winery statute's licensing provisions. The Colorado 
Department of Agriculture filed an Amicus Curiae brief in support of the constitutionality of the state statute. "
683,2," Certain Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and Brief in Support of the Motion [filed September 5, 2001] and Defendants Tom 
Mullen and Gore Valley Enterprise, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss [filed September 5, 2001], are directed to the allegations of the First

685,3," In pan delicto means ""in equal fault."" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY at 711 (5th ed. 1979). "
686,4," HN11[
] At least four Circuit Courts of Appeal have held that in pan delicto is a viable defense when the plaintiff's participation 
in the anti-competitive scheme is equal to, or greater than, that of the defendants. See Sullivan v. NFL, 34 F.3d 1091, 1107-1108 
(1st cir. 1994); Columbia Nitrogen Corp. v. Royster Co., 451 F.2d 3, 15-16 (4th Cir. 1971); Gen. Leaseways, Inc. v. Nat'l Truck 
Leasing Ass'n, 830 F.2d 716, 724 (7th Cir. 1987); THI-Hawaii, Inc. v. First Commerce Fin. Corp., 627 F.2d 991 (9th Cir. 1980)."
686,5," In the Ninth Circuit, the question of whether plaintiff's illegal market presence will preclude standing to assert an antitrust action 
turns on whether the plaintiffs illegal conduct is characterized as a public or private wrong. In Memorex Corp. v. IBM, 555 F.2d 
1379 (9th Cir. 1977), IBM contended that plaintiff had not suffered an injury redressable under Section 4 of the Clayton Act 
because the plaintiff's presence in the disc storage device market was a result of the plaintiff's theft of trade secrets from IBM. 
555 F.2d at 1380-1381. The defendant argued that plaintiff's unlawful market presence established the absence of injury to 
plaintiff. Id. at 1381. HN14[
] The Ninth Circuit held that, regardless of the way the defendant characterized its position, 
illegality is not a defense to an antitrust action when the illegal acts of the plaintiff are directed against the defendant. Id. at 1382. 
The court reasoned that a plaintiff's private wrongdoing should not bar its antitrust action against a defendant who has 
committed a public wrong by violating the antitrust laws.Id. The Ninth Circuit left open the question of whether a plaintiff who 
participates in anti-competitive conduct would be barred from suing under the antitrust laws. 555 F.2d at 1382. That question 
was answered in the affirmative in THI-Hawaii, Inc. In Pearl Music Co., Inc. v. Recording Indus. Ass'n of Am., Inc., 460 F. Supp. 1060 (D.C. Cal. 1978), the district court held that 
plaintiffs lacked standing to sue defendant under the antitrust laws because plaintiffs were selling pirated prerecorded tapes, 
conduct which was a crime under federal law and the laws of forty-nine states. Id. at 1068. The District Court distinguished 
Memorex Corp. on the ground that the plaintiffs' entirely illegal business constituted a public wrong, while the plaintiff in 
Memorex Corp. had engaged in a private wrong against the defendant. Id. "
687,6," Defendants do not allege that plaintiff participated in the Sherman Act violations alleged in the Second Amended Complaint. If 
defendants had made such an assertion, it would not be an appropriate ground for dismissal on a Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) motion 
because the issue could not be resolved without reference to matters outside the pleadings. "
688,7," Because the constitutionality of the Colorado limited winery statutory licensing provisions have no bearing on plaintiff's standing 
to assert a Sherman Act claim, the court does not reach plaintiffs' arguments that defendants cannot satisfy the ""case or 
controversy"" requirement of Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution in order to challenge the statute's constitutionality."
688,8," Boulder Liquor Mart, Morgan's and Applejack are liquor retailers. (Second Amended Compl., PP8, 12, 26) Defendants Jack 
Stoakes, the president and CEO of Liquor Mart, James Shpall, the vice president of Applejack, and Larry Peterson are agents 
with authority to act on behalf of defendants Boulder Liquor Mart, Morgan's and Applejack, respectively. (Id. at PP33, 53, 54 93). "

notice of what the plaintiffs claim is and the grounds upon which it rests."

692,16," HN27[
] If an antitrust plaintiff relies on circumstantial evidence, conduct which is equally consistent with permissible 
competition as with illegal conspiracy is not sufficient by itself to support an inference of antitrust conspiracy. Monsanto Co. v. 
Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775, 104 S. Ct. 1464 (1984). Accordingly, at the summary judgment stage, or 
on a motion for directed verdict, a plaintiff seeking damages for a Section 1 violation must present evidence ""'that tends to 
exclude the possibility' that the alleged conspirators acted independently."" Matsushita Elec. Indust. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio 
Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 588, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986)(quoting Monsanto). When the evidence is ambiguous, the 
inference of conspiracy must be reasonable in light of the competing inference of independent action. Id."
692,17," Other ""plus factors"" which may help an antitrust plaintiff clear the hurdle of summary judgment include evidence that the 
defendants attended meetings or conducted discussions at which they had the opportunity to conspire, or, that one alleged "
693,," conspirator expressly invited common action by the others. Petruzzi's IGA Supermarkets, Inc., 998 F.2d at 1242 (citing William 
C. Holmes, 1992 Antitrust Law Handbook § 1.03[3], at 154)."
693,18," Although plaintiff does not allege with certainty that defendants Shpall, Peterson and Stoakes attended the CLRI board 
meeting, plaintiff does allege that those defendants were CLRI board members and that a board meeting was held on February 
2, 2000, which was attended by some or all of those defendants. On a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court reasonably infers from 
plaintiffs allegations that defendants Shpall, Stoakes and Peterson did attend the February 2, 2000 meeting. "
694,19," Shpall also argues that he cannot be held personally liable for the alleged actions of Applejack. This argument is without merit. 
HN29[
] A corporate officer or agent may be held liable for the wrongful acts of the corporation if the officer actively participated 
in acts which harmed the complaining party. Lowell Staats Mining Co. v. Phila. Elec. Co., 651 F. Supp. 1364, 1368 (D.Colo. 
1987), aff'd 878 F.2d 1271 (10th Cir. 1989). Plaintiff alleges that Shpall is the vice president of Applejack and that Shpall acted 
on behalf of himself and as the agent of Applejack in agreeing with other Colorado liquor retailers to engage in a boycott of 
Confre wines and the wines of other Colorado wineries that sold wine to the Vail tasting room. Plaintiff also alleges that 
Applejack stopped carrying plaintiffs wines while the Vail tasting room was open. These allegations are sufficient to infer Shpall's 
active participation in the alleged unlawful conspiracy at the pleading stage. "

706,3," HN1[
] On October 24, 1999, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) adopted the Uniform 
Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy, which effectively altered all contracts between domain name registrars and their 
customers, mandating the use of WIPO arbitration to resolve domain name disputes before resorting to litigation in U.S. courts. 
Plaintiffs do not dispute this, nor do they dispute that the agreement with Verisign for the cosmos.com domain name now 
mandates the WIPO proceeding. "
707,4," The complaint was assigned to a sole arbitrator, an attorney from the United Kingdom, the location of defendant's principal 
place of business."
707,5," Worth noting here is that the result reached in the WIPO proceeding is neither admissible, nor entitled to any deference, with 
respect to the merits issues presented in this suit. Review here must be de novo and independent of any WIPO panel

708,6," Virginia choice of law rules apply here because HN3[

] 
in diversity cases, federal courts apply the choice of law rules of the forum state). HN5[
] In tort cases, Virginia applies the rule 
of lex loci delicti, the place of the injury supplies the governing law in tort actions. See  Jones v. R.S. Jones and Assoc., Inc., 246 
Va. 3, 431 S.E.2d 33, 34 (Va. 1993); see also  Diaz Vicente v. Obenauer, 736 F. Supp. 679, 690 (E.D. Va. 1999). Here, the parties assumed without analysis that Virginia substantive law applied. While it is undisputed that the domain name 
was registered with NSI/Verisign in Herndon, Virginia and that the registrar certificate has been deposited with the Clerk of this 
Court, neither party addressed the location of the place of injury, i.e., where the injury occurred. For example, the record does 
not disclose the location of the server containing the content of the cosmos.com website. Given the absence of evidence of the 
place of the injury and the absence of any dispute between the parties on governing law, the analysis here proceeds on the 
premise that Virginia substantive law governs the tortious interference and abuse of process claims. In any event, to the extent 
that this choice of law analysis is problematical, it does not alter the result reached here because there are additional, 
independent reasons for dismissal of the claims."

an important, indeed favored, component of the adjudicatory process."
710,16," Also worth noting at this point is that plaintiffs' position with respect to the abuse of process claim and the Noerr-Pennington 
doctrine is contradictory. On the one hand, plaintiffs assert that defendant's maintenance of the WIPO proceeding constitutes 
abuse of process, yet, to counter defendant's Noerr-Pennington argument, plaintiffs argue that the doctrine does not apply 
because WIPO is a private body and its procedures do not constitute ""process."" Plaintiffs cannot have it both ways: either a 
WIPO proceeding is ""process,"" as held here, in which event Noerr-Pennington applies to bar plaintiff's tort claims based on 
defendant's maintenance of the WIPO claim, or the WIPO proceeding is not ""process,"" as plaintiffs claim to avoid Noerr-
Pennington, in which event there can be no abuse of process claim. "

722,4," In their complaint, the Baileys listed Blount County, Etowah County and Marshall County as the intended service area of 
Bailey's Propane Gas. Later interrogatory responses indicated the service area also might include portions of Cullman County

723,5," Robert Love, Jr., vice-president of Allgas, testified that Allgas believed its Altoona office was going to be ""the center fix of what

724,11," On remand, the case was reassigned from the Honorable Robert B. Propst to the Honorable Sharon Lovelace Blackburn. "
725,12," The other type of violation under the Robinson-Patman Act, not at issue here, is called ""secondary-line"" price discrimination, 
which involves price discrimination by a seller which affects competition among its buyers. See  Chrysler Credit Corp. v. J. Truett 
Payne Co., 670 F.2d 575, 580 (Former 5th Cir. 1982). "
726,13," HN9[
] A primary-line injury claim also has a jurisdictional requirement; the discriminatory sales must take place ""in commerce."" See 15 U.S.C. § 13(a). This requirement has been interpreted to mean at least one sale, whether it be the below-
cost sale or the sale to which the below-cost sale is being compared, must have crossed a state line. See  Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp 
Paving Co., 419 U.S. 186, 200-01, 95 S. Ct. 392, 401, 42 L. Ed. 2d 378 (1974). Whether the Baileys have met the jurisdictional requirement of the Robinson-Patman Act was not raised on appeal. It is likely, 
however, the jurisdictional requirement is met. Although the complaint merely alleged Allgas served a large area in the State of 
Alabama, the president of Allgas testified that the company's service area also included portions of Tennessee. "
727,14," HN13[
] Whereas § 2 of the Sherman Act condemns predatory pricing posing a dangerous probability of actual monopolization, the Robinson-Patman Act merely forbids predatory pricing posing a reasonable possibility of harm to 
""competition."" Compare  15 U.S.C. § 2 with 15 U.S.C. § 13(a). Based on the difference in language between the Sherman Act 
and the Robinson-Patman Act, the United States Supreme Court has held competitive injury under the Robinson-Patman Act 
""must extend beyond the monopoly setting."" Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 229, 113 S. Ct. at 2591. As a result, the Robinson-
Patman Act can be violated when primary-line injury occurs in an oligopoly setting.  Id., 113 S. Ct. at 2591. "
728,15," At the Rule 104 hearing regarding the admissibility of Gunther's testimony, the Baileys contradicted the testimony of Gunther 
and represented to the district court that the relevant product market consisted of liquid propane gasoline sold to both residential 
and industrial customers."
728,16," Allgas' expert, Dr. Robert McLeod, testified there are four main alternatives to propane gas heat: (1) natural gas; (2) electric 
heat; (3) wood heat; and, (4) coal heat. "
729,17," The area of a circle with a 10-mile radius is approximately 314 square miles; the area of a circle with a 20-mile radius is 
approximately 1256 square miles. "
730,18," Because Allgas' main competitor, Dowdle Gas, purportedly served a larger percentage of agricultural customers, Max Bailey 
estimated Allgas' share of the residential market was significantly higher than its share of the overall market."
730,19," Gunther's preliminary report itself demonstrates a flaw in his conclusion Allgas controls almost 50% of the allegedly relevant 
market. Using data from the 1990 Census, Gunther estimated there were approximately 16,657 residential homes in the ""Susan 
Moore market"" which used liquid propane gas. See Preliminary Report, at 8. Assuming each residential customer consumed 
between 600 and 1,500 gallons of propane gas during the year, Gunther estimated potential residential demand in the relevant 
market of between 9,994,221 and 24,985,553 gallons per year. Id. Allgas records, however, indicate domestic sales by its 
Altoona district office of no more than 1,370,000 gallons per year. Thus, even if all of the propane gas sold by the Altoona office 
was sold within the ""Susan Moore market,"" Allgas would possess a market share in the relevant market of between 5.48% to 
13.7%. "
731,20," Even after acknowledging the calculation of ROA should be based on after-tax profit, Gunther used Allgas' estimated change 
in retained earnings as a proxy. Gunther then compared Allgas' ROA with the average ROA for Fortune 500 companies, which 
Gunther assumed was based on after-tax profit rather than retained earnings. The propriety of using change in retained earnings 
will not be addressed herein. "
732,21,"  Differences between accounting and economic costs. Accounting profits differ from economic profits in several important 
ways. First, accountants try to determine costs (and profits) for the firm (or perhaps a division of it) over some regularized 
period, such as a year or a quarter. By contrast, the economist wants to know the profitability of a project over its entire 
lifetime, including all planning and investment costs, and ""spillovers."" Any given project might show accounting losses in 
one year and profits in the next, but the final accounting is the only important one for the economist. Unlike the accountant, 
moreover, the economist measuring monopoly profit is less interested in the total of a firm's profits made from all its various 
projects over the firm's life. Rather, the antitrust analyst wants to know whether the firm now has market power over some 
particular product (or group of products). Second, accountants identify costs by looking at historical expenditures, while economists count so-called opportunity 
costs. The opportunity cost of capital, sometimes called the normal rate of return, or profit, is the smallest payment that 
must be made to the owners of a firm's capital to induce them to invest in the firm, rather than in their next best investment 
alternative. This rate of return precisely compensates investors for the profit they could achieve elsewhere that they have 
foregone by investing in the firm. Economists regard capital's opportunity cost as a cost and define economic profit as the 
return to investors above and beyond what is necessary to induce them to invest. By excluding such costs, accounting 
profits exceed economic profits. Thus, the perfectly competitive firm in equilibrium earns zero economic profits though its 
normal returns are reflected in positive accounting profits. Hence, substantial accounting profits -- say, 20 percent -- may be 
consistent with trivial or zero economic profit and thus do not necessarily indicate any market power. Accounting costs fail to reflect opportunity costs in other respects as well. For example, accountants depreciate durable 
resources on the basis of their historical cost. By contrast, the economic value of a resource is determined by its value to 
the owner in the best alternative use. With any inflation, historical costs understate economic costs -- increasing so as the 
asset is more durable -- such that accounting profit exceeds economic profit. Consider the accounting treatment of a 
warehouse that the firm either rents for $ 1,000 monthly or owns. The accountant counts the rental as a cost. But if the 
warehouse is owned, it may count for much less. If the warehouse is fully depreciated and there is no mortgage interest, 
the accountant may count the ""cost"" of owning the warehouse as zero, not counting maintenance and taxes. But this 
warehouse still ""costs"" the firm the $ 1,000 it foregoes by using the warehouse itself rather than renting it to others at the $ 
1,000 market price. Whether owned or rented, the warehouse is a necessary productive input whose value in its best 
alternative use (in this case, renting it to someone else) must be considered before finding economic profits. IIA, Areeda, supra P 516f1. "
733,22," In his deposition, Gunther appeared to recognize a better comparator to Allgas' ROA would have been the ROA for the liquid 
propane gas industry: A. Well, you have to have some reference point. If I'm selling ball point pens and I'm making a 50 percent return on my 
investment, but the average ball point pen maker in the whole U.S. is making five percent return on investment, then, 
without knowing what the other players are in my market, then I'm obviously doing better than my opportunity costs of being 
somewhere else, then one can conclude that you're making an economic profit. Q. So at least you need to know what the industry average is? A. You need a reference point, yeah, to -- to know. Because the idea of super normal is above that which is an average or 
normal, super normal. What's normal? Normal is when -- if you could go to the bank and put your money in six percent and 
that's your opportunity cost, then you're not making a profit until you at least cover that. Q. But if you are manufacturing pens, you are not going to compare that rate of return to, say, someone who is 
manufacturing silicon chips, right? A. No. You would have to make the next best available opportunity so it would not be a brain surgeon or a garbage 
collector. Gunther Depo. at 76-77. Later, when asked about his use of the ROA for Fortune 500 companies, Gunther stated: 
""Unfortunately, there is no data that I could find anywhere that talked about the average profitability of a propane retail marketer. 
That was one of the questions that I asked of this lady at the National Propane Gas Association and she said that I really needed 
to talk to Bill Butterball in Washington, D.C., who's the director of regulatory affairs and he was not available."" See Gunther 
Depo. at 104-05. Gunther did not make any other efforts to find data for companies similar to Allgas. In a supplemental affidavit, Gunther purported to compare Allgas' ROA with the ROA of companies within the 5900 category of 
Moody's Industrial Review (propane gas companies are classified under 5984). See April 11, 1997 Affidavit of William Gunther. 
An examination of the comparators reveals they consisted of retail drug stores, including Arbor Drugs, Inc., Walgreen Co., and 
Eckert Corp. Id. These companies are in no way similar to Allgas or its industry. Comparison with these companies, therefore, is 
meaningless."
733,23," In his deposition, Gunther himself admitted his methodology would need to be applied over the course of several years: Certainly, if a company is earning economic profits in one year, and you say, well, you know, should the Justice Department 
begin to take action? You would say that doesn't make a lot of sense because the way the market is suppose to work is that 
the presence of the super normal profits becomes a market signal for entry. And so what you want to do is allow opportunity 
for entry to occur. And competition will take care of the problem. So you don't want to have a lot of heavy regulations. But if 
you were observing that a company, let's take the ready to eat cereal anti-trust case, where for 8 or 10 or 15 years one 
could show that they were earning super normal profits, well, then it's clear that entry wasn't taking care of the problem and 
that's why the Justice Department brought the suit. So, no, I would not say that super normal profits in one year is a clear 
indication. While it isn't of something wrong, it's an indication that the economic profits to be made or one ought to look at 
the opportunity for economic profits to be made because there are these super normal profits. "
734,," See Gunther Depo. at 102-03. As discussed infra, Gunther only included the data for two years in his preliminary report despite 
measuring Allgas' ROA over the course of four years."
734,24," Interestingly, Gunther's assessment of ROA led to the following conclusion: ""Economic theory suggests that these economic 
profits would attract competition and new firms would be expected to enter the market."" Preliminary Report at 9. As discussed 
infra, the existence of elevated profits for some period of time may be indicative of a perfectly competitive market where the 
supranormal returns serve as a signal to new entrants. The fact that returns are inflated for a short time, therefore, does not itself 
indicate the market operates as an oligopoly."
734,25," When asked in his deposition about the omission of Allgas' ROAs for 1992 and 1995, Gunther indicated: ""But what I'm trying 
to establish here is whether there is sufficient reason for the entry of new firms. Was there the presence of economic profits 
being earned at the time Mr. Bailey was considering entering the market?"" See Gunther Depo. at 96-97. The purpose of 
Gunther's testimony, however, was to demonstrate Allgas operated within an oligopoly, not whether it was rational for the 
Baileys to enter the market."
734,26," Gunther himself acknowledged the need to focus on the Altoona district: Q. . . . . But for our purposes in terms of determining whether there are excess economic profits for the Altoona office, the 
best test would have been to evaluate the asset base there, what their retained earnings were for the office, right? A. That's correct. Gunther Depo. at 87-88. "
736,27," Allgas drivers earned compensation via a combination of base salary and commission, with commissions comprising 
approximately 45% of the total compensation. Allgas was concerned erosion of its customer base would convince drivers to 
switch employment to Bailey's Propane Gas, thereby further reducing its clientele. "
745,1," The Insurance Company Defendants' motion papers attached a copy of the complaint in the New York State Court case, and I 
am entitled to take judicial notice of it. Fed. R. Evid. 201; see, e.g.,  Hill v. Goord, 63 F. Supp. 2d 254, 256 (E.D.N.Y. 1999) (""It . . 
. is entirely proper for this Court to take judicial notice of the actions taken in . . . related [state court] proceedings 'to establish 
the fact of such litigation and related filings.'"") (quoting Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. v. Rotches Pork Packers, Inc., 969 F.2d 1384, 
1388 (2d Cir. 1992). "
746,2," By letter to the Court, Intellective expressed a desire to amend the complaint to assert facts sufficient to support a claim for 
sham litigation. Intellective contends that it was not able to assert such facts earlier because the state court proceeding was still 
in its infancy when Intellective filed its federal complaint. At that time, the state court plaintiffs (defendants here) had succeeded 
in obtaining an ex parte Temporary Restraining Order against Intellective, but the state court had not yet rendered a decision on 
their application for Preliminary Injunction. However, it is clear that the state court proceeding is not a sham. Although the state 
court eventually decided against granting an injunction on the software portion of the complaint, the fact that a state court 
granted a TRO and then a partial preliminary injunction precludes a finding that the litigation was ""objectively baseless."" See, 
e.g.,  Omni Resource Development Corp. v. Conoco, Inc., 739 F.2d 1412 (9th Cir. 1984) (grant of preliminary injunction 
precluded finding of sham). "
749,3," Defendant's mistake is easy to understand, as the Amended Complaint is not a model in clarity. Intellective causes confusion 
by hinting at antitrust injuries of which it cannot complaint. For example, is Intellective complaining about loss of competition 
among insurance companies? See Compl. P 31. Intellective lacks standing to premise any claim on this alleged antitrust injury, 
as Intellective is not an insurance company. Is Intellective complaining about loss of competition among investment analysts? If 
so, its complaint would not be plausible, for there are innumerable outlets for investment analysis. "
750,4," Defendants contend that 15% or even 20% is too small a share as a matter of law to enable the Insurance Company 
Defendants to raise the overall market price or restrict the overall output. Cases cited by defendants include such language as, 
""fifty percent is below any accepted benchmark for inferring monopoly power from market share."" Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 65 
F.3d at 1411. The cases cited by defendants concern whether a monopoly can be inferred from market share alone. Intellective 
is not arguing that the existence of a monopoly should be inferred from the Working Group's percentage control of the life 
insurance industry. Rather, Intellective argues that by acting together, the Working Group members possess a significant market 
share such that they can influence and control other companies who are acting alone. "
758,1, Microsoft requested oral argument. We deny the request. 
759,2," The corresponding provision of the Federal Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15, provides in pertinent part: HN6[
] any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may 
sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, 
without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, 
including a reasonable attorney's fee. "
760,3," Berghausen also asserts his action is not precluded by the Illinois Brick rule because two exceptions to Illinois Brick apply. We 
disagree. Berghausen first asserts ""the Supreme Court said in Illinois Brick that indirect purchasers would be allowed to sue under federal 
law in situations where the amount of the unlawful overcharge was determined 'without reference to the interaction of supply and 
demand.'"" (Appellant's Br. at 18, quoting  Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 736.) Illinois Brick articulated no such broad exception, and 
we admonish Berghausen's counsel to more accurately characterize the precedent on which he relies. Instead, it noted that the 
prior case law had cited, as the only example of a situation where the defense might be permitted, a pre-existing cost-plus contract. In such a situation, 
the purchaser is insulated from any decrease in its sales as a result of attempting to pass on the overcharge, because its 
customer is committed to buying a fixed quantity regardless of price. The effect of the overcharge is essentially determined in 
advance, without reference to the interaction of supply and demand that complicates the determination in the general case. Id. Berghausen's complaint alleges no such ""pre-existing cost-plus contract"" and that exception to Illinois Brick therefore does 
not serve as a basis for reversal. Berghausen next asserts the ""control exception"" (Appellant's Br. at 19) to Illinois Brick might apply. He does not favor us with an 
explanation of what the ""control exception"" is, but argues ""OEMs and others may be demonstrated to be, functionally, Microsoft's 
agents in supplying licenses for Microsoft's operating systems."" Id. The Illinois Brick Court noted that ""another situation in which market forces have been superseded and the pass-on defense 
might be permitted is where the direct purchaser is owned or controlled by its customer."" 431 U.S. 720, 736 n.16. HN7[
] The 
""control exception"" applies when a defendant actually owns or exercises direct control over the direct purchaser through 
""interlocking directorates, minority stock ownership, loan agreements that subject the wholesalers to the manufacturers' 
operating control, trust agreements, or other modes of control separate from ownership of a majority of the wholesalers' common 
stock.  In re Brand Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litig., 123 F.3d 599, 605-06 (7th Cir. 1997). Berghausen does not allege 
that Microsoft owned or directly controlled Micro Center, and we accordingly find no error on that ground."
760,4," Berghausen's complaint also asserted a common law claim for restitution. A claim for restitution on behalf of indirect 
purchasers in an antitrust case implicates the same issues of multiple liability and duplicative recovery that were of concern in 
Illinois Brick, see  Federal Trade Comm'n v. Mylan Labs. Inc., 62 F. Supp. 2d 25, 43 (D.D.C. 1999), on reconsideration 99 F. 
Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 1999). The Illinois Brick decision was also premised in part on ""the difficulty of ascertaining the amount 
absorbed by any particular indirect purchaser""; given that difficulty, ""there is little basis for believing that the amount of the 
recovery would reflect the actual injury suffered."" 431 U.S. at 747. HN9[
] To prevail on a restitution claim, a plaintiff must show 
that a measurable benefit has been conferred on the defendant.  Bayh v. Sonnenburg, 573 N.E.2d 398, 408 (Ind. 1991). 
Dismissal of Berghausen's restitution claim on this basis was not error. "
761,5," Because we find Berghausen did not suffer ""antitrust injury,"" we need not address his argument that the Indiana Act did not 
require him to allege Microsoft's anticompetitive conduct took place ""within this state."" See Ind. Code §§ 24-1-2-2, 24-1-2-1. "
762,6," While Berghausen's counsel quotes the statutory language of § (a)(6), he does not acknowledge the explicit statutory 
requirement of a written or oral representation. We again admonish counsel to fairly and accurately represent the authority on 
which he relies. "
764,1," Although the chapter of the Business and Professions Code comprising sections 17200 through 17210 does not bear a 
legislatively imposed title or name, it may be referred to as the unfair competition law. ( Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. v. Lucky 
Stores, Inc. (1998) 17 Cal.4th 553, 558, fn. 2, 950 P.2d 1086.) "
766,2," ""The commissioner shall approve or issue, as adequate for all admitted workers' compensation insurers, a classification of 
risks and premium rates relating to California workers' compensation insurance. He may also approve or issue a system of merit 
rating. Such classification and system shall be uniform as to all insurers affected."" (Former Ins. Code, § 11732, as amended by 
Stats. 1977, ch. 459, § 2, p. 1514, repealed by Stats. 1993, ch. 228, § 1, p. 1793, eff. Jan. 1, 1995.) "
767,3," The plaintiffs also claim to rely upon section VII and section III, subdivision 1.(c), of the Cal Retro Plan to establish that the 
defendants' actions were unlawful, but the significance of those provisions to the plaintiffs' argument is not clear. "
773,4," In argung to the contrary, the defendants rely upon the rule that to defeat a defendant's motion for summary judgment 
regarding an alleged conspiracy to unfairly compete, a plaintiff must present evidence supporting inferences implying that an 
unlawful conspiracy is more likely than permissible competition. ( Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 857.) 
But this appeal derives from a demurrer to a pleading, not from a motion for summary judgment, and those standards have not 
been applied at the pleading stage. "
785,*," The Honorable Frank J. Magill, Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation. "
787,1, The plaintiffs no longer assert this theory on appeal.
787,2," The district court conditionally approved a proposed settlement of the domestic class action for more than $ 512 million on 
February 22, 2001 and finally approved the settlement on April 12, 2001. See  In re Auction Houses Antitrust Litig., 138 F. Supp. 
2d 548 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). "
791,3," While the treble damages action for persons injured by antitrust violations was originally enacted in section 7 of the Sherman 
Act, it was later re-enacted in 1914 as section 4 of the Clayton Act, and section 7 of the Sherman Act was repealed in 1955 as 
redundant.  Pfizer, Inc. v. Government of India, 434 U.S. 308, 311, 311 n.8, 54 L. Ed. 2d 563, 98 S. Ct. 584 (1978). "
792,4, The Sherman Act is codified at 15 U.S.C. §§ 1-7 while the Clayton Act is codified at 15 U.S.C. §§ 12-27a.
792,5," The defendants do not dispute that there was a ""direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect"" on domestic commerce. 
Therefore, we do not address the issue of how this language in the FTAIA affects the law prior to the FTAIA."
792,6," We note that HN16[
] under the FTAIA the antitrust laws regulate conduct with a ""direct, substantial, and reasonably 
foreseeable effect"" on export commerce that also meets the requirements of subsection (2) of the FTAIA. In this case, the 
plaintiffs do not allege that the defendants' conduct had such an effect, so our analysis is confined to the conduct's requisite 
""effect"" on domestic commerce. "
793,7," At first glance, the words ""a claim"" could be thought to refer exclusively to a private right of action for damages. But the word 
""claim"" has also been defined to include ""any right . . . to an equitable remedy. . . ."" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 240 (7th ed. 
1999). Moreover, subsection 2 of the FTAIA refers specifically to a claim ""under the provisions of sections 1 to 7 of this title. . . ."" 15 
U.S.C. § 6a(2). Thus, the text clearly refers to a claim brought directly pursuant to a provision of the Sherman Act. Finally, Congress has not necessarily used the word ""claim"" to refer exclusively to a private action for damages. For example, 
the Federal Trade Commission Act (the ""FTCA""), which regulates the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission (the ""FTC"") 
to bring actions against certain conduct directed at foreign markets, contains language identical to subsection 2 of the FTAIA. 
Unfair methods of competition directed at foreign markets are only actionable if they have an effect on domestic or export 
commerce and ""such effect gives rise to a claim [under the FTCA]. . . ."" See  15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(3). The FTC has the power to 
enforce the substantive provisions of the FTCA regardless of whether a plaintiff has suffered injury. See  15 U.S.C. § 45."
793,8," The defendants cite to a passage in the House Judiciary Committee Report, which noted that ""the full committee added 
language to the Sherman [Antitrust Act] . . . to require that the 'effect' providing the jurisdictional nexus must also be the basis for 
the injury alleged under the antitrust laws."" H.R. Rep. 97-686, at 11-12. But this language is consistent with the general 
requirement that the ""effect"" of the conduct cause the sort of injury protected against by the antitrust laws in the domestic market 
in order to be actionable. It does not speak to the issue of whether the particular plaintiff bringing the suit must have suffered an 
injury caused by the domestic anticompetitive effects of the conduct. It is clear that this passage is referring to the conduct of the 
defendant rather than the injury suffered by the plaintiff. The sentence immediately prior to this language notes that ""the 
Committee did not believe that the bill reported by the Subcommittee was intended to confer jurisdiction on injured foreign "
794,," persons when that injury arose from conduct with no anticompetitive effects in the domestic marketplace."" Id. at 11. This 
language implies that there is jurisdiction when the injury arises from conduct that does have a direct anticompetitive effect on 
the domestic marketplace. Finally, the Report explained that the language it added ""does not, however, mean that the impact of 
the illegal conduct must be experienced by the injured party within the United States."" Id. at 12."
794,9," One example of such a scheme might be an international cartel whose anticompetitive conduct was directed at both domestic 
and foreign markets. The FTAIA was clearly intended to regulate such conduct. As the House Judiciary Committee Report 
generally explains: Any major activities of an international cartel would likely have the requisite impact on United States commerce to trigger 
United States subject matter jurisdiction. For example, if a domestic export cartel were so strong as to have a 'spillover' 
effect on commerce within this country -- by creating a world-wide shortage or artificially inflated world-wide price that had 
the effect of raising domestic prices -- the cartel's conduct would fall within the reach of our antitrust laws. Such an impact 
would, at least over time, meet the test of a direct, substantial and reasonably foreseeable effect on domestic commerce. H.R. Rep. 97-686, at 13. "
795,10," We note that the House Judiciary Committee Report contains language consistent with this principle and cites Pfizer. As the 
Report observes: A course of conduct in the United States -- e.g., price fixing not limited to the export market -- would affect all purchasers of 
the target products or services, whether the purchaser is foreign or domestic. The conduct has the requisite effects within 
the United States, even if some purchasers take title abroad or suffer economic injury abroad. Cf., e.g., Pfizer Inc., et al v. 
Government of India, et al, 434 U.S. 308, 54 L. Ed. 2d 563, 98 S. Ct. 584 (1978). Foreign purchasers should enjoy the 
protection of our antitrust laws in the domestic marketplace, just as our citizens do. Indeed, to deny them this protection "
796,," could violate the Friendship, Commerce and Navigation treaties this country has entered into with a number of foreign 
nations. There are other reasons for preserving the rights of foreign persons to sue under our laws when the conduct in question 
has a substantial nexus to this country. As the Supreme Court pointed out in Pfizer, supra, 434 U.S. at 314-15, to deny 
foreigners a recovery could under some circumstances so limit the deterrent effect of United States antitrust law that 
defendants would continue to violate our laws, willingly risking the smaller amount of damages payable only to injured 
domestic persons. H.R. Rep. 97-686, at 10. "
798,1," Rapaport and Nethery were named in the original complaint, were the subjects of Morrow's prior appeal, and are named again 
in Morrow's second and third amended complaints. They are not parties to this appeal. Two more original defendants, 
Consolidated Medical Care, Inc. and AIG Claim Services, Inc., also were named in the first, second and third amended 
complaints and are not parties to this appeal. "
799,2," As noted in our prior opinion, under California Retrospective Premium (CRP) Policies, the premium equals actual losses and 
settlement paid and the insurer receives a claims management fee tied to settlement and loss payments. "
814,1, CDS does not allege tying. It uses the lock-in theory to justify a product market consisting of only one brand of computers. 
816,2," IBM made this argument with respect to Claim I, as well. Since that Claim has been dismissed, these arguments no longer 
apply to Claim I. "
824,1, J. Sollner is not a party to this case. It is unclear whether there is a subsidiary relationship between J. Sollner and Bionic.
824,2, Neither Wittel nor MPI are parties to this case.
824,3, Fresenius is not a party to this case.
824,4," The letter from Ralf Jungmann to John Ferszt, Exh. F to the Amended Complaint, alleges that ""Medical Profiles [MPI] was sold 
in-between to the Futura group as new shareholder."" "
825,5," According to the Amended Complaint, prior to negotiations between First Med and Fresenius, Fresenius had been purchasing 
its injection caps from Futura for $ 15.21 per box (100 injection caps per box). The negotiated price from First Med, per the April 
2001 agreement, was $ 12.63 per box, and if the invoice was paid within 10 days, an additional 1% discount would be applied."
825,6," The letter is somewhat ambiguous, as it does not clarify whether Futura is the exclusive distributorship in the U.S. and Canada, 
or whether it is simply the ""single authorized supply channel"" to Fresenius. Plaintiff alleges that after the May 30, 2001 exclusive 
distributorship was allegedly formed, Bionic sold injection caps to other distributors in the U.S., naming Kendall as an example. 
(Amended Compl. PP 51-52.) "
830,7," This doctrine has been denigrated by at least one commentator (Jacobson & Greer, supra, at 299-302), as its logic is in direct 
conflict with the words of the statute (15 U.S.C. § 1) and the purpose behind punishing antitrust violations. "
831,8," See 128 F.3d at 402 n.3 (""The case at bar presents serious questions as to whether the HFS franchise package constitutes a 
product that is separate and distinct from the logoed amenities, and would thus be capable of serving as a 'tying product' for 
such amenities . . ..""). "
832,9," This result is supported by a Sixth Circuit recent opinion. Without discussing, referring to, or even citing Axis, Hodges, or Valley 
Products, the Sixth Circuit held, in Schwartz v. Sun Co., 276 F.3d 900, 903-05 (6th Cir. 2002), that even though there was 
evidence that tended to show that the plaintiff's losses were either the result of the defendant's antitrust violation, or ""other 
factors,"" the plaintiff had still met the antitrust injury requirement. The dissent (Suhrheinrich, J.) concluded that the antitrust injury 
component was not met, as the district court had concluded, because there was not sufficient evidence that the lost sales 
resulted solely due to the antitrust violation. See id. at 905-06. See also In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litigation, 105 F. Supp. 2d 618, 650 (E.D. Mich. 2000) (""To establish antitrust injury, 
Plaintiffs are not required to eliminate the hypothetical possibility that Defendant Andrx might have unilaterally delayed entry into 
the market even absent the [challenged] agreement.""). "
834,10," Futura Defendants assert that because Plaintiff has not alleged that Futura and Bionic conspired to set prices ""in the entire 
market place"" (Futura Def.'s Reply, at 4, emphasis in original), Plaintiff's per se claim fails, citing Ezzo's Investments Inc. v. 
Royal Beauty Supply, 243 F.3d 980 (6th Cir. 2001) and Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 99 
L. Ed. 2d 808, 108 S. Ct. 1515 (1988). Neither of those cases require price fixing for the entire market. "

846,5," A less vivid but closer parallel is a situation in which dealers or franchises, by control or coercion, make the manufacturer or

849,10," Indeed, by June 1999, players' economic expert, Roger Noll, had concluded that the relevant market was limited to U.S. 
Division I soccer; he did not attempt to define any alternative market, nor did he suggest that MLS might exercise market power 
in some broader market. "
850,11," It is well-settled that a party claiming that an instruction should have been given forfeits the objection if the instruction it 
tenders is itself objectionable. See  Savard v. Marine Contracting, Inc., 471 F.2d 536, 540 (2d Cir. 1972). "

852,13," Players also introduced the league's 1993 business plan, in which MLS asserted that it would be able to maintain its salary 
structure because ""it is not anticipated that there will be any other significant domestic professional league to compete for 
players' services."" Another document allowed in evidence, a December 1994 offering memorandum, said ""MLS believes it will be 
able to maintain this salary structure because of the competitiveness of the salary and benefit package and the lack of 
comparable alternatives in the United States to players."" "
853,14," For example, on cross-examination Farnsworth admitted that he could not be certain whether his player had actually ever 
received an offer from MLS. Similarly, he admitted he could not be sure whether the MLS player he was recruiting actually had 
an offer to play in MLS the following season. "

861,1, Defendants Hoogenstyn and Sanford additionally asserted that plaintiff owed them commissions. 
862,2," The trial court's order granting defendants partial summary disposition stated that it was based on MCR 2.116(C)(10). While 
the trial court indicated at the hearing on defendants' motion that it found summary disposition appropriate pursuant to MCR 
2.116(C)(8), we note that the trial court's ruling rested on the fact that defendants were independent contractors of plaintiff, which 
fact defendants proved by referring to documents outside the pleadings, i.e., to plaintiff's responses to defendants' requests to 
admit. Accordingly, we construe defendants' motion as being granted pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(10).   Krass v Tri-County 
Security, Inc, 233 Mich. App. 661, 664-665; 593 N.W.2d 578 (1999)."
862,3," Section 2 of the MARA was derived from section 2 of the Uniform State Antitrust Act, the comment to which provides, in 
relevant part, as follows: This section gathers together and proscribes all concerted or collusive conduct in unreasonable restraint of trade, as under the 
common law and section 1 of the Sherman Act [15 USC 1], and to monopolize trade, as under section 2 of the Sherman Act [15 
USC 2]. In adopting the Sherman Act terms, ""contract combination, or conspiracy,"" this section is designed to cover all 
concerted activities, formal or informal, including sale, contract to sell, purchase, contract to purchase, lease, contract to lease, 
license, contract to license, trust, pool, or holding company. The adoption of Sherman Act language establishes its general 
standards of legality, provides needed flexibility, and makes available to state courts the relevant body of federal precedent. [7C 
ULA (Master Edition, 2000), p 357.] "
863,4," The language of § 1 of the Sherman Act quoted in Standard Oil, supra at 49-50, appears substantially similar to the current 
language of 15 USC 1. Section 1 of the Sherman Act currently provides as follows: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several 
States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any contract or engage in any 
combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be 
punished by fine not exceeding $ 10,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any other person, $ 350,000, or by imprisonment not 
exceeding three years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court. "
866,5," The detractors of HB 4072 explained as follows: The bill is not necessary. The public interest and rights of employees and employers would be sufficiently well served, as they 
are in many other states, by the common law test of reasonableness, which courts would employ in the absence of a specific 
statute on post-employment covenants. This test would weigh the various interests of employer, employee, and the public on a 
case-by-case basis. As articulated in a dissenting opinion filed with a 1976 Michigan Supreme Court decision, ""a non-
competition forfeiture clause is a reasonable restraint of trade only if it 1) is no greater than necessary for the protection of the 
legitimate interests of the employer; 2) does not impose undue hardship on the employee; and 3) is not injurious to the interests 
of the public."" Indeed, the bill's vagueness and reliance on a general test of reasonableness ensure that disputes will continue to 
arise and be resolved by the courts. [House Legislative Analysis, supra.] "
867,6," As the comment explains, the drafters of § 2 of the Uniform State Antitrust Act modeled it on the Sherman Act's restraint of 
trade provision, intending to ""make[] available to state courts the relevant body of federal precedent."" 7C ULA, supra at 357. As 
we have examined, the rule of reason has constituted a part of decisions under the Sherman Act for nearly one hundred years. "
878,1," In Baxter's motion to vacate Baxter also objects to the foreign arbitrators. We agree with Abbott that Baxter's argument as to 
the foreign arbitrators is untimely and thus constitutes a waiver precluding judicial review. Health Serv. Mgmt. Corp. v. Hughes, 
975 F.2d 1253, 1263-64 (7th Cir. 1992). Furthermore, the composition of the panel was dictated by the parties agreement. "
892,1," HN3[
] The relationship between federal antitrust law and the 1996 Act is made clear by the very language of the 1996 Act: Section 601(c)(1) states that the Act ""shall not be construed to modify, impair, or supersede Federal, State or local law unless 
expressly so provided."" Telecommunications Act of 1996, § 601, 110 Stat. 56 (1996). Furthermore, Section 601(b)(1) of the 1996 
Act states that nothing in the Act ""shall be construed to modify, impair, or supersede the applicability of any of the antitrust laws."" 
Id., § 601(b)(1). HN4[
] Since antitrust laws represent a ""fundamental national economic policy,"" industry regulations do not generally render 
antitrust laws inapplicable to the industry.  Square D. Co. v. Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau Inc., 476 U.S. 409, 421, 90 L. Ed. 2d 
413, 106 S. Ct. 1922 (1986). When determining whether the repeal of antitrust laws can be inferred, the Fourth Circuit employs a 
two-part analysis: (1) Is there an ""affirmative showing of a legislative intent to repeal,"" and (2) is there a showing that federal 
antitrust laws and the regulatory scheme in question cannot be reconciled? North Carolina ex rel. Edmisten v. P.I.A. Ashville, "
893,," Inc., 740 F.2d 274, 280 (4th Cir. 1984) (citing Gerimedical Hospital and Gerontology Center v. Blue Cross of Kansas City, 628 
F.2d 1050 (8th Cir. 1980), reversed, 452 U.S. 378, 382-83, 69 L. Ed. 2d 89, 101 S. Ct. 2415 (1981)). No such inference can be drawn from the 1996 Act. The language of the 1996 Act makes it clear that no legislative intent to 
repeal federal antitrust laws existed. Furthermore, while the 1996 Act imposes more specific duties on ILECs than those found in 
antitrust laws, those duties ""do not conflict with the antitrust laws. . . ."" Goldwasser v. Ameritech Corp., 222 F.3d 390, 401 (7th 
Cir. 2000). Given that the intent the 1996 Act was to foster more competition in the telecommunications market, the purpose 
underlying the 1996 Act can be reconciled with federal antitrust laws."
893,2," Ultimately, in Goldwasser, the Seventh Circuit upheld the district court's dismissal of a monopolization claim under § 2 of the 
Sherman Act on grounds that the claim did nothing more than state alleged violations of the 1996 Act. Goldwasser, 222 F.3d at 
402. "
894,3," Cavalier's allegation that Verizon employees contacted Cavalier's existing and potential customers in an attempt to draw 
business away from Cavalier is the single factual allegation in the Complaint that addresses anti-competitive behavior and does 
not concern a duty imposed by the 1996 Act. However, this issue alone, when coupled with the multiple violations of the 1996 
Act that Cavalier basically alleges without referencing the Act itself, is not enough to support a monopolization claim. In fact, the Goldwasser court faced a similar scenario. After determining that many of the claims detailed in that complaint fell 
outside of antitrust and within the parameters of the 1996 Act, the Seventh Circuit dismissed a more general antitrust claim on 
the basis that it was ""inextricably linked"" to other claims. Goldwasser, 222 F.3d at 400. Cavalier's claim that Verizon employees contacted current or potential Cavalier customers and made certain misrepresentations 
-- although it cannot be properly characterized as a general antitrust claim -- suffers the same fate. In fact, Cavalier makes this 
allegation as an illustration of how Verizon's ordering process has resulted in ""marketing disadvantages"" for Cavalier. Complaint, 
PP 66-71. As a result, the allegation itself represents, at best, an extension of Cavalier's contentions about ordering -- an issue 
covered by the 1996 Act and its mandate that Verizon provide interconnection, unbundled access, and collocation under 
reasonable rates and conditions. "
895,4," Verizon's actions, as detailed in Cavalier's Complaint, also do not rise to the level of predatory behavior. In Aspen Skiing Co. v. 
Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467, 105 S. Ct. 2847 (1985), the Supreme Court recognized that 
HN13[
] monopolists have a qualified right to do business with whom they choose.  Id. at 602-3. Exclusionary or predatory "
896,," conduct, however, does not fall within the contours of this qualified right. Id. at 602-5. Predatory conduct ""(1) tends to impair the 
opportunities of rivals, but also (2) either does not further competition on the merits or does so in an unnecessarily restrictive 
way."" Id. at 605 n.32 (quoting 3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law 78 (1978)). Cavalier's allegations concern the manner in which Verizon is meeting its responsibilities under the 1996 Act. Although some of 
Cavalier's claims do contain egregious allegations of violations of the 1996 Act, its contentions are generally about the quality of 
the services and facilities offered. Claims that a particular process is overly complex, that overbilling has occurred, and that 
certain databases and interfaces contain inaccurate information do not amount to predatory conduct."
896,5," Cavalier also bases part of its monopolization claim on a section of the Virginia authorizing treble damages for willful conduct. 
Va. Code § 59.1-9.12(b). But, since the Virginia Antitrust Act is to be harmonized with federal antitrust law, Cavalier's state law 
antitrust claims must fail if its federal antitrust claims fail. Oksanen v. Page Memorial Hospital, 945 F.2d 696, 710 (4th Cir. 1991)."
896,6," HN14[
] A claim for attempted monopolization under § 2 of the Sherman Act has three elements: (1) the specific intent to monopolize the relevant market, (2) predatory or anti-competitive acts, and (3) a ""dangerous probability"" of success. M&M 
Medical Supplies & Services, Inc. v. Pleasant Valley Hospital, Inc., 981 F.2d 160, 166 (4th Cir. 1992). "
897,7," The Fifth Circuit, for example, examined the issue in Seven-Up Co. v. Coca-Cola Co., 86 F.3d 1379 (5th Cir. 1996), indicating 
that informal types of promotion can classify as ""commercial advertising"" if such promotion is done for the purpose of promoting 
and product and is ""disseminated sufficiently"" within the particular industry.  Id. 86 F.3d at 1284-85 (quoting Gordon & Breach, 
859 F. Supp. at 1535-36). Indeed, § 43(a) can apply to fund-raising letters and even to instances where a person badmouths a 
former employer in telephone calls to friends and colleagues. See  Gordon & Breach, 859 F. Supp. at 1535 (citations omitted)."
897,8," Cavalier requests an award of monetary damages under § 207, attorney's fees under § 206, $ 500 million in punitive damages, 
and a permanent injunction on this count."
897,9," HN19[
] Section 252 allows carriers to enter into binding agreements and § 251, in addition to establishing specific duties and obligations, indicates that carriers must provide interconnection under terms that are ""just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement and the requirements of this section and section 252."" 47 U.S.C. § 
251(c)(3). The Fourth Circuit has recently indicated that § 252 confers jurisdiction on federal courts to review ""determinations"" made by the 
State Commission and whether the interconnection agreement meets the conditions set out in § 251.  Bell Atlantic Md., Inc. v. 
MCI Worldcom, Inc., 240 F.3d 279, 302-3 (4th Cir. 2001). Consequently, Cavalier argues, § 252 is only a limited remedy. 
Furthermore, §§ 206 and 207 allow Cavalier to bring suit for money damages in federal court, provided it has not already "
898,," brought suit before the FCC. Conboy v. AT&T Corp., 84 F. Supp. 2d 492, 497-98 (S.D.N.Y. 2000), aff'd, 241 F.3d 242 (2d Cir. 
2001). In fact, it seems clear that §§ 251 and 252 do not override §§ 206 and 207, even when it comes to obligations set out under § 
251.  Law Offices of Curtis v. Trinko, 123 F. Supp. 2d 738, 743 (S.D.N.Y. 2000). In Trinko, the court indicated that violations of § 
251 are still cognizable as § 207 claims. Id. at 742-43. At the same time, the Trinko court seemed to suggest that HN20[
] §§"
898,206, and 207 should not be used to circumvent the regulatory provisions of §§ 251 and 252. Id.
898,10," Verizon also argues that, even though § 401(b) does apply to the Merger Order, it does not allow a party to collect damages. 
Conboy, 241 F.3d at 252. It only allows for the enforcement of orders. Id. This point is moot, since, in its Memorandum in 
Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, Cavalier withdrew its claims for damages under § 401(b)."
898,11," HN22[
] The SCC has authority over interconnection agreements and disputes arising from them. Bell Atlantic Md., 240 F.3d at 304."
898,12," "". . . HN23[
] § 252(e)(6) confers jurisdiction on federal courts to review State commission 'determinations' under § 252 'to determine whether the agreement. . .meets the requirements of section 251 and this section [252].'"" Bell Atlantic Md., 240 F.3d 
at 302 (quoting 47 U.S.C. § 252(e)(6)). "
899,13," It is also not clear that there is an issue of federal law involved in this alleged breach of contract that would support a claim of 
federal jurisdiction. Indeed, the Fourth Circuit has indicated that HN24[
] the fact that interconnection agreements are created 
under federal law does not confer federal question jurisdiction on disputes over interconnection agreements. Bell Atlantic Md., 
240 F.3d at 308."
899,14," Cavalier makes two basic assertions: (1) The contract dispute at issue does not necessitate special expertise on the part of 
the Court and (2) the agency in question cannot grant the relief sought. In regard to the first issue, Cavalier acknowledges that resolution of the contract dispute will likely involve some discussion of 
telecommunications policy and the reasonableness of Verizon's conduct. However, it asserts that alleged misconduct -- double-
billing, overly complex billing practices, erroneous telephone listings, and delayed performance -- does not rise to the level of 
sophistication that requires the expertise of the FCC or SCC. The Eleventh Circuit has recently indicated that allowing state commissions the sole power to interpret and enforce 
interconnection agreements basically relegates the regulation of local telephone service to these commissions. BellSouth 
Telecommunications, Inc. v. MCIMetro Access Transmission Services, Inc., et al., 278 F.3d 1223, 1236 (11th Cir. 2002). Such a 
wide grant of power to state commissions goes beyond the intent of Congress to give state commissions a limited role in 
regulation and exceeds the expertise of such commissions. Id. A state commission, lacking any knowledge of contract law, could 
violate ""the most basic tenets of contract interpretation"" and still remain free from judicial review since § 252(e)(6) limits judicial 
review to determinations of whether interconnection agreements comport with §§ 251 and 252. Id. Cavalier also argues that the SCC cannot offer complete relief, so the Court should retain jurisdiction over the contract dispute. 
United States v. AT&T Co., 461 F. Supp. 1314, 1328 n.43 (D.D.C. 1978) (stating that ""it is not insignificant that, even with 
respect to that portion of defendants' activities which the Commission does regulate, only the courts can grant complete relief""). 
Cavalier seeks monetary damages, which the SCC acknowledges it cannot award. See SCC Order in Cavalier Telephone, LLC 
v. Bell Atlantic-Virginia, Inc., Case. No. PUC990191 (June 15, 2000)."
899,15," Cavalier argues that Virginia is not the principal place of business for Cavalier. Consequently, it asserts that Cavalier is not a 
corporate citizen of Virginia and diversity does exist between Cavalier and Verizon. "
911,1," The parties have used different terms for this transaction. The defendants refer to it as a ""mandatory share redemption,"" while 
the plaintiff prefers ""freeze-out."" My use of the former does not imply any opinion as to the merits or demerits of this transaction."
911,2," The complaint identifies J.P. Morgan & Co. and Chase Manhattan Corp. as separate defendants. As represented in the 
Memorandum in Support of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s Motion to Dismiss (""Morgan Mem.""), these two defendants merged on 
December 31, 2000. Morgan Mem. at 1 n.1."
911,3," At an earlier point in these proceedings, I granted a motion of Summers to substitute the current Secretary of the Treasury, 
Paul O'Neill (""O'Neill""), for Summers to the extent that the claims are against Summers in his official capacity. Although the 
complaint itself is unclear on the matter, the plaintiff argues that his claims against Summers are made against him both in his 
official capacity and in his individual capacity. See Plaintiff's Consolidated Opposition to All Motions To Dismiss and Related 
Motions, Including Request for Jury Trial on Any Unresolved Issues Relating to Arbitration (""Consolidated Opp'n"") at 59. "
913,4," The ESF is a fund created by Congress, which, ""subject to approval by the President, … is under the exclusive control of the 
Secretary"" of the Treasury. 31 U.S.C. § 5302(a)(2). The fund was originally established in 1934 with a $ 2 billion appropriation. 
Gold Reserve Act of 1934, § 10(b), 48 Stat. 337, 341-42 (1934). The original purpose of the ESF was to ""stabilize the exchange 
value of the dollar."" Id., § 10(a), 48 Stat. at 341. To this end, Congress authorized the Secretary to ""deal in gold, foreign 
exchange, and other instruments of credit and securities the Secretary considers necessary,"" a power he retains to this day. 31 
U.S.C. § 5302(b)."
913,5," See Shaw v. Digital Equipment Corp., 82 F.3d 1194, 1220 (1st Cir. 1996) (""In deciding a motion to dismiss a securities action, a 
court may properly consider the relevant entirety of a document integral to or explicitly relied upon in the complaint, even though 
not attached to the complaint, without converting the motion into one for summary judgment.""). "
914,6," The parties agree that subsequent to the filing of the complaint, ""on January 8, 2001, an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) 
of the BIS unanimously approved the mandatory redemption transaction. As of that date … the registrations of all privately held 
shares were cancelled on the books of the BIS and replaced by a statutory right to payment…."" BIS Mot. at 6. "
915,7," Section 4 provides for threefold damages: HN6[
] ""Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor ? and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained…."" 15 
U.S.C. § 15(a). Section 16 permits injunctive relief: HN7[
] ""Any person … shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, 
in any court of the United States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the 
antitrust laws….""). 15 U.S.C. § 26."
915,8," McDonough also argues that this court lacks jurisdiction over his person. In view of my disposition of the present motions, I do 
not need to reach the personal jurisdiction issue. "
919,9," While not ruling on this specific issue, a Supreme Court decision formed the basis for the seminal Sea-Land decision. See Sea-
Land Service, Inc. v. Alaska Railroad, 212 U.S. App. D.C. 197, 659 F.2d 243, 246 (D.C. Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 919, 
71 L. Ed. 2d 459, 102 S. Ct. 1274 (1982). In United States v. Cooper Corp., 312 U.S. 600, 85 L. Ed. 1071, 61 S. Ct. 742 (1941), 
the Court held that HN18[
] the United States was not a ""person"" under the provision that allowed an injured person to sue for 
treble damages under the antitrust laws, noting that if the United States qualified as a person under this provision, then it would 
also be a ""person"" subject to Sherman Act liability.  Id. at 606. In 1955, HN19[
] Congress amended the Clayton Act to 
authorize suits by the United States for actual, but not treble, damages under the antitrust laws. Pub. L. No. 84-137, 69 Stat. 283 
(1955); see Sea-Land, 659 F.2d at 245. Congress did not, however, amend the definition of ""person"" under the Sherman Act to 
include the United States. See Sea-Land, 659 F.2d at 246-47 (""Congress had a clear occasion to address the issue in 1955 but 
failed to do so…. We believe a court should not infer such a judgment from the silence of Congress."")."
919,10," Although the First Circuit has not considered whether federal agencies or officers fall within the definition of ""persons"" in the 
antitrust laws, one case, cited in Jet Courier Services v. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, 713 F.2d 1221, 1228 (6th Cir. 1983), 
suggests that the First Circuit would agree with the other circuits at least as concerns the Federal Reserve Bank. See  Federal 
Reserve Bank of Boston v. Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation, 499 F.2d 60, 62 (1st Cir. 1972) (""Federal reserve banks 
… are plainly and predominantly fiscal arms of the federal government. Their interests seem indistinguishable from those of the 
sovereign.""). "
920,11," The Pennhurst case dealt with the scope of Eleventh Amendment immunity of state officials, but the ultra vires analysis is the 
same in this context. See  Kozera, 723 F.2d at 1008 n.4. "
934,1," In the ""float process,"" a continuous ribbon of molten glass floats on a liquid of greater density than the glass; normally the 
denser liquid is molten tin.  Flat Glass, 191 F.R.D. at 475-76 n.7. The glass is then polished under controlled temperatures and 
cooled in an annealing oven. Id."
934,2," Although appellees also moved to dismiss the complaint on the alternative ground that it was barred by the applicable statute 
of limitations, the trial court did not decide that issue. We therefore do not consider it here. See  Jett v. City of Tucson, 180 Ariz. 
115, 123-24, 882 P.2d 426, 434-35 (1994) HN1[
] (appellate court will not address issue not resolved by the trial court). "
935,3," We acknowledge that HN8[
] even if indirect purchasers are barred from bringing actions under A.R.S. § 44-1408(B), ""a person"" or ""an individual"" would likely be the direct purchaser in a situation in which it is the intermediate entities that are 
conspiring to fix prices. The statutory language of ""a person"" would have greater effect in that situation. "
936,4," We disagree with Bunker Glass's interpretation of the ""directly or indirectly"" language in the constitution. This language 
prohibits business entities from ""directly or indirectly"" combining or making contracts to fix prices, limit the production, or regulate 
the transportation of any product or commodity. It does not address whether the illegal conduct affects purchasers directly or 
indirectly. "
937,5," Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15 (1976), provides: HN14[
] Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may 
sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, 
without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, 
including a reasonable attorney's fee."
937,6," Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1 (1976), provides in part: HN15[
] Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among 
the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. "
938,7," The ARC America Court stated that the statutes of Alabama, California, and Minnesota expressly allowed indirect purchasers 
to sue.  490 U.S. at 98 n.3. The Court further noted that while the Arizona statute generally followed the language of the Clayton

not have to interpret the Arizona statute to reach its holding and therefore expressed no opinion on this question of Arizona law.

938,8," The second sentence of A.R.S. § 44-1412 does not appear in the Uniform State Antitrust Act. It was added by our legislature 
when adopting the uniform act. Unif. Antitrust Act § 12, 7C U.L.A. 369, Action in Adopting Jurisdictions (Master ed. 2000). "
939,9," Compare, for example, the language of A.R.S. § 44-1412, the Arizona ""guidance"" statute, with some of the more strongly 
worded provisions of other states: 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 10/11 (West 1993) (""When the wording of this Act is identical or 
similar to that of a federal antitrust law, the courts of this State shall use the construction of the federal law by the federal courts 
as a guide in construing this Act.""); Mich. Stat. Ann. § 28.70(14)(2) (Michie 1990) (""In construing all sections of this Act, the 
courts shall give due deference to interpretations given by federal courts as a guide . . . .""); Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 598A.050 
(Michie Supp. 1999) (""The provisions of this chapter shall be construed in harmony with prevailing judicial interpretations given 
by federal courts to comparable antitrust statutes.""); Wash. Rev. Code § 19.86.920 (1989) (""It is the intent of the legislature that, 
in construing this act, the courts be guided by final decisions of the federal courts and final orders of the federal trade 
commission interpreting the various federal statutes dealing with the same or similar matters . . . .""). "
940,10," Although at least one other federal circuit court held in the early 1970s that an indirect purchaser could not bring a price-fixing 
action, see  Mangano v. Am. Radiator & Standard Sanitary Corp., 438 F.2d 1187, 1188 (3d Cir. 1971), we presume that the 
Arizona legislature would have considered the holding in Western Liquid Asphalt Cases to be the guide for Arizona law both 
because Arizona is located in the Ninth Circuit and because the State of Arizona as well as several Arizona cities were involved 
in that litigation."

947,1," Defendants' motion focuses almost exclusively on the expert report and testimony of Dr. Beyer. Dr. French is an associate of 
Dr. Beyer, and offered his opinions when only Northwest was involved in this action. Because Dr. French and Dr. Beyer 
allegedly use the same approach in arriving at their conclusions, and because Dr. Beyer's later work summarizes and 
incorporates Dr. French's prior work, Defendants contend that Dr. French's earlier work should be excluded as suffering from 
many of the same defects as the later, more comprehensive work of Dr. Beyer. In light of this derivative challenge to Dr. 
French's testimony, the remainder of this Opinion addresses only the testimony of Dr. Beyer."
947,2," The Court ordered that these briefs not exceed 10 pages in length. However, on March 9, 2001, Plaintiffs filed a motion 
requesting the Court's permission to exceed this limit by three pages. Having reviewed Plaintiffs' motion and the expanded brief 
that accompanies it, the Court grants the motion, and agrees to accept Plaintiffs' lengthier brief for filing. "
948,3," The Court notes, however, that Dr. Beyer does not opine whether Defendants and others in fact engaged in a conspiracy to 
enforce their prohibitions on hidden-city ticketing, but only as to the economic and antitrust implications of such a conspiracy, 
assuming it exists. "
949,4," To be accurate, Dr. Beyer employs a ""minimum average"" methodology in calculating the so-called ""hub premiums"" that the 
Airlines allegedly are imposing upon their hub-spoke passengers. The precise details of this methodology are not germane to 
the Court's present inquiry."
949,5," Unfortunately, the parties agreed on a somewhat outdated standard, failing to recognize in their initial submissions that the 
relevant Federal Rules of Evidence were amended effective December 1, 2000, just a few days after Defendants filed their 
motion. The Court's invitation for the parties to file post-hearing supplemental briefs was intended in part to address this 
oversight. "
950,6," In their briefs, the parties direct the Court's attention to prior cases in which Dr. Beyer's expert testimony was either rejected or 
cited with approval. Compare, e.g.,  Blue Cross & Blue Shield United v. Marshfield Clinic, 152 F.3d 588, 593 (7th Cir. 1998) 
(""Beyer's two reports . . . are worthless.""), with  In re Domestic Air Transp. Antitrust Litigation, 137 F.R.D. 677, 686-87 (N.D. "
951,," Ga. 1991) (finding that Dr. Beyer was a ""convincing and credible expert witness,"" and expressing ""agreement with Dr. Beyer's 
analysis of the [airline] industry""). Plainly, however, the admissibility or exclusion of Dr. Beyer's expert testimony in other cases 
has no bearing whatsoever on the Court's inquiry in the present case. "
952,7," The 1996 report posits that this difference is attributable to the fact that a passenger traveling a longer hub-spoke route is more 
likely to consider the option of taking another airline's connecting spoke-hub-spoke route to achieve the same result, while such 
a connecting flight likely would not be considered as a reasonable alterative for short-distance travel."
952,8," Plaintiffs further assert, as discussed below, that Defendants' prohibition on hidden-city ticketing is one of the means through 
which the Airlines preserve their purported monopoly power at their hubs, and that the effect of this particular exercise of alleged 
monopoly power can be measured by examining the savings achievable through hidden-city ticketing. "
953,9," As noted at the March 1 hearing, Dr. Beyer has little to offer as proof that he performed such an analysis. He did note, 
however, that there was one tangible product of this analysis -- specifically, his decision to treat the Baltimore/Washington airport 
as part of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan market, even though it does not lie within this metropolitan area."
953,10," Specifically, an affidavit provided by Mark A. Drusch of Delta Air Lines identifies some specific cases where the airports in a 
single metropolitan area -- Los Angeles, for example -- seemingly have been treated as distinct for pricing purposes, and where 
airports in different metropolitan areas -- Cincinnati and Dayton, for example -- have been considered as competitive for pricing 
purposes. (See Drusch Decl. at PP 13-18.) The affidavits submitted on behalf of Northwest and US Airways, however, are not 
nearly as informative on this issue. In addition, Dr. Beyer's most recent affidavit explains why, in his view, Defendants' fare 
comparisons do not necessarily bear upon the question whether passengers consider two nearby airports to be substitutes for 
each other. (See Beyer 1/23/01 Aff. at P 19.) "
954,11," In fact, in the city-pairs examined by Dr. Beyer as relevant markets, he notes that ""the defendants' [market] share is typically 
substantially above 50 percent."" (Id. at P 45.) Plaintiffs further observe that a 50-percent market share, standing alone, produces 
a Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (""HHI"") of 2500 for such a market, which is considered under the Department of Justice Merger 
Guidelines to be a ""highly concentrated"" market. As an aside, the parties and their experts agree that the HHI is a widely used measure of market concentration. The HHI is the 
sum of the squared market shares of all firms in the market. Thus, in a market divided equally between two firms, the HHI would 
be (50)<2> + (50)<2> = 2500 + 2500 = 5000, and a market entirely dominated by a single firm would produce an HHI of 
(100)<2> = 10,000. "
956,12," In fact, Defendants point out that some of the hidden-city routes used by Dr. Beyer as benchmarks had little or no traffic during 
some of the time periods covered in his analysis. "
957,13," A ""back-haul"" exists whenever a route ""flies past"" the final destination as it connects at a hub. For example, a spoke-spoke 
route between Albany, New York and Richmond, Virginia that passes through a hub in Atlanta would include a ""back-haul,"" since 
Atlanta is south of Richmond. More generally, the parties' submissions speak of ""circuity,"" which is a measure of the degree to 
which passengers are routed out of their way as they travel between spokes via a connecting hub."
957,14," As to this latter point, Dr. Beyer notes that Defendants' spoke-spoke fares generally, though not precisely, correlate with the 
distance between origin and destination. (See id. at P 41.) He reasons, therefore, that spoke-spoke routes that involve longer 
distances between the hub and the final spoke destination are less likely to yield hidden-city savings, because cost factors tend 
to dominate over other considerations as the travel distance increases. (See id. at P 42.) "
958,15," More precisely, and as alluded to earlier, Dr. Beyer used ""minimum averaging"" to calculate damages. Under this approach, for 
each hub-spoke market, Dr. Beyer computed the average hidden-city savings percentage for each fare code on a quarterly 
basis. Dr. Beyer then chose the fare code that achieved the smallest average savings percentage as his benchmark for the "
959,," alleged anticompetitive overcharge for that quarter. For example, upon reviewing the Albany-Atlanta market on the date of 
September 19, 1995, Dr. Beyer found that the average savings percentages under the six applicable fare codes ranged from 
11.5 to 14 percent. He used the smallest of these averages -- 11.5 percent -- as the alleged overcharge imposed by Defendant 
Delta on its passengers traveling between Albany and Atlanta during this quarter in 1995. "
960,16," For instance, as to Defendants' contention that they might choose to raise their spoke-spoke fares rather than lowering their 
hub-spoke fares, Dr. Beyer opines that this is unlikely, where competitive concerns and reduced barriers to entry would militate 
against fare increases on the spoke-spoke routes."
960,17," Moreover, on this point, as on others, the Court questions Defendants' apparent premise that Dr. Beyer's opinion must be 
accepted in total in order to sustain an award of damages. In particular, Defendants seem to suggest that any variance in their 
market-by-market responses in the ""but-for"" world would fatally undermine Dr. Beyer's theory of damages. The Court fails to see 
why this is so. It is common in civil litigation for plaintiffs to offer a ""worst-case scenario"" theory of damages, and for defendants 
to respond that, even if a wrong was committed, the plaintiffs suffered no damages. The trier of fact generally is then free to 
award damages within the range established by the parties' proofs. The situation is no different here, where Dr. Beyer has 
opined that, in the absence of hidden-city prohibitions, the plaintiff class would have captured much of the savings reflected in 
the Airlines' present-day hidden-city fares, and where Defendants respond that they might well have chosen to adopt a course of 
conduct -- e.g., raising their fares on the spoke-spoke hidden-city routes -- that would have eliminated any such savings 
opportunities. "
962,18," In fact, there is a degree of inconsistency in Defendants' complaint on this score. They generally assert that hidden-city fares, 
whether they reflect ""positive"" or ""negative"" savings opportunities, have nothing at all to say about what hub-spoke fares would 
be in the ""but-for"" world. Seemingly, then, this defect is not cured by the inclusion of more hidden-city fares in the calculation."
962,19," Viewed from this perspective, Dr. Beyer's ""minimum average"" approach arguably underestimates Plaintiffs' damages, since it 
is based upon the fare code that achieved the smallest average savings percentage during a given quarter. The Airlines 
arguably might be compelled to reduce their fares below this point, down to the level of the lowest available hidden-city fare, in 
order to prevent passengers from availing themselves of this maximum hidden-city savings opportunity."
962,20," As should be evident from this and similar qualifying language throughout this Opinion, it is by no means definitively resolved 
that the trier of fact will be permitted to consider each and every aspect of Dr. Beyer's testimony. Rather, under a more complete 
record at trial, the Court might well conclude what it is unable to conclude here -- namely, that Dr. Beyer's testimony fails, on one 
or more issues, in whole or in part, to satisfy the admissibility standards set forth in Rule 702. "
967,1," Poly-America was also a named defendant in the action. However, pursuant to a Stipulation and Order dated August 1, 2001 
[Docket No. 52] all claims against it were dismissed with prejudice. "
968,2," Because the Court found that plaintiff was an inadequate class representative which independently disposed of plaintiff's 
motion for class certification, the Court did not reach the predominance and superiority requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)."
968,3," The S & S Forage complaint differs from the Steward in that it does not include a customer allocation claim. Class Action 
Complaint at P 17. "
970,4," For instance, Beers recalls a conversation with Ross in April 1992 in which Ross reinforced the need to keep Up North's 
arrangement with Ag-Bag secret and that they needed to be careful how and what was discussed ""because nobody needed to--
to wind up in jail."" Beers Depo. at 316."
970,5," Although defendants emphasize that the testimony of Masood later changed, the Court believes that any inconsistencies in 
Masood's testimony is a matter for the jury to resolve, not this Court on a summary judgment motion. "
971,6," The deposition testimony provides: Q: Did the two companies agree to give each other early notice of what their prices were going to be? A: There was some information to be traded back and forth. Q: And this information was to be traded before the public at large was notified of it? A: Yes. Q: Was this pricing information? A: Yes. Q: Was the arrangement then that before Ag Bag released its prices to its dealers and customers and territorial 
managers it would first send a copy of the price list to Up North? A: Yes. Q: And Up North would do the same? A: Yes. Masood Depo. at 69-70. "
1011,1, Defendant Manufacturers and Defendant Buyers are referred to collectively as Defendants. 
1012,2," The court will determine the propriety of class certification based on the extensive briefs and exhibits submitted by the parties. 
An evidentiary hearing on class certification is unnecessary, as both parties have thoroughly briefed their positions. The court notes that Defendants have submitted a motion to strike deposition errata sheets filed by Plaintiffs, which seek to 
provide further explanation of deposition testimony. In addition, Plaintiffs filed a motion to strike certain portions of Defendants' 
rebuttal expert report and for other sanctions related to Defendants' alleged failure to timely provide USDA grade information 
from the Tobinet. The court will consider these motions in a separate order, but notes that it has not considered either the errata 
sheets submitted by Plaintiffs nor the contested portions of the rebuttal expert report in arriving at the class certification decision. "
1013,3," In stating this proposition, the court emphasizes that it makes no comment as to whether Plaintiffs are likely or unlikely to 
prevail. As dictated by Rule 23 and the Supreme Court, that question will be considered at the proper time pursuant to the 
proper motion. "
1014,4," The court in In re Catfish Antitrust Litig., 826 F. Supp. 1019, 1036-37 (N.D. Miss. 1993), cites a number of antitrust cases in 
which typicality was satisfied where the claims were based on the same legal theory. See  In re Domestic Air Transp., 137 
F.R.D. 677, 699 (N.D. Ga. 1991) (finding that plaintiffs' claims stemmed from the same legal theory as class claims, 
notwithstanding that class members purchased tickets at different prices under varying conditions); In re Wirebound Boxes 
Antitrust Litig., 128 F.R.D. 268, 270 (D. Minn. 1989) (finding that claims were sufficiently typical of entire class where 
representatives had to prove existence, scope, and impact of an alleged nationwide conspiracy); United Nat'l Records, Inc. v. 
MCA, Inc., 99 F.R.D. 178, 181 (N.D. Ill. 1983) (finding that, while product diversity might affect the amount of recovery, it did not 
negate typicality because all class members shared the same claim arising from an alleged conspiracy); Minnesota v. United 
States Steel Corp., 44 F.R.D. 559, 566 (D. Minn. 1968) (holding that claims of representatives were typical since proof of 
conspiracy and price fixing were common to all, despite the existence of diverse methods of procuring and producing fabricated 
steel). "
1015,5," While Defendants now contend that Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977), is not 
controlling on the issue of whether growers have a claim for reduced quota, they earlier stated that ""class members who do not 
own quota obviously suffer no direct impact from any quota reduction."" (Joint Mem. Opp'n Mot. Certify at 27.) The Illinois Brick 
rule does not allow a plaintiff who buys a product from a retailer to sue the original supplier for price-fixing. Though Defendants 
argue that growers are not in the same position as the buyer, growers only suffer losses from reduced quota via their lease 
agreements with quota holders, who suffer the direct loss. "
1016,6, Neither Rule 23(b)(1) nor (b)(2) are applicable under the facts of this case.
1016,7," Windham I was reversed by a panel of the Fourth Circuit in Windham v. American Brands, Inc., 539 F.2d 1016 (4th Cir. 1976), 
which held that the district court abused its discretion in denying class certification. The Fourth Circuit, meeting en banc, then 
affirmed the district court in Windham v. American Brands, Inc., 565 F.2d 59 (1977) (Windham III). "
1017,8," Defendants also argue that the Fourth Circuit's very recent decision in Lienhart v. Dryvit Sys., Inc., 255 F.3d 138 (4th Cir. 
2001), reflects the Fourth Circuit's continued reliance on Windham III. However, the Fourth Circuit in Lienhart vacated the district 
court's class certification because the defense of contributory negligence necessarily required individualized consideration of 
impact. While the Fourth Circuit did cite Windham III, it was for the proposition that the need for individualized proof of damages 
may defeat predominance where proof of damages is essential to liability, a principle considered by this court and found to be in 
keeping with class certification in this case. See  id. at 149. Proof of damages, in other words, impact - was not susceptible to 
common proof not because of the industry, but because there was no way to mathematically determine whether individual 
contractors properly used the product. In the present case, on the other hand, the only variable the court is dealing with is price - 
if a conspiracy is shown to have reduced all prices, then there is no need to look at each individual sale because grade 
variations and other localized conditions were already factored into the original price. "
1018,9," Plaintiffs state that the counsel page of the amended complaint read ""E.N. Ziegler, Drawer 150, Florence, SC 29501."" (Rev'd 
Mem. Supp. Mot. Certify at 40.) "
1019,10," Defendants also contend that Plaintiffs cannot prove the allegation of product allocation without individualized consideration of 
the role played by warehousemen and auctioneers. However, their role is not relevant to the question of whether Defendants 
conspired to allocate the tobacco supply."
1019,11," Plaintiffs have presented ample evidence, under seal, of Defendants' actions in support of class certification. The court should 
not engage in a determination of the credibility of the proposed evidence because that is a matter for the trier of fact. "
1020,12," See also  In re Industrial Diamonds Antitrust Litig., 167 F.R.D. 374, 377 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (finding that proof of classwide impact 
was possible, despite the fact that the defendant offered more than 8000 distinct industrial diamond products, and individual 
customers negotiated a variety of discounts, rebates, credits, or special service arrangements); In re NASDAQ Market-Makers 
Antitrust Litig., 169 F.R.D. 493, 509 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (finding that Rule 23(b)(3) was satisfied where plaintiffs alleged antitrust 
conspiracy concerning thousands of sales of securities to ""at least a million members""); In re Playmobil Antitrust Litig., 35 F. 
Supp. 2d 231, 238 (E.D.N.Y. 1998) (allowing certification where defendant argued that proof of alleged conspiracy required the 
individual examination of defendant's interaction with approximately 1400 retailers); In re Flat Glass Antitrust Litig., 191 F.R.D. 
472, 484-85 (W.D. Pa. 1999) (rejecting defendants' contention that diverse products, markets, and pricing would prevent proof of 
an overarching conspiracy); In re: Magnetic Audiotape Antitrust Litig., 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7303, 99 Civ. 1580 (S.D.N.Y. June 
1, 2001), at *20 (finding common impact though defendants argued that there were significant differences between purchasers, 
and contract terms and prices varied). "
1021,13," The court need not discuss the background of Defendants' expert, Dr. Scheffman (Scheffman), at this time. It is Plaintiffs' 
burden to show that they will introduce valid methods of proving classwide impact and damages. It is not necessary for the court 
to determine whether Defendants' expert has shown valid methods of proof, as well. As discussed below, the court will not 
choose a winner in the battle of the experts. "
1022,14," The Fourth Circuit in Windham III noted that, while the USDA used 161 grades to classify flue-cured tobacco, the buyer 
defendants only used 10 to 32 classifications. See 565 F.2d at 62-63. Scheffman's report states that the USDA currently uses 
112 grades for burley tobacco and 152 grades for flue-cured tobacco. However, documents under seal indicate that at least one 
Defendant Manufacturer only uses approximately nine grades. "
1023,15," With regard to Defendants' argument that Plaintiffs cannot recover under these claims for damages because they were the 
result of state action, the court found in its July 24, 2001, memorandum opinion that neither claim was barred. "
1036,1," The Republic Value-Added Rebate Incentive Program (""VRIP"") provides incentives to distributors for stocking, promoting, and 
selling Republic's products to their retail accounts. (Second Amended Complaint, P 12.) The Republic Convenience Store 
Distribution Incentive Program (""CDIP"") provides incentives to convenience stores for stocking and selling Republic's products. 
(Id. P 13.) The Republic Travel Plus Program, open to both distributors and convenience stores, offers ""points"" to be used 
toward trips, such as cruises. (Id. P 14 & Exs. C, D.)"
1036,2, Most of the display boxes are off-white; some are blue. 
1037,3," The Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13(a)-(f), prohibits certain price discrimination by a seller among its customers."
1037,4," The Second Amended Complaint also alleges that Jay Martin, North Atlantic's representative, told representatives of five 
nationwide tobacco-product distributors (who were also Republic's customers) that Republic's programs were illegal. This 
statement purportedly occurred at a meeting in Chicago in late July 1998. Republic now acknowledges that these allegations 
were made upon information and belief and based on hearsay statements, and concedes that there is no evidence that Martin 
described Republic's programs as being ""illegal."" (Republic Response at 3 n.3.) Because Republic cannot demonstrate a 
genuine issue of fact as to this allegation, we will not consider it as a basis for any of its claims."
1037,5," North Atlantic originally alleged that the ""Southeast"" consisted of ten states--Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, 
North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. (Counterclaim, P 3.) "
1039,6," Because we instructed the parties that it was not necessary to file Local Rule 56.1 statements of material fact, it was even more 
incumbent upon the parties to cite to specific evidence in the record to support the arguments in their briefs. Rather than 
providing us with clear arguments and clear citations to supporting law and evidence, both parties have muddied the waters in 
several instances as to what is at issue in these motions--e.g., whether they agree on applicable law, whether certain facts are 
undisputed, whether those facts are material, etc. To put it another way, the briefs are simply not ""user-friendly."" North Atlantic's 
briefs, especially, fail to cite to supporting evidence for many of the arguments contained therein."
1039,7," Furthermore, North Atlantic did not bring a counterclaim for trademark infringement. "
1041,8," Because we find that Republic has failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact with respect to these elements of its 
claim, we need not address the issue of whether North Atlantic's actions were protected by the ""competitor's privilege."""
1041,9," On this issue, Republic submits the affidavit of Warren Schoening, its National Sales Manager. Schoening states that ""because 
Clark had no other reason for canceling the [exclusivity] contract, I concluded that its cancellation was based on North Atlantic's 
conduct."" (Republic App. II, Vol. I, Schoening Aff. P 15). However, such conclusory and self-serving statements in an affidavit 
without support in the record cannot create a triable issue of fact. See  Hall v. Bodine Elec. Co., 276 F.3d 345, 354 (7th Cir. 
2002)."
1041,10," Apparently, Republic has abandoned its contention that North Atlantic interfered with Republic's relationship with a company 
called Garber Brothers, Inc. (as alleged in the Second Amended Complaint)."
1041,11," Although Republic states that it moves for summary judgment on Count V, Republic presents no argument or supporting 
evidence for granting it summary judgment on this claim. Its motion is therefore denied as to Count V. "
1042,12," In William H. Morris Co. v. Group W, Inc., 66 F.3d 255 (9th Cir. 1995), the counter-plaintiff sought damages. The court held 
that the counter-plaintiff failed to establish that the statement at issue actually deceived a significant number of consumers. This 
was ""not necessarily fatal"" to its case, though, because if the counter-defendant had intentionally misled consumers, then the 
court would presume deception. The case was remanded for a finding as to whether counter-defendant acted with the intent to 
deceive. In H.W. Carter & Sons, Inc. v. William Carter Co., 913 F. Supp. 796, 805 (S.D.N.Y. 1996), the court held that the 
misleading aspects of the letter at issue were not material. In Black & Decker (U.S.) Inc. v. Pro-Tech Power Inc., 26 F. Supp. 2d 
834 (E.D. Va. 1998), the plaintiff's Lanham Act claim failed because the allegedly misleading letter did not contain any 
misrepresentations, as the claims described therein were meritorious."
1042,13," While judgment as a matter of law on a portion of a single claim is not an option under the Federal Rules, a district court may, 
pursuant to Rule 56(d), issue an order ""specifying the facts that appear without substantial controversy, including the extent to 
which the amount of damages or other relief is not in controversy."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d); see also  Occidental Fire & Cas. Co. v. 
Continental Bank N.A., 918 F.2d 1312, 1320 (7th Cir. 1990) (noting that under Rule 56(d) the trial court may enter a binding 
order ""listing the facts that are not in dispute""); U.S. ex rel. Ramm Plumbing Co. v. Wil-Freds Constr., Inc., 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS

labeled ""partial summary judgment,"" it is actually interlocutory in nature.  Capitol Records, Inc. v. Progress Record Distrib., Inc., "
1043,106," F.R.D. 25, 29 (N.D. Ill. 1985); see also  EEOC v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 839 F.2d 302, 353 n.53 (7th Cir. 1988) (noting that 
""the phrase 'partial summary judgment' is typically a misnomer used to describe a pretrial order under [Rule] 56(d)"" because 
such an order ""is definitely interlocutory and nonappealable""). The purpose of this procedure is twofold: to salvage some of the 
judicial effort involved in the denial of a motion for summary judgment and to streamline the litigation process by narrowing the 
triable issues. Lovejoy Elects., Inc. v. O'Berto, 616 F. Supp. 1464, 1473 (N.D. Ill. 1985) (citing, inter alia,  Yale Transp. Corp. v. 
Yellow Truck & Coach Mfg., 3 F.R.D. 440, 441 (S.D.N.Y. 1944))."
1043,14," We realize that this construction of the statute may disregard the word ""business"" in the phrase ""disparages the goods, 
services, or business of another."" However, we must follow the Illinois courts' interpretation of Illinois law."
1043,15," Because we are granting summary judgment on this ground, we need not address North Atlantic's alternative arguments that 
summary judgment is appropriate because (1) the letters said nothing false or misleading; and (2) the only relief available under 
the UDTPA is injunctive relief, and the conduct at issue has ceased with no threat of future harm. "
1044,16," Contrary to North Atlantic's suggestion, HN15[
] the standard of proof for defamation per se is no different for corporations 
than for individual plaintiffs. See  Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Jacobson, 713 F.2d 262, 269 (7th Cir. 1983). Obviously, 
though, the second and fifth categories of defamation per se could not apply to a corporation. "
1047,17," It is important to note that Count II alleges false advertising, not false designation of origin. "
1049,18," Each of these claims should have been alleged in a separate count. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 10(b) states, in pertinent 
part, that ""HN26[
] each claim founded upon a separate transaction or occurrence . . . shall be stated in a separate count . . . 
whenever a separation facilitates the clear presentation of the matters set forth."" In keeping with the rule, the courts have 
required a separate count for each distinctive statutory, constitutional, or common law claim. See Casler v. Janus, 1998 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 3989, No. 97 C 5049, 1998 WL 151811, at *1 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 26, 1998) (citing cases). There are two purposes for 
requiring separate counts: (1) to give fair notice to the defendants of the claims against them; and (2) to enable the court to grant 
relief on an entire count, not just part of a count. See 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3989. "
1050,19," As an example of North Atlantic's evasive approach to the briefing of these motions, it fails to take an affirmative position as to 
what state's law applies. North Atlantic does not take issue with Republic's application of Illinois law, but cites to Kentucky law 
(without explanation) for the definition of conversion. North Atlantic adds a footnote citing to Tennessee, Michigan, and Illinois 
law as well and states that ""even if Illinois law applies, North Atlantic's claim satisfies the additional required element: that North 
Atlantic made a demand to Republic for possession of the displays."" (North Atlantic Response at 49.) We will apply Illinois law 
because there is no real dispute that it applies, and because it appears that the conversion claim would fail under Kentucky, 
Tennessee, and Michigan law anyway. "

1063,7," It should be noted that the Bright Belt Warehouse Association, Inc., a trade association of independent tobacco warehouse 
owners to which some of the plaintiff warehouse owners belong, sent a letter to Stabilization affirming that ""Bright Belt 
Warehouse Association is not involved in any endeavor to bring a lawsuit against Stabilization and is not responsible for, or party 
to, any such litigious action brought forth by any individual warehouse member."" Letter from Terry C. Campbell, Managing 
Director, Bright Belt Warehouse Association, Inc. to Lionel Edwards, General Manager, Flue-Cured Tobacco Cooperative 
Stabilization Corporation (March 11, 2002) (submitted to the court with defendants' supporting materials). "
1065,1," Unless otherwise indicated, all further statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code. Section 17200 et seq. 
are generally referred to as the unfair competition law, and we will use that terminology. ( Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. v. Lucky 
Stores, Inc. (1998) 17 Cal.4th 553, 558, fn. 2, 950 P.2d 1086.) "
1066,2," Defendants objected to a court trial on grounds that plaintiffs were limiting their action in order to avoid a jury trial on the 
issues. The objection was overruled on grounds that the unfair competition cause of action sought equitable remedies, and that 
no jury trial was required on that cause of action."
1066,3," We have disregarded respondent's five-page statement of facts because it fails to include any citations to the record. (See Cal. 
Rules of Court, former rule 15(a), now rule14(a): ""The statement of any matter in the record shall be supported by appropriate 
reference to the record."".)"
1066,4, Defendant Miguel Soto was an employee of plaintiff Juan Rojas.
1066,5," Although an escrow is generally required to transfer a liquor license ( § 24074), an escrow is not required for the transfer of a 
license by a receiver ( § 24075). "
1067,6," Mr. Rojas identified himself on the record as Ron Rojas. Since he testified that the signature of Juan Rojas on exhibit 1 was his 
signature, we conclude that Ron Rojas and Juan Rojas are the same person."
1067,7," The agreement states that it is subject to the liquor license being transferred to the payee. This was apparently an error 
because Miguel Soto, the payor, was buying the business. Mr. Valdez understood that Miguel Soto was the payee."
1067,8," A fictitious business name certificate dated August 26, 1997 states that El Rancho Bar & Grill Restaurant was owned by a 
partnership, and that Juan Rojas and Jorge Rojas were the general partners. The certificate is signed by Jorge Rojas."
1067,9," Juan Rojas also testified that he had met Mr. Valdez in December 1996 and had given him $ 10,000 in cash to purchase the 
liquor license. Subsequently, he gave Mr. Soto and Mr. Valdez a number of other checks, allegedly as payment for the liquor "
1068,," license. Juan Rojas sought restitution in the sum of $ 34,859.03. In closing argument, plaintiffs' counsel indicated he was 
seeking restitution of $ 10,000, and the court ordered restitution in that amount."
1068,10," Miguel Soto testified that the power of attorney meant that he would transfer the liquor license as soon as Juan Rojas paid the 
note. The power of attorney contains no such limitation."
1068,11," Jorge Rojas testified that property valued at $ 50,703.62 was taken, that the property taken was not subject to the financing 
statement, and the restaurant was ""destroyed"" in the process."
1068,12," This was apparently an accurate statement, as Mr. Soto renewed the license on July 22, 1998, using a check from Mr. Valdez 
to do so. However, Jorge Rojas testified that the restaurant ceased operations in April 1998 because the license was recalled by 
Mr. Soto."
1068,13," The present action was filed on October 20, 1998. As discussed below, this action is limited to the liquor license, and we 
express no opinion on the merits of the other action. "
1069,14," Juan Rojas testified that the business opportunity was brought to him by his employee, Miguel Soto. He further testified that 
Miguel Soto and Jorge Soto began operating the bar in January 1997, and that Miguel Soto brought his brother Jorge Soto into 
the business because Jorge Soto was unemployed."
1069,15," Although injunctions under the unfair competition law are normally prohibitory, plaintiffs do not contend that the injunction was 
improper because it was mandatory. "
1070,16," Respondents contend that Mr. Soto's liability may ""be predicated on the principles in People v. Witzerman (1972) 29 Cal. App. 
3d 169, 105 Cal. Rptr. 284."" In that case, the Attorney General brought a false advertising case and appellants were enjoined 
from selling certain cattle care contracts which constituted securities under the corporate securities law. The defendants all 
worked together in the sale of the contracts, and the case does not support the theory that Mr. Soto was liable because he acted 
as a ""middleman"" between Mr. Valdez and Juan Rojas. Respondents also suggest that a conspiracy theory would be an appropriate basis for holding Mr. Soto liable, citing People v. 
Bestline Products, Inc. (1976) 61 Cal. App. 3d 879, 918, 132 Cal. Rptr. 767. But there was no evidence that Mr. Soto conspired 
with Mr. Valdez to defraud Juan Rojas. The only evidence was that they each acted to protect their own interests in arms length 
transactions. "
1081,1," The BPA markets power from federal and nonfederal hydroelectric projects, with a primary service area that includes California, 
Oregon, and Nevada. The BPA's transmission lines constitute approximately 80 percent of the Pacific Northwest's bulk 
transmission capacity. "
1082,2," The Pacific AC Intertie is located south of the California-Oregon border and is owned by utilities not parties to this litigation. It 
was already connected to the Northwest AC Intertie, but that connection provided only 3200 MW of transfer capability. "
1083,3," After the district court filed its opinion in this case, an administrative law judge released a decision in the ongoing FERC 
proceeding that is reported at Sierra Pacific Power Co., 94 F.E.R.C. 63,019 (2001). Although that decision is still subject to 
further administrative and judicial review, and therefore not finally dispositive of any issue in the case, the existence of the 
ongoing litigation within FERC is an adjudicative fact relevant to this case. Federal Rules of Evidence 201(a), (b). Further, the 
existence of the opinion is not in dispute, nor are its contents. Id. Therefore, we take judicial notice of the entirety of 94 F.E.R.C. 
63,019. See Fed. R. Evid. 201(c). This renders moot the parties' pending motions requesting that we take judicial notice of only 
select portions of that decision. "
1084,4," We assume, without deciding, that a deprivation of electricity might support a claim for inverse condemnation under California 
law.  Cf.  Harding v. State of Cal. ex rel. Dept. of Transp., 159 Cal. App. 3d 359, 364-67, 205 Cal. Rptr. 561 (1984) (holding that 
a deprivation of light can support an inverse condemnation claim). "
1085,5," The parties devote much discussion to the administrative record component of the Public Utility District Number 1 decision, as 
opposed to our holding that the oral contract claim was not a challenge to any final administrative decision. This is a plausible 
reading of Public Utility District Number 1, but not an accurate one. The key test under section 9(e)(5) is whether there is a 
challenge to a final administrative decision or its implementation, not the existence or adequacy of an administrative record. See  
Cent. Mont. Elec. Power, 840 F.2d at 1476; see also  Puget Sound Energy, Inc. v. United States, 47 Fed. Cl. 506, 512 (Claims 
Ct. 2000). This is especially true where, as here, the asserted inadequacy of an administrative record regarding a key issue was 
caused by the plaintiff's failure to raise that issue in response to an administrative decision that clearly implicated the issue."
1085,6," Alternatively, TANC asks us to transfer this case to the Court of Federal Claims. Although it is true that court has jurisdiction 
over non-tort suits against the BPA, see 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(a)(2), 1491, that jurisdiction only exists where we lack exclusive 
jurisdiction under section 9(e)(5).  Public Utility District Number 1, 855 F.2d at 650. "
1086,7," Decisions under the Natural Gas Act and Federal Power Act are interchangeable. See  Arkansas Louisiana Gas Co. v. Hall, 
453 U.S. 571, 577 n.7, 69 L. Ed. 2d 856, 101 S. Ct. 2925 (1981). "
1088,8," In a case deciding several consolidated appeals, the D.C. Circuit upheld FERC Order No. 888; the Supreme Court granted 
certiorari on two issues not related to this appeal and issued an opinion affirming the D.C. Circuit and upholding FERC Order No. 
888.  Transmission Access Policy Study Group v. FERC, 343 U.S. App. D.C. 151, 225 F.3d 667 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (per curiam), 
aff'd sub. nom.  New York v. FERC, 535 U.S. 1, 152 L. Ed. 2d 47, 122 S. Ct. 1012, 2002 U.S. LEXIS 1380 (March 4, 2002)."
1088,9," We have grounded our decision in the filed rate doctrine, despite the existence of separate FERC authority over transmission 
capacity, because no court has yet determined whether the rule against courts assuming hypothetical allocations of transmission 
capacity would apply if the hypothetical allocations of transmission capacity did not affect FERC-controlled rates. We note, 
however, that as the Supreme Court has recently explained, HN18[
] FERC's jurisdiction of electricity transmission, unlike its 
jurisdiction over sales (i.e. rates), can reach intrastate transmissions. New York v. FERC, 535 U.S. 1, 152 L. Ed. 2d 47, 2002 
U.S. LEXIS 1380, 122 S. Ct. 1012 at 1027. Hence, we reserve for future resolution the question whether federal law preempts 
claims that assume a hypothetical allocation of intrastate transmission capacity, notwithstanding FERC's lack of authority over 
intrastate sales. "
1089,10," If TANC's fraud claim were predicated on alleged misrepresentations before FERC, it would still be preempted based upon the 
reasoning that we apply infra to a claim alleging misrepresentations to the California PUC. We note that such a claim might also 
be preempted under Buckman v. Plaintiffs' Legal Commission, 531 U.S. 341, 343-44, 148 L. Ed. 2d 854, 121 S. Ct. 1012 (2001) 
(holding that HN19[
] a state law fraud-on-the-Food and Drug Administration (FDA) claim is impliedly preempted by statutory 
scheme granting FDA power to punish and deter fraud), and Nathan Kimmel, Inc. v. DowElanco, 275 F.3d 1199, 1204-07 (9th 
Cir. 2002) (holding that a state law claim that hinged upon the theory that the defendant made misrepresentations to the 
Environmental Protection Agency was preempted by a statutory scheme similar to that at issue in Buckman), but we need not 
decide that issue. "
1090,11," We note that the HN22[
] California law does not recognize a state law equivalent of the filed rate doctrine. See Knevelbaard Dairies v. Kraft Foods, Inc., 232 F.3d 979, 992-93 (9th Cir. 2000) (citing Cellular Plus, Inc., v. Super. Ct., 14 Cal. 
App. 4th 1224, 18 Cal. Rptr. 2d 308 (1993)). Our decision, thus, is entirely based upon the effect of an award of damages on 
FERC's authority over interstate rates. "
1099,1," The plaintiff presented the following three issues on appeal: ""(1) Whether the trial court erred in holding that Illinois Brick Co. v. 
Illinois, 431 U.S. 720 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977), bars an antitrust claim by a direct licensee of the product in 
question . . . ""(2) Whether the trial court erred in holding that Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, supra, 431 U.S. 720, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 
overrides the express right granted to consumers by [General Statutes] § 35-35 to bring an antitrust action . . . and ""(3) Whether the trial court erred in holding that the striking of [the] plaintiff's antitrust claim also required the striking of [the] 
plaintiff's claims brought pursuant to the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act [CUTPA], [General Statutes] § 42-110a et seq."" At oral argument, the plaintiff further narrowed the statement of the issues as follows: ""First, whether [the plaintiff] can bring a 
claim under the Connecticut Antitrust Act [General Statutes § 35-24 et seq.] and, second, even if that claim is barred, whether 
[the plaintiff] can still bring his claims under [CUTPA]."""
1099,2," Although Vacco purportedly brought this action as a class action on behalf of himself and other similarly situated end user 
licensees of the defendant's software product who reside in Connecticut, there is no indication that the trial court certified the 
plaintiff's action as a class action. We, therefore, refer to Vacco as the plaintiff."
1099,3," HN1[
] An ""end user"" refers to the ""ultimate consumer of a finished product."" Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (10th 
Ed. 1997) p. 383. In the context of this case, the term refers to a customer who has purchased from a vendor or retailer a 
computer system that includes preloaded software. See M. Lemley et al., Software and Internet Law (2000) p. 1092. "
1100,4," The retail store is one in a chain of stores known as ""Staples."" Staples is neither a party to this action nor is it affiliated with the 
defendant."
1100,5," An ""Intel-based personal computer"" is a computer designed to function with a microprocessor manufactured by the Intel 
Corporation or with a compatible microprocessor manufactured by another firm. According to the complaint, Intel-based personal 
computers are the most widely used and sold computers in the United States and Connecticut. Intel Corporation is not a party to 
the present action."
1100,6," ""Windows 98"" is a computer software program that functions as a computer operating system. The plaintiff defines ""computer 
operating system"" in his complaint as ""a software program that controls the allocation and use of computer resources, such as 
central processing unit time, main memory space, disk space, and input and output channels. . . . The operating system also 
supports the functions of other software programs, called 'applications,' that perform particular tasks for the [personal computer] 
user, such as word processing, [spreadsheet] design and use, and database management."""
1100,7," It is important to note that the use of end user license agreements is standard practice in the software distribution market. See, 
e.g., R. Schechter, ""The Unfairness of Click-On Software Licenses,"" 46 Wayne L. Rev. 1735, 1736 (2000); see also W. 
Tanenbaum, ""Current Topics in Software Licensing,"" in Practising Law Institute Series No. G-620: Understanding the Intellectual 
Property License (2000) p. 100 (discussing rise of end user licenses in software distribution market). Often called ""mass-market 
licenses,"" ""click wrap licenses"" or ""shrink-wrap licenses,"" these licenses require an end user to accept various terms as a 
precondition to downloading or using the specified software program. See, e.g., C. McManis, ""The Privatization (or 'Shrink-
Wrapping') of American Copyright Law,"" 87 Cal. L. Rev. 173, 174-75 (1999). ""In placing a shrink-wrap license provision on its 
software product, the producer seeks to 1) prohibit unauthorized copies; 2) prohibit software rental; 3) prohibit reverse 
engineering and modifications to the software; 4) limit the use of the software to one central processing unit; 5) disclaim 
warranties; and 6) limit liability."" J. Rolling, ""The UCC Under Wraps: Exposing the Need for More Notice to Consumers of 
Computer Software with Shrinkwrapped Licenses,"" 104 Com. L.J. 197, 210-11 n.76 (1999)."
1100,8," As the trial court noted, this case is one of many state antitrust actions that has been instituted following the decision in United 
States v. Microsoft Corp., 84 F. Supp. 2d 9 (D.D.C. 1999) (findings of fact), and United States v. Microsoft Corp., 87 F. Supp. 2d 
30, 35 (D.D.C. 2000) (conclusions of law), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 253 F.3d 34 (D.C. Cir. 2001), in which the United States 
District Court for the District of Columbia held, inter alia, that the defendant had maintained a monopoly in the Intel compatible 
personal computer operating system market."
1100,9," The plaintiff's complaint contained three counts. In count one, the plaintiff alleged a violation of the Antitrust Act. Counts two 
and three, which were based on the same material factual allegations contained in the first count, set forth the plaintiff's CUTPA 
claims. "
1101,10," The state office of the attorney general was granted permission to file an amicus curiae brief in this appeal. Thereafter, the 
Connecticut Business and Industry Association, the Association for Competitive Technology and the New England Legal 
Foundation were granted permission to file a joint amicus curiae brief."
1101,11," General Statutes § 35-35 provides in relevant part: HN2[
] ""The state, or any person, including, but not limited to, a 
consumer, injured in its business or property by any violation of the provisions of . . . chapter [624] shall recover treble damages, 
together with a reasonable attorney's fee and costs."""
1101,12," We note that the office of the attorney general, as amicus curiae, has adopted fully the plaintiff's arguments with respect to the 
plaintiff's antitrust claim. "
1103,13," To prove successfully that the antitrust defendant's conduct caused the plaintiff's injuries under the offensive use of the pass 
on theory, the plaintiff must proffer evidence showing how each economic actor between the defendant and the plaintiff in the 
chain of distribution had passed on the defendant's overcharge, either wholly or in part, to the next actor in the chain, ultimately 
ending with the plaintiff. See J. Cirace, ""Apportioning Damages Between Direct and Indirect Purchasers in Consolidated Antitrust 
Suits: ARC America Unravels the Illinois Brick Rule,"" 35 Vill. L. Rev. 283, 311-16 (1990) (discussing pass on theory). See 
generally W. Page, ""The Limits of State Indirect Purchaser Suits: Class Certification in the Shadow of Illinois Brick,"" 67 Antitrust 
L.J. 1 (1999) (discussing pass on theory in context of class action suits)."
1103,14," Notwithstanding the United States Supreme Court's concerns regarding the offensive use of the pass on theory, the court has 
recognized, at least in dictum, two narrow exceptions to the direct purchaser rule: when the direct purchaser and the indirect 
purchaser have entered into a cost-plus contract; Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, supra, 431 U.S. at 732 n.12, 736; Hanover Shoe, 
Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., supra, 392 U.S. at 494; and when the indirect purchaser wholly owns and controls the 
direct purchaser. Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, supra, at 736 n.16. In the cost-plus contract situation, the use of the pass on theory 
is unnecessary because ""the effect of the overcharge is essentially determined in advance, without reference to the interaction of 
supply and demand that complicates the determination in the general case."" Id., at 736. Similarly, when the indirect purchaser 
owns and controls the direct purchaser, the two are one and the same, making any apportionment of damages irrelevant. We 
note that neither of these exceptions is relevant to the present appeal. "
1104,15," Compare § 35-35 with § 4 of the Clayton Act, as amended, which provides in relevant part that ""any person who shall be 
injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of 
the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without respect to the amount in 
controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's 
fee. . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 15 (a) (2000)."
1104,16," In support of Public Acts 1992, No. 92-248, of which § 2 is codified at General Statutes § 35-44b, Representative Thomas G. 
Moukawsher, a sponsor of the bill, stated: ""Antitrust laws originally were enacted at a time when American and Connecticut 
corporations were, in many ways, [too] dominant nationwide . . . and internationally, to provide fair competition . . . within the 
United States and without the United States. Today, some of the problems have changed, in terms of international competition . . 
. and we're trying to do some things to make changes to keep up with the times. . . ."
1104,*," * * ""The second part of the bill would mirror what Connecticut has done with unfair trade practices. Under [CUTPA], a Connecticut 
[court] looks to federal Unfair Trade Practices Act . . . jurisprudence. This would attempt to do the same thing with antitrust law . 
. . the goal being to have a single antitrust jurisprudence in the United States. This is vital if corporations are going to be able to 
make critical decisions about research and development projects . . . that they may undertake . . . as well as corporate ventures 
in general, where antitrust laws may pose an obstacle. This would allow them to look to a single case law jurisprudence . . . in 
order to know whether they're in compliance with our laws . . . . Currently, a corporation in Connecticut or elsewhere . . . may 
have to look to [fifty] different sets of jurisprudence. This would move towards a national jurisprudence, and I believe it will 
strongly enhance the international competitiveness of Connecticut, and of American manufacturing and research companies, 
wherever they may be."" 35 H.R. Proc., Pt. 7, 1992 Sess., pp. 2386-87. "
1105,17," It is important to note the procedural posture pursuant to which the United States Supreme Court entertained the appeal in 
Reiter and the fact that the court did not address whether the direct purchaser rule of Illinois Brick had barred the plaintiff's 
claims. See Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., supra, 442 U.S. at 337 n.3. First, the court had granted certiorari on the issue of whether a 
consumer alleging noncommercial injuries may recover under § 4 of the Clayton Act, which arose from an interlocutory order 
that the District Court had certified to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.  Id., at 334-36. Second, the court explained in a 
footnote that the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals expressly had declined to address whether the plaintiff's claim for treble 
damages was barred by the direct purchaser rule and, therefore, that issue was not before the United States Supreme Court on 
appeal.  Id., at 337 n.3; see also footnote 19 of this opinion."
1105,18," The plaintiff in Reiter brought a class action on behalf of herself and other retail purchasers of hearing aids.  Reiter v. 
Sonotone Corp., supra, 442 U.S. at 335."
1105,19," In so deciding, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals declined to address whether the direct purchaser rule of Illinois Brick had 
barred the plaintiff's claims, noting that ""[the plaintiff] did not purchase [the] hearing aids directly from the manufacturers. In 
Illinois Brick . . . the [United States] Supreme Court held that only direct purchasers may sue for treble damages under § 4 of the 
Clayton Act. The court recognized, however, that indirect purchasers may maintain actions involving cost-plus contracts as well 
as those in which market forces have been superseded [as when] the direct purchaser is owned or controlled by its customer. . . 
. ""[The plaintiff] contends that the manufacturers in [Reiter] engaged in various prohibited vertical restraints including resale price 
maintenance. In view of [the court's] holding that ordinary consumers may not maintain treble damage actions, we need not 
decide whether [the manufacturers'] alleged violations constitute an exception to Illinois Brick."" (Citations omitted; internal 
quotation marks omitted.) Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 579 F.2d 1077, at 1079 n.3 (8th Cir. 1978). "
1106,20," The plaintiff relies on Hyde v. Abbott Laboratories, Inc., 123 N.C. App. 572, 473 S.E.2d 680, review denied, 344 N.C. 734, 478 
S.E.2d 5 (1996), and Blake v. Abbott Laboratories, Inc., 1996 Tenn. App. LEXIS 184, No. 03 A01-9509-CV-00307, 1996 WL 
134947 (Tenn. App. 1996), for the proposition that appellate case law from other jurisdictions supports his right to sue. Such 
reliance is misplaced, however, since HN20[
] neither North Carolina nor Tennessee statutorily require their state courts to 
follow federal court interpretations of federal antitrust statutes in construing their respective state statutes. See generally §§ N.C. 
Gen. Stat. 75-1 through 75-35 (1999);§§ Tenn. Code Ann. 47-25-101 through 47-25-112 (2001)."
1106,21," Although we agree with the plaintiff that Illinois Brick was decided after passage of the Antitrust Act, and, thus, presumably, 
an indirect purchaser could have sued under federal and state antitrust law before the date of that decision, the legislative 
history of the Antitrust Act clearly demonstrates the legislature's intent that the Antitrust Act be interpreted in accordance with the 
federal courts' interpretation of federal antitrust law. Moreover, this legislative intent is codified at § 35-44b. HN21[
] We, 
therefore, reject the plaintiff's contention that the Antitrust Act should be interpreted in accordance with the state of federal 
antitrust law existing at the time that the Antitrust Act was passed. "
1107,22," These bills are so-called because their purpose is to nullify at the state level the United States Supreme Court's holding in 
Illinois Brick."
1107,23," On May 24, 1983, Raised Committee Bill No. 1119 was defeated in the Senate by a vote of twenty to fourteen. 26 S. Proc., Pt. 
10, 1983 Sess., pp. 3300-3301. Before the vote had been taken, however, Sentator Howard T. Owens, Jr., one of the bill's 
sponsors, explained the purpose of the bill as follows: ""We develop [antitrust] laws so that the consumer in the state can, in fact, 
be protected. However, part of the problem that we have with this is a case that came down from the United States Supreme 
Court back in 1977 called [Illinois Brick]. That case in effect said that purchasers who do not buy directly from the [antitrust] 
violator or violators are denied recovery under the federal [antitrust] law . . . . ""They are saying that the only ones who have the right to bring suits under the [antitrust] laws are those who have been directly 
affected or have had lost directly from the [antitrust] violator. . . . This bill would give indirect purchasers a remedy under the 
state's [antitrust] law and would allow the [antitrust] violator if in fact [he has] committed a violation, a defense that the plaintiff 
purchaser passed on all or part of the claimed overcharge or underpayment to another purchaser or seller."
1107,*," * * ""This bill would allow the attorney general or individuals who had been affected even though they were not the direct purchasers, 
to bring suit and to recover damages if need be."" 26 S. Proc., Pt. 10, 1983 Sess., pp. 3298-99. "
1108,24," We note that the position of the office of the attorney general, as set forth in its May 2, 2001 amicus curiae brief submitted to 
this court, regarding the applicability of Illinois Brick to the Antitrust Act is inconsistent with the position that it had taken before 
the judiciary committee in March, 2001. See Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 6, 2001 Sess., p. 1988. In its amicus curiae brief, the office of the attorney general adopts the plaintiff's argument that the Antitrust Act does not embrace 
the direct purchaser rule of Illinois Brick. In written testimony submitted to the judiciary committee in support of Senate Bill No. 
1262, 2001 Sess., however, Attorney General Blumenthal explained: ""Generally, if someone violates a law and injures another 
person, that violator is liable for damages. A frequent, unfortunate exception concerns the antitrust laws. Under Connecticut law, 
a consumer, a business, even the state, cannot recover for the harm caused by a violator of our antitrust laws unless the 
consumer, business or the state purchased a product or service directly from the violator. ""In antitrust cases, when competing manufacturers conspire to fix prices, a middleman purchases the goods at a higher price 
and passes that higher price onto the consumer. The consumer is ultimately harmed but cannot recover from the manufacturer. 
Only the middleman can recover damages but the middleman has passed along the higher costs to the consumer and has 
suffered little, if any, harm. Thus, this anomaly in the law harms anyone who is an indirect purchaser, including retailers, to small 
businesses, union health plans, and ordinary consumers. ""Senate Bill 1262 simply provides that any person who is harmed by the actions of an antitrust violator may recover damages 
from the violator of our laws. . . . This type of legislation has been passed in [twenty-one] states . . . . ""In stark contrast, the state of Connecticut and Connecticut businesses and consumers have been denied the ability to recover 
millions of dollars in damages from antitrust violations because we have not passed Senate Bill 1262, allowing indirect 
purchasers to sue for damages."" (Emphasis in original.) Id. "
1109,25," Original computer equipment manufacturers generally sell computers consisting of bundled software and hardware 
components from different manufacturers to retailers and end users. See, e.g., M. Lemley et al., Software and Internet Law 
(2000) p. 1096."
1109,26," It is important to note that, under the end user license agreement for the defendant's computer operating systems, the plaintiff 
is not only recognized as a licensee of both the defendant and the manufacturer of his computer system, but also as an indirect 
purchaser of Windows 98. Accordingly, the end user license agreement provides in relevant part: ""This End-User License

may not use or copy the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, and you should promptly contact Manufacturer for instructions on return of the 
unused product(s) for a refund. . . ."" The end user license agreement for the defendant's computer software similarly provides in relevant part: ""This Microsoft End-
User License Agreement ('EULA') is a legal agreement between you . . . and Microsoft Corporation for the Microsoft software 
product identified above . . . . By installing, copying, downloading, accessing or otherwise using the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, 
you agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA. If you do not agree to the terms of this EULA, do not install or use the

1110,27," General Statutes § 42-110b provides in relevant part: HN25[
] ""(a) No person shall engage in unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce. . . ."""
1110,28," General Statutes § 42-110g provides in relevant part: HN26[
] ""(a) Any person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment of a method, act or practice prohibited by section 42-110b, 
may bring an action in the judicial district in which the plaintiff or defendant resides or has his principal place of business or is 
doing business, to recover actual damages. Proof of public interest or public injury shall not be required in any action brought 
under this section. The court may, in its discretion, award punitive damages and may provide such equitable relief as it deems 
necessary or proper. . . ."""
1110,29," Following oral argument before this court, we ordered, sua sponte, the parties to brief the following issue: ""Does the plaintiff 
have standing to maintain his CUTPA claim in light of [this] court's decision in Ganim v. Smith & Wesson Corp., 258 Conn. 313, 
780 A.2d 98 (2001)?"" "
1111,30," Notwithstanding the failure of the plaintiff to provide any authority to support his argument, we previously have stated that ""the 
legislative history does . . . indicate that [P.A. 79-210] was intended to make privity less of an obstacle to recovery under 
CUTPA. Arnold Feigen, assistant attorney general, noted in the debates concerning [P.A. 79-210] in the legislature that: '[the 
proposed legislation] deletes references to the phrase ""such seller or lessor in the private section of [CUTPA]."" . . . The 
[proposed legislation] will now allow a suit by any person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property. Numerous 
arguments have been raised in both state and federal courts that the plaintiff, in order to sue, must be a purchaser or a lessee of 
a seller or lessor. Clarification of [§ ] 42-110g (a) is essential in order to avoid needless litigation of the particular phrase now 
found in the statute.' Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, [General Law], Pt. 4, 1979 Sess., p. 1159, remarks of Arnold 
Feigen, Assistant Attorney General, in support of Raised Committee Bill No. 7810."" Jackson v. R. G. Whipple, Inc., 225 Conn. 
705, 724-25, 627 A.2d 374 (1993)."
1111,31," In Ganim, we offered the following illustration, which is applicable to the present case: ""Consider, for example, that deceitful 
merchant A causes B to lose a great deal of money, as a result of which B defaults on a large loan from C, as a result of which 
C's business fails, as a result of which C's creditors D, E, F and G each suffers an ascertainable loss of money."" Ganim v. Smith 
& Wesson Corp., supra, 258 Conn. at 373 n.21. Under the plaintiff's reasoning, namely, that CUTPA is a remedial statute without 
a privity requirement, B, C, D, E, F and G all would have standing to pursue CUTPA claims against A. Likewise, under the 
plaintiff's reasoning, all persons or entities in the chain of distribution of Windows 98 including all end user licensees of Windows 
98, all of whom are indirect purchasers, would have standing to pursue CUTPA claims predicated on the defendant's allegedly 
anticompetitive conduct as long as they could demonstrate that the defendant's allegedly illegal overcharge was either wholly or 
partially passed onto them. We do not think that the legislature intended such a result when it removed CUTPA's privity 
requirement in P.A. 79-210."
1111,32," HN29[
] We previously have explained the concept of proximate cause as follows: ""Because the consequences of an act go 
endlessly forward in time and its causes stretch back to the dawn of human history, proximate cause is used essentially as a 
legal tool for limiting a wrongdoer's liability only to those harms that have a reasonable connection to his actions. The law has 
wisely determined that it is futile to trace the consequences of a wrongdoer's action to their ultimate end, if end there is.""

L. Ed. 2d 673 (2000). "
1112,33," Compare HN31[
] the three part policy analysis we employed in Ganim with the policy reasoning of the direct purchaser rule 
articulated by the United States Supreme Court in Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick: (1) the difficulty in determining the amount of 
an overcharge that the direct purchaser had passed onto indirect purchasers; (2) the risk of multiple recoveries; and (3) allowing 
only direct purchasers to bring private actions promotes vigorous enforcement of antitrust laws. E.g., Kansas v. Utilicorp United, 
Inc., supra, 497 U.S. at 208, 212, 214. "

1124,5," At oral argument, Plaintiffs did not mention (3) above in its request for relief. "
1130,6," Defendants argue that the Matsushita standard applicable to conspiracy cases based on ambiguous circumstantial evidence 
should be applied in this case. Defs.' Mem. at 18. However, Plaintiff asserts that Matsushita does not apply because there is

1133,8," Applying the standards set forth in Ty, Inc. v. The Jones Group, Inc., 98 F. Supp. 2d 988, 1002 (N.D. Ill. 2001), the court is 
unpersuaded that any genuine and material or well-disputed factual issue exists herein and that an evidentiary hearing would be 
productive. The court therefore finds that an evidentiary hearing is not necessary in resolving the Motion for Preliminary 
Injunction, and that the Motion is decidable on the papers filed and oral argument presented to the court. It bears noting that 
after the court indicated that an evidentiary hearing on the motion would not be required, at a minimum, the Plaintiff did not 
oppose this determination. "
1134,9," Under the conventional reasonable likelihood of success on the merits test, traditionally employed by courts of equity, Plaintiff's 
conspiracy case would not prevail."
1134,10," Parenthetically: it appears, realistically, as Defendants argue, that if a preliminary injunction is granted, it will, at the least, be 
difficult to roll back the situation to the present status quo if the Defendants prevail at trial."
1134,11," Although Plaintiff has a stronger case as to the other preliminary injunction elements (e.g. inadequate remedy at law, 
irreparable harm, public interest), in view of the court's holding, the court deems it unnecessary to decide those elements herein. In view of our holding herein, it also is deemed unnecessary to decide Plaintiff's threshold argument that no legal basis (or 
precedent) exists here to compel Defendants to furnish their ""proprietary"" data to Plaintiff. "
1154,1," The food service industry includes restaurants, hotels, airline companies, other out-of-home food service providers and 
distributors who service the food service industry. Glass tableware is sold primarily into three channels of distribution: 
food service, retail and specialty/industrial. (Defendants' Amended Joint Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of 
Law (""Defs.' Am. Proposed Findings"") PP 19-20 at 8.) "
1155,2," Throughout this opinion ""Compl."" refers to the Plaintiff's Complaint for Preliminary Injunction Pursuant to Section 13(b) of 
the Federal Trade Commission Act and ""Am. Compl."" refers to the Plaintiff's Amended Complaint for Preliminary 
Injunction Pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act."
1155,3," ""Soda lime glass[ware] is a mixture . . . of sand and soda ash, which is melted in a furnace at temperatures ranging 
from 24- [presumably the witness meant 2400] to 2800 degrees Fahrenheit."" (Plaintiff's Exhibit (""Pl.'s Ex."") 629 
Deposition of Mark Eichhorn dated September 20, 2001 at 18:11-17.) Soda lime glassware differs from ""lead crystal"" which 
is more expensive and fragile than glassware and is used primarily in fine dining establishments. (Pl.'s Mot. at 17.) Soda lime 
glassware also differs from plastic drinkware which scratches easily and progressively diminishes in clarity each time it is 
cleaned in a dishwasher. (Id. at 16.) Neither Anchor nor Libbey considers lead crystal or plastic pricing in determining the pricing 
of their soda-lime glassware. (Id. at 17.)"
1155,4," Throughout this opinion the terms ""food service glassware"" and ""soda-lime glassware"" are used interchangeably."
1155,5," Aside from distributors, Libbey's other food service customers include restaurants (such as Outback Steakhouse), hotels (such 
as Marriott), and airline companies (such as United Airlines). (Defendants' Joint Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of 
Law (""Defs.' Proposed Findings"") P 20 at 17.)"
1155,6," In its proposed findings, the FTC alternatively states that Libbey has ""a market share of over 65 percent in the food service 
glassware market"" (Pl.'s Proposed Findings P 234 at 74) and that Libbey is the ""market leader with an approximate 72 [percent] 
share of the food service glassware market[.]"" (Pl.'s Proposed Findings P 210 at 66.)"
1155,7," Defendants contend that competitors in the market ""include both manufacturers and sellers with no manufacturing capacity."" 
(Defendants' Amended Joint Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (""Defs.' Am. Proposed Findings"") P 25.) The 
competitors included under this definition, according to defendants, include both foreign and domestic companies, namely: 
""Libbey, Anchor Hocking, Oneida, Schott Zweisel, Pasabache, Bormioli Rocco, Kedaung, Lancaster Colony/Indiana Glass, 
World Kitchen, Krosno, Durobor N.V. Arc International and Cardinal."" (Id.)"
1155,8," Defendants identify Cardinal International as a significant competitor in the food service glassware industry in the United 
States, however, Cardinal International only distributes glassware manufactured by Arc International under an exclusive 
distribution agreement. (Defs.' Am. Proposed Findings P 27 at 10.)"
1155,9," The second largest share of the market belongs to Arc International, who has approximately a ten percent share of the market. 
(Pl.'s Proposed Findings P 210 at 66.) Oneida has an approximate market share of three percent. (Id.)"
1155,10," The Commission does not contend that the proposed acquisition by Libbey of Anchor's retail glassware business would 
significantly reduce competition in the retail glassware market, which is dominated mainly by imported glassware suppliers. (Pl.'s 
Motion at 2, ftnt. 3.) "
1156,11," ""Retail customers are stores that re-sell glass tableware to the ultimate consumer"" and include department stores (such as 
J.C. Penny's), mass merchandisers (such as Kmart), speciality stores (such as Crate & Barrel) and warehouse clubs (such as 
Costco). (Defs.' Proposed Findings P 21 at 17.)"
1156,12," Like Anchor, Oneida also sells Libbey look-alikes, but on a smaller scale than Anchor. (Pl.'s Mot. at 3.)"
1156,13," For example, Libbey's ""Primary Distributor Program"" (""PDP"") rewarded Libbey distributors who purchased glassware 
exclusively from Libbey and penalized distributors who purchased Libbey look-alikes from Anchor and Oneida. (Pl.'s Mot. at 38.) 
Until recently, PDP distributors who purchased Libbey look-alikes lost ""50% of earned rebates."" (Id.) Libbey has since 
abandoned its PDP. (Id.) Libbey's current rebate program, in part, ""requires distributors to purchase at least 130 SKUs [Sales 
Keeping Units] of Libbey items in order to qualify for rebates."" (Id. at 39.)"
1156,14," As required by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Improvements Act of 1976, 15 U.S.C. § 18 (""HSR Act""), Libbey and Newell filed 
a Premerger Notification and Report Form with the FTC on June 20, 2001, which advised the FTC of Libbey's proposed 
acquisition of Anchor. (Reply Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs Motion for Preliminary Injunction (""Pl.'s Reply"") at 
5.) "
1157,15," Industrial or speciality glassware sales are those made to original equipment manufacturers who use the glass 
product as components of their own products, such as candles, vases and light fixtures. (Defs.' Proposed Findings P 
22 at 18.)"
1157,16," Nine percent of the glassware produced in Anchor's factories is sold in the food service industry. In 2001, Anchor 
had domestic glassware sales of approximately $ 197 million, of which $ 17.6 million were food service glassware 
products. (Defendants' Joint Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction (""Defs.' Joint 
Opp'n"") at 7.) However, Anchor also outsources, i.e., obtains from other manufacturers, some of its glassware. (Defs.' Am. 
Proposed Findings P 65 at 24.) Under the amended agreement, ""RCP will outsource all of its glassware."" (Id. P 58 at 21.)"
1157,17," Many molds are used to make glassware products that are sold to both food service and retail customers. (Defs.' Am. 
Proposed Findings P 62 at 22.) Under the amended agreement, Libbey would acquire molds that are sold ""primarily to retail 
customers, and in trivial amounts to food service customers."" (Id. P 64 at 23.) For example, Libbey will acquire the molds 
necessary to make ""large glass storage jars,"" which accounted for approximately $ 1.1 million of Anchor's 2001 sales to food 
service customers but accounted for over $ 5.8 million of Anchor's 2001 sales to retail customers. (Id.) "
1158,18," Libbey assured the FTC that it would not consummate the acquisition until the Court ruled on the FTC's motion for a 
preliminary injunction, except on 10-days prior notice to the FTC. (Pl.'s Mot. at 5.)"
1158,19," It was not clear from the amended complaint whether the FTC's staff attorneys had received authorization from the 
Commission to file it. As a result, the Court construed Section 13(b) of the FTCA, 15 U.S.C § 53(b), to require the 
Commission's authorization before its staff attorneys could file the amended complaint challenging the amended merger 
agreement. Consequently, on March 29, 2002, the Court issued an Order directing counsel for the FTC to advise the 
Court whether the Commission had authorized its staff attorneys to file the amended complaint. On April 2, 2002, the 
FTC submitted its response in which it informed the Court that it does not construe Section 13(b) of the FTCA,  15 
U.S.C. § 53(b), to require the Commission to formally authorize the filing of an amended complaint in ""every case where 
merging parties amend a merger agreement that the Commission has found reason to believe violates the antitrust 
laws."" (Plaintiffs Submission in Response to the Court's March 29, 2002 Order (""Pl.'s Submission"") at 2.) Nevertheless, 
the Commission advised the Court that it had ""reaffirmed"" its decision to challenge the proposed merger agreement, 
even as amended. (Pl.'s Submission at 3.) Accordingly, the Court now concludes that the amended complaint and agreement 
are properly before it."
1158,20," The FTC contends that Newell's plan to outsource from Peldar (also known as Cristar) is problematic for several additional 
reasons, including import tariffs and other carrying costs that RCP would likely incure, which could make glassware obtained 
from Peldar as much as 42% higher than Anchor's current glassware acquisition supply costs. (Pl.'s Reply at 23.)"
1158,21," The defendants do not dispute that they restructured their agreement ""[to] meet their original strategic business objectives 
while resolving the FTC's concerns."" (Defs.' Joint Opp'n at 2.) "
1160,22," The Court in Heinz concluded that this ""analytical approach,"" which was developed in United States v. Baker Hughes, Inc., 
285 U.S. App. D.C. 222, 908 F.2d 981, 982-83 (D.C. Cir. 1990), had proper application in deciding whether a merger should be 
enjoined, even though the approach was originally employed at the merits stage in Baker Hughes."
1160,23," During the oral argument that was held in this matter defense counsel for Libbey stated that defendants do not concede the 
relevant market, but for the purpose of addressing plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction they would not contest the FTC's 
contention that the relevant market is food service glassware. (Transcript of Proceedings held on February 25, 2002 (""Tr."") at 
88.)"
1160,24," The FTC states that ""the United States as a whole constitutes a relevant geographic market within the meaning of the anti-
trust laws and a ""section of the county"" within the meaning of Section 7 of the Clayton Act."" (Pl.'s Proposed Findings P 59 at 
228.) Libbey, through its expert witness, Dr. Pindyck, indicates that the relevant glass tableware market includes ""all domestic 
and foreign companies who have the ability to sell glass tableware in the U.S."" (Defs.' Proposed Findings P 154 at 63.) "
1161,25," Defendants argue that plaintiffs challenge to Newell's internal transfer of its food service glassware business cannot support 
an injunction under the Section 7 of the Clayton Act because internal reorganizations are not reportable under the HSR Act. 
(Defs' Opp'n at 16.) Defendants' argument misses the point. Plaintiff does not merely challenge the internal transfer of Newell's 
food service glassware business. Rather, plaintiff challenges the acquisition by Libbey of portions of Anchor's business, which is 
reportable under the HSR Act, and alleges that the acquisition will have an anti-competitive effect that, in part, will occur as a 
result of Newell's internal transfer of its food service glassware business to RCP."
1161,26," Part of the purpose of the mandatory notification procedures provided in  15 U.S.C. § 18a is to provide the federal 
antitrust enforcement agencies (the FTC and the Department of Justice) with advance notice of proposed mergers and 
acquisitions, so they can decide whether or not to challenge the transactions on antitrust grounds. (See Defs.' Ex. 167, 
FTC Introductory Guide I to the Premerger Notification Program, at 1.) "
1162,27," The Court is not unsympathetic to the FTC's argument that parties to an agreement might, in some cases, unscrupulously 
attempt to avoid judicial and FTC review of an agreement by continuously amending it. However, based upon the facts of this 
case, the Court is not convinced that defendants were in fact purposely attempting to avoid judicial and FTC review of their 
agreement. Rather, they made a good-faith effort to address the FTC's concerns regarding the agreement, which it seems is 
consistent with the policies underlying Section 7."
1162,28," In its March 2000 food service strategy plan, (Pl.'s Exh. 566), Anchor planned to ""capitalize on [the] elimination of Libbey['s] 
PDP; aggressively pursue lost business. . . .; offer [a] complimentary program to Oneida [and . . . find [a] partner to gain leverage 
against Libbey and Oneida . . .""). (Pl's Ex. 566 at 000486.) "
1163,29," This fact is intriguing as defendants argue that outsourcing was responsible for approximately $ 1.1 million of Anchor's 2001 
sales, (Defs.' Am. Proposed Findings P 65 at 24), and, as a result of the amended agreement, all of RCP's glassware would be 
outsourced. "
1164,30," ""The HHI is calculated by squaring the individual market shares of all the firms in the market and adding up the squares. The 
HHI takes into account the relative size and distribution of the firms in a market, increasing both as the number of firms in the 
market decreases and as the disparity in size among those firms increases."" Staples, 970 F. Supp. at 1081 n.12. "
1165,31," According to the FTC, even using the figures of defendants' expert witness, Professor Pindyck, the original proposed merger 
would have resulted in a post-merger HHI of 3329, with an HHI increase of 589. (Pl.'s Proposed Findings P 225 at 71.)"
1165,32," Specifically, defendants argue that ""foreign-sourced glassware is typically less expensive than its domestic counterparts, 
despite transportation costs and tariffs, because labor cost[s] are far lower than in most other countries."" (Defs.' Am. Proposed 
Findings P 77 at 28.) "
1166,33," A primary benefit to the economy is a merger's potential to generate efficiencies. Heinz, 246 F.3d at 720. Efficiencies ""'can 
enhance the merged firm's ability and incentive to compete, which may result in lower prices, improved quality, or new products."" 
Id. (citing U.S. Dep't of Justice & Federal Trade Comm'n, Horizontal Merger Guidelines § 4 (1992), as revised (1997)). "
1167,34," Defendants argue that FTC's statement regarding the Canadian plant is ""disingenuous"" because the Canadian plant was 
""outdated"" and inefficient and is not comparable to the plants it plans to acquire under the amended agreement. (Defs.' Am. 
Findings P 53 at 18-19.) However, while the FTC's evidence does not establish that Libbey will in fact close the plants it would 
acquire from Newell, it tends to demonstrate, along with the other evidence presented, that such an event could occur. "

the right to accept or reject any or all proposals received as a result of this request, to negotiate with all qualified sources, and to

166. Ameritech submitted a copy of the 1995 RFP as an exhibit attached to a motion to dismiss. The plaintiffs argue that the district 
court should not have considered matters outside the pleadings. Appellants' Br. at 17. However, as Ameritech observes, the 
plaintiffs referred to the 1995 RFP in their complaint. The 1995 RFP was central to the plaintiffs' claims and thus was properly 
considered. See  Jackson v. City of Columbus, 194 F.3d 737, 745 (6th Cir. 1999) HN1[
] (""Documents attached to a motion to 
dismiss are considered part of the pleadings if they are referred to in the plaintiff's complaint and are central to the plaintiff's 
claim."")."
1177,2," The telephone is recessed into the wall, making the intercom virtually indestructible. Unlike traditional box units, which consist 
of a handset connected to the telephone by a long steel cord, this design prevents prisoners from (1) converting the cord or 
handset into a weapon and (2) vandalizing or otherwise abusing the phones."
1177,3," The plaintiffs allege that Ameritech's bid contained the traditional box unit design and thus failed to comply with the 1995 RFP's 
requirement that the telephone equipment be ""vandalism proof."" J.A. at 14 (Compl. at P 20). "
1178,4," The plaintiffs allege that Ameritech's bid proposed an illegal rate for collect calls, which would qualify as predatory pricing and 
thus violate federal antitrust laws."
1178,5," The City submitted a copy of the memo itself as an exhibit attached to a motion for summary judgment. As the plaintiffs argue, 
this memo was not accompanied by an affidavit or document that attested to its validity or authenticity. Appellants' Br. at 19. We 
have previously ""ruled that HN2[
] documents submitted in support of a motion for summary judgment must satisfy the requirements of Rule 56(e); otherwise, they must be disregarded."" Logan v. Denny's, Inc., 259 F.3d 558, 570 (6th Cir. 2001) 
(quoting Moore v. Holbrook, 2 F.3d 697, 699 (6th Cir. 1993)). Because the plaintiffs raised this issue in the court below, they 
have not forfeited this objection. See  Johnson v. United States Postal Serv., 64 F.3d 233, 237 (6th Cir. 1995). However, Napoleon essentially reiterates Miller's conclusions in the memo that the plaintiffs attached to their complaint as 
Exhibit C. We therefore rely on Napoleon's references to Miller's memo. "
1182,6," In Consolidated Television, a private, for-profit corporation alleged that a nonprofit corporation had violated federal antitrust 
laws by unlawfully conspiring to prevent free competition between the two entities in the provision of cable television service for 
the City of Frankfort, Kentucky.  Consolidated Television, 857 F.2d at 355. We concluded that the defendant was entitled to state 
action immunity from antitrust claims because it was a municipal agent, rather than a purely private actor, and thus did not have 
to show active state supervision. Id. at 358-60. Ameritech does not raise such an argument in this case."
1182,7," At oral argument, Ameritech cited the Supreme Court's Columbia decision for the proposition that municipal supervision is 
sufficient to immunize a private actor from federal antitrust liability. However, the Columbia Court held that the private defendant 
in that case was entitled to immunity under Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 5 
L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523 (1961), which ""shields from the Sherman Act a concerted effort to influence public officials 
regardless of intent or purpose."" Columbia, 499 U.S. at 379-80 (quoting Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 670, 14 L. 
Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585 (1965)). HN13[
] The Noerr-Pennington exemption thus applies to lobbyists and others whose legitimate attempts to influence governmental action are protected by the First Amendment as political activity. In contrast, our 
effective-decision-maker doctrine addresses whether a private defendant has actually corrupted or overtaken rather than merely 
influenced a municipality's decision-making process. We recognize that other courts have extended state action immunity beyond this limit. See, e.g., Tri-State Rubbish, Inc. v. Waste 
Mgmt., Inc., 998 F.2d 1073, 1079 (1st Cir. 1993) (holding that ""municipal supervision of private actors is adequate where 
authorized or implicit in the state legislation""). However, until the Supreme Court squarely addresses the question whether 
municipal supervision protects the anticompetitive acts of private parties, we are bound by this circuit's decision in Riverview and 
must read Ticor to preclude Parker immunity in such cases absent active supervision by the state itself. "
1183,8," HN17[
] In Michigan, the Statute of Frauds requires that contracts unable ""to be performed within 1 year from the making of 
the agreement"" are void unless the agreement is made ""in writing and signed with an authorized signature by the party to be 
charged."" Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 566.132 (West 2001). The Statute of Frauds is applicable in this case because MPJV's 
1995 bid stated that the in-cell telephone contract would last for five years. Although numerous written documents are at issue in 
this case, the plaintiffs cannot establish the validity of any ""contract"" because the City made no commitment in writing. "
1184,9," Because the plaintiffs referred to the 1996 RFP in their complaint, and the 1996 RFP was central to the plaintiffs' claims, we 
may consider this document. See supra note 1."
1184,10," MPJV argues that the City's discretion in awarding contracts is limited under the lowest responsible bidder provisions of the 
Detroit City Code. Appellants' Br. at 25-26. HN19[
] The Detroit City Code specifies the manner in which the City's purchasing 
director may make purchases that entail a ""major expenditure."" Detroit City Code § 18-5-2. In the case of purchase contracts for 
equipment and supplies, a major expenditure is one that exceeds $ 50,000. Detroit City Code § 18-5-1. However, MPJV fails to rebut the City's contention that the DPD contract was a revenue rather than a purchase contract. 
Appellee (City)'s Br. at 23-24. Revenue contracts are governed by Detroit City Code § 18-5-5, which requires the Detroit City 
Council to approve ""all revenue contracts, regardless of dollar value."" Id. On its face, the 1995 RFP states that one of its primary 
objectives is to gain ""[a] new revenue source for the City of Detroit."" J.A. at 166. The resolution passed by the Detroit City 
Council that awarded the DPD contract to Ameritech also described the contract as ""a revenue contract . . . with compensation 
to be paid to the City."" J.A. at 262. We agree with the City and conclude that the lowest responsible bidder provisions are not 
applicable in this case. "
1185,11," In addition, in the accompanying footnote, the district court stated, ""Even if this Court were to find that Noah sufficiently 
established standing to bring a taxpayer action, dismissal [without prejudice] would nevertheless be appropriate . . . because no 
viable federal claims remain."" J.A. at 116-17 n.8. This conditional language provides further support for our conclusion that the 
district court held that Noah did not have standing. "
1200,1," In an effort to recoup public health care costs and to reduce cigarette smoking, several states brought suits against the leading 
domestic cigarette manufacturers. A large majority of these suits were settled pursuant to the Master Settlement Agreement. 
Signatory manufacturers, as well as non-signatory manufacturers, are affected by the terms of the Master Settlement 
Agreement. "
1201,2," AOMs include new entrants as well as established cigarette manufacturers, such as Liggett Group, Inc., other than PM, RJR, 
B&W, and Lorillard."
1201,3," In 2001, the Federal Trade Commission reported that domestic cigarette sales declined from approximately 524 billion 
cigarettes in 1990 to approximately 411 billion cigarettes in 1999. Federal Trade Commission Cigarette Report for 1999, March 
13, 2001, 2001 WL 273064 (F.T.C.). These figures demonstrate the decreasing demand that has resulted in each Plaintiff's 
substantial excess capacity. Each Plaintiff could increase production by a rate between 15% and 30%. (Expert Report of 
Kenneth G. Elzinga July 31, 2001, in Supp. of Def.'s Opp'n to RJR's Mot. to Modify the Prelim. Inj. at 23-24 (citing Pls.' Resps. to 
Def.'s Second Set of Interrogs.).) "
1204,4," Price call-out signs must convey a price message on 2/3 of the sign, and the remaining 1/3 of the sign may convey an equity 
message. "
1205,5," MSA Shipment Data and Marlin Take-Away Data are types of marketing data upon which the parties regularly rely. The parties 
also cite to IRI-Capstone Data. "
1206,6," Workload volume is a term that describes the volume of a manufacturer's total sales at stores that a manufacturer calls on 
regularly. Some of the sales data in the record before the court is presented as workload volume and other data are presented 
as cigarette industry volume (CIV). CIV figures are more appropriate for the present analysis because they reflect the relevant 
product and geographic markets--all retail cigarettes sold in the United States."
1206,7," Plaintiffs failed to provide CIV figures for CMO2 stores. The figure Plaintiffs submitted to the court regarding CMO2 stores 
(15.8% of PM's workload volume) fails to reflect the relevant market in that it is based on PM's workload volume rather than CIV. 
Furthermore, this figure overstates the penetration of PM's CMO2 contracts. Using the 15.8% of PM's workload volume, in 
comparison with CMO3 workload volume and CIV figures, yields a CMO2 CIV figure of approximately 10% to 11% [(% of PM's 
workload volume at CMO3)/(% of CIV at CMO3)=(% of PM's workload volume at CMO2)/(% of CIV at CMO2)]. Viewing these 
figures in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs and allowing a margin of error, the court will use 12% of CIV to represent PM's 
penetration of CMO2 contracts."
1206,8," There is some dispute whether CMO3 stores represented 31% or 34% of CIV in September 2001. RJR data indicate that the 
appropriate percentage is 31%, while PM data indicate that CMO3 stores represented 34% CIV. Because all reasonable facts 
are viewed in favor of the non-moving party, the court will assume that 34% of CIV was sold in CMO3 stores in September 2001. "
1207,9," RJR changed its definition of ""PM exclusive"" in January of 2001. RJR initially defined all stores signed to the highest level of 
Retail Leaders as ""PM exclusive."" However, when RJR began signing to its merchandising contracts stores at the highest level 
of Retail Leaders, RJR changed its definition to mean those stores that had only a PM contract. Because RJR did not initially 
attempt to sign to its merchandising contracts stores at the highest level of Retail Leaders, the change in definition did not 
account for a significant difference. In December 2000, before the definition change, 15% of CIV was sold in stores that RJR 
classified as ""PM exclusives."" Under RJR's new definition, January 2001 data showed that 13% of CIV was sold in stores that "
1208,," RJR classified as ""PM exclusives."" Regardless of RJR's definition change, the fact remains that the number of stores that RJR 
defines as ""PM exclusive"" has dropped since 1999."
1208,10," PM also places high importance on non-retail marketing activities. In 2000, PM spent in excess of $ 600 million on these 
activities. "
1212,11," Lorillard has its highest level contract in 7% more pack outlets after Retail Leaders than before Retail Leaders. Lorillard also 
has its highest level contract in 42% more cigarette and tobacco stores after Retail Leaders than before Retail Leaders."
1212,12," Average retail prices of premium brands during the period from January 1, 1999, to August 25, 2001, are as follows (in order 
of decreasing prices): Newport $ 3.08; Salem $ 2.89; Kool $ 2.88; Camel (filters) $ 2.87; Marlboro $ 2.86; Winston $ 2.73."
1212,13," Plaintiffs attempt to explain away the fact that their prices are at the same level as (and sometimes higher than) PM's prices by 
relying upon expert opinions that Retail Leaders reduces Plaintiffs' incentives to promote and discount their brands. See, e.g., 
Warren-Boulton Nov. 28, 2001, Decl. in Supp. of Pls.' Mem. in Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 7-8 (alleging that Retail 
Leaders reduces ""Plaintiffs' incentives to promote aggressively"" and arguing that such a reduction ""plausibly explain[s] why 
Plaintiffs' retail prices might be higher than PM's""). Plaintiffs' argument and the speculation of Plaintiffs' experts on this point are 
undercut by record evidence demonstrating that since Retail Leaders was introduced, RJR, Lorillard, and B&W, along with PM, "
1213,," have actually increased promotions, discounts, and merchandising payments to retailers. Thus, Plaintiffs' expert opinions on this 
point are entitled to little weight. See  Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 242, 125 L. Ed. 
2d 168, 113 S. Ct. 2578 (1993)."
1213,14," For example, federal law prohibits cigarette advertising on television and radio. 15 U.S.C. § 1335. Also, the Master Settlement 
Agreement prohibits cigarette advertising on billboards. "
1214,15," Professor Hay attempts to demonstrate the extent of product differentiation in the retail cigarette market by pointing out the 
disparity in pricing between Marlboro (a premium brand) and Malibu (a deep-discount brand). Professor Hay claims that 
Marlboro's 44% higher price than Malibu in the fourth quarter of 2000 is inconsistent with a fungible product industry. However, 
Professor Hay seems to ignore the fact that, as indicated by the relevant market, all cigarettes compete with all other cigarettes, 
a fact clearly supported by the record. Professor Hay's position on this point is quite similar to the largely discredited theory of 
submarkets. See IIA Phillip E. Areeda, Herbert Hovenkamp, & John L. Solow, Antitrust Law P 533e (1995) (characterizing 
submarket theory as ""a confusing diversion from the key question whether rival producers . . . constrain a defendant's power"" 
and stating that the degree of power inherent in differentiated products is almost uniformly insufficient to make each brand a "
1215,," separate market). Furthermore, in an earlier case in this district the parties, which included B&W, agreed that the relevant 
market for antitrust claims involving the cigarette industry was all cigarette sales in the United States. Liggett Group, Inc. v. 
Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 748 F. Supp. 344 (M.D.N.C. 1990), aff'd, 964 F.2d 335 (4th Cir. 1992), aff'd sub nom.  
Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williams Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168, 113 S. Ct. 2578 (1993)."
1215,16," Because Plaintiffs have the ability to communicate with consumers in order to sell their products, Plaintiffs' substantial excess 
capacity acts as a guard against any possible attempt by PM to engage in supracompetitive pricing. If pricing were at 
supracompetitive levels, resulting in unsatisfied market demand, Plaintiffs could inject their substantial excess capacity into the 
market at competitive prices in order to correct the supracompetitive pricing. The fact that Plaintiffs currently possess substantial 
excess capacity that they are not injecting into the market demonstrates that there exists neither supracompetitive pricing nor 
unsatisfied market demand resulting therefrom in need of correction. "
1216,17," In 2000, PM spent in excess of $ 600 million on non-retail marketing activities. RJR spent approximately $ 600 million in 2000 
on these activities. Lorillard spent $ 396 million in 2000 on direct consumer promotions (which includes buydowns), and, in 2000, 
B&W spent approximately $ 96.2 million on non-retail marketing activities. "
1217,18," Plaintiffs contend that Retail Leaders should face a higher level of scrutiny under antitrust analysis but offer no legitimate 
reason for such heightened scrutiny. "
1218,19," Plaintiffs argue that workload volume is the proper figure to consider for foreclosure rates because stores that PM does not 
call on are essentially beyond reach because it is not cost effective to call on them. CIV figures, however, are more appropriate 
for the foreclosure analysis because they reflect the relevant product and geographic markets--all retail cigarettes sold in the 
United States. "
1219,20," Because these stores are not truly ""PM exclusive,"" 14% may be too high as well. Retailers generally carry manufacturers' 
products in these stores even though they do not have merchandising contracts in these stores. Furthermore, Plaintiffs are free 
to negotiate merchandising contracts with these stores."
1219,21," Plaintiffs argue that the increased penetration of their merchandising programs is the result of lowering their requirements that 
retailers must meet. PM's increased penetration, however, is also a result, at least in part, of PM relaxing signage restrictions 
and increasing promotional payments. The effect of the parties lowering the requirements imposed on retailers who wish to sign 
merchandising contracts is to increase competition for retail display and advertising space at the pre-contract stage. "
1220,22," When considering the coercive effect of Retail Leaders, it is proper to focus on the number of stores that are ""coerced"" 
because each store makes an individual decision whether or not, and at what level, to sign a Retail Leaders agreement."
1220,23," RJR's Chief Executive Officer recognizes this and attributes Marlboro's success to ""great positioning, great advertising, you 
know, a really good product."" (Schindler, March 27, 2001, Dep. at 40.) "
1222,24," HN36[
] Courts have long found that conduct which does not support a Section 1 claim cannot support a Section 2 claim. Williams v. I.B. Fischer Nevada, 999 F.2d 445, 448 (9th Cir. 1993) (quoting Thomsen v. Western Elec. Co., 680 F.2d 1263, 1267 
(9th Cir. 1982)) (""[A] § 1 claim insufficient to withstand summary judgment cannot be used as the sole basis for a § 2 claim.""); 
Foremost Pro Color, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 703 F.2d 534, 543 (9th Cir. 1983) (holding that because the conduct the plaintiff 
alleged in support of its Section 1 claim is not anticompetitive, ""it is of no assistance to [the plaintiff's] efforts to state a claim for 
relief for monopolization or attempted monopolization, both of which require at least some allegation of anticompetitive 
conduct""), overruled on other grounds,  Hasbrouck v. Texaco, Inc., 842 F.2d 1034, 1043 (9th Cir. 1987); see also  United States 
v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 224 n.59, 84 L. Ed. 1129, 60 S. Ct. 811 (1940) (""The two sections overlap in the sense 
that a monopoly under § 2 is a species of restraint under § 1."") (citing Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 1, 59-61, 55 L. 
Ed. 619, 31 S. Ct. 502 (1911)). "
1223,25," Defendant has also filed motions seeking to exclude portions of the expert reports, declarations, and anticipated testimony of 
Plaintiffs' economic experts. Because Defendant's motions are directed primarily at portions of the experts' opinions which the 
court has found to be insufficiently tied to the facts or contrary to the undisputed evidence in the record, the court need not 
address the objections independently. "
1229,1," Neither at the hearing nor in its Reasons for Judgment did the trial court address Black & Decker's peremptory exception of no 
cause of action or dilatory exceptions of vagueness and improper cumulation of actions."
1229,2," Plaintiff alleged that Black & Decker is a foreign corporation whose principal place of business is Towson, Maryland."
1229,3," Plaintiff alleged that Beerman and Industrial Welding are Louisiana corporations authorized to do business in the State of 
Louisiana. "
1231,4," La. R.S. 51:121 defines commerce as ""trade or commerce within this state."" "
1240,1," The defendants shall be referred to collectively as the ""Tour."" Plaintiff also sued several tournament sponsors. The sponsor 
defendants have been dismissed. See Toscano v. PGA Tour, Inc., 70 F. Supp.2d 1109 (E.D. Cal. 1999), aff'd, Toscano v. 
Professional Golfers Association, 258 F.3d 978 (9th Cir. 2001). "
1241,2, Only one golfer qualifies in this category: Jack Nicklaus. 
1242,3," The Senior PGA Tour also co-sponsors commercially lucrative invitational tournaments, and other special events including 
Senior Skins Games, Senior Slams, Legends of Golf, the Seniors Championship, and professional-amateur (""pro-am"") events. 
Tour invitationals are comprised of the top 20 players from the Official All-Time Career Money List, the top 20 players from the 
prior year's Official Senior PGA Tour Money List, and the players or class of players specifically invited by the tournament 
sponsors. (Senior PGA Tour Tournament Rules and Regulations at 14, Exh. 4 to Maledon Aff.). Pro-ams are tournaments held 
on the weekdays preceding tournaments. They permit amateurs to pay in order to play alongside Senior PGA Tour golfers. (Id. 
at 16-20). Proceeds from the pro-am go primarily to local charities. Finally, the remaining special events all have distinct 
qualifications but are generally reserved for the most successful and popular Tour players. (Id. at 68)."
1242,4," The Tour also has a marketing rights rule which restricts the ability of persons to make commercial use of the Tour's name, 
marks, or logo, without advance approval. (Senior PGA Tour Tournament Regulations and Handbook at 28, Exh. 4 to Maledon 
Aff.). "
1243,5," Although Toscano describes his status as being ""conditional exempt,"" it does not appear to be specifically defined in the Senior 
PGA Tour Rules and Regulations."
1243,6," The PGA Tour allegedly told Norman that it would enforce the media rights and conflicting events rules to prevent Tour 
members from playing on his proposed ""World Tour."" (Complaint at P 85; Tollison Aff. at 7 n.9). However, Norman's proposed 
tour was for golfers at the regular PGA Tour level, not for senior golfers. (Toscano Depo. at 107:7-10). "
1244,7," The specific claims raised in the Third Amended Complaint include: (1) monopolization and attempted monopolization against 
the PGA, 15 U.S.C. § 2; (2) monopsonization and attempted monopsonization against the PGA, 15 U.S.C. § 2; (3) boycott 
against the PGA, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 2; (4) attempted monopolization against Beman, Finchem, and the player directors, 15 U.S.C. 
§ 2; (5) boycott against PGA, Beman, Finchem, and the player directors, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 2; (6) boycott against the player 
directors, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 2; (7) boycott, 15 U.S.C. § 1. Two additional claims against golfer David Stockton were dismissed by 
plaintiff prior to hearing on the Tour's motion. "
1245,8," For purposes of this motion, defendants do not challenge Toscano's description of the market. (Reply at 14 n.8). "
1246,9," Beyond the mere allegations contained in his complaint, Toscano has failed to provide any evidence that any Senior PGA Tour 
rivals were precluded from entering the market due to anticompetitive activity. Toscano's own expert witness conceded that he 
had never even spoken with anyone associated with the Nitro Senior Series about the impact of the conflicting event or media 
rights rule or whether they were unable to attract marquee players. (Tollison Depo. at 148:6-23). Likewise, Toscano never 
attempted to determine why Greg Norman's proposed tour, for regular PGA level players, never got off the ground. Finally, the 
evidence submitted by Dr. Tollison which purportedly shows that it is more expensive to purchase advertising--calculated as the 
cost of advertising per thousand viewers reached--for golf tournaments than for any other sporting event, is equally consistent 
with the fact that there are fewer viewers of golf tournaments as it is with the fact that the Tour's rules artificially constrain the 
market. (See Tollison Aff.)."
1246,10," Toscano's sole attempt to demonstrate a direct injury caused by the media and conflicting events rules--he was playing on the 
Senior Series in 1997 when it shut down allegedly due to the rules--is misplaced. (Opp. at 18). This evidence merely 
demonstrates that Toscano has a personal injury that is not duplicative of an injury suffered by the Senior Series. It does not, 
however, prove that Toscano's injury was directly caused by the alleged anticompetitive conduct. "
1247,11," There is no merit to Toscano's argument that in considering the question of standing, Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide, 
370 U.S. 690, 698-99, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777, 82 S. Ct. 1404 (1962), compels the court to aggregate the effects of the media and 
conflicting events rules and the eligibility rules. First, as the Ninth Circuit observed in Vinci v. Waste Mgmt., Continental Ore 
""does not apply to the issue whether a person has standing to challenge antitrust behavior."" Id. 80 F.3d 1372, 1374 (9th Cir. 
1996). Thus, whatever the meaning of a Supreme Court decision rendered prior to substantial later developments in antitrust 
law, the Ninth Circuit does not require its application to the question of standing. Second, before the court could countenance a 
Continental Ore objection at the summary judgment stage, the plaintiff must produce something more than a bare allegation that 
the allegedly illicit conduct works in tandem to produce an anticompetitive result. Thus, at the least, Toscano must demonstrate 
that the defendants actually use the eligibility rules and the media and conflicting events rules in some concerted fashion for 
anticompetitive purposes. Toscano, has offered no such evidence. To this end, Toscano's expert, Dr. Tollison, stated that without the media rights and 
conflicting event rules, there would be competition, ""and resulting from competition, I think you would have loosened entry into 
tournaments."" (Tollison Depo. at 172:15-16). However, Tollison conceded that he had not done any studies to determine the 
validity of his hypothesis. (Id. at 172:17-19). This is the exact sort of unsubstantiated opinion that is insufficient to withstand 
scrutiny at the summary judgment stage. See United States v. Various Slot Machines on Guam, 658 F.2d 697, 700 (9th Cir. 
1991) (""In the context of a motion for summary judgment, an expert must back up his opinion with specific facts.""). Therefore, the 
court's standing inquiry is limited exclusively to the media rights and conflicting events rules. "
1249,12," See, e.g., M& H Tire Co. v. Hoosier Racing Tire Corp., 733 F.2d 973, 977-78 (1st Cir. 1984) (""The drivers are not in economic 
competition with one another and while they are specifying the parameters within which they will compete on the race track, 
what is missing is any effect upon economic competition among the drivers as was present in Fashion and Eastern States. While 
the tracks may be economic competitors in some sense, the rule does not limit economic competition among them either."") (rule 
that permitted only one tire to be used at race track did not violate antitrust law under rule of reason); Mid-South Grizzlies v. 
Nat'l Football League, 720 F.2d 772, 787 (3d Cir. 1983) (""The essential facilities doctrine is predicated on the assumption that 
admission of the excluded applicant would result in additional competition, in an economic rather than athletic sense. The 
Grizzlies have simply failed to show how competition in any arguably relevant market would be improved if they were given a 
share of the NFL's monopoly power.""); Baseball at Trotwood, LLC v. Dayton Prof'l Baseball Club, 113 F. Supp.2d 1164, 1172 
(S.D. Ohio 1999) (""the Plaintiffs were seeking to join the Midwest League, rather than to compete in an economic sense with that 
League, the owners of its teams or the [national league organization]"") (summary judgment for defendant, plaintiff did not suffer 
antitrust injury)."
1249,13," The sole case that Toscano cites in support of his argument, Medlin v. Prof'l Rodeo Cowboys Ass'n, Inc., 1991 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 20847, 1991 WL 340303 (D. Col. 1991), was a brief preliminary injunction order that does not cite any antitrust precedent 
and that was subsequently vacated nunc pro tunc as part of a stipulated order. Medlin v. Prof'l Rodeo Cowboy Ass'n, 1992 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 7653 (D. Col. March 31, 1992)."
1249,14," Tollison stated in his deposition: Q. ""You don't know, sir, whether or not the PGA TOUR's eligibility rules would be any different than they currently are if those 
two rules, the conflicting event and media rights rule, did not exist, correct? A. I do not. And I would -- and if they were, I would have [no] objection to it. Q. So you just don't know one way or another whether or not rescinding or doing away with the conflicting event and media 
rights rule would have in any way altered Mr. Toscano's ability to get into SENIOR PGA TOUR events? You don't know one way 
or the other, do you? A. No, I don't."" Tollison Depo. at 196:12-23. "
1250,15," The court's analysis of the eligibility rules under Section 1 of the Sherman Act also applies to Toscano's Section 2 claims 
because ""HN17[
] 'a § 1 claim insufficient to withstand summary judgment cannot be used as the sole basis for a § 2 claim.'"" Williams v. I.B. Fischer Nevada, 999 F.2d 445, 448 (9th Cir. 1993) (quoting Thomsen v. Western Elec. Co., 680 F.2d 1263, 1267 
(9th Cir. 1982)). "
1251,16," This calculation is actually more speculative than it first appears. It is based on Toscano's assumption that he would have 
qualified for a particular tournament if the eligibility rules were more relaxed, and that he would have shot the same score for 
each round of the tournament. For example, Toscano states that ""at the 2001 Transamerica Senior PGA Tour Tournament in 
Napa, I shot a 71 in Monday qualifying finishing fifth, missing the tournament by one spot. I would have won $ 8,580 if I had 
made the tournament and shot that score all week. (Toscano Aff. at P 14). "
1252,17," Toscano stated in his deposition that ""there's millions of senior players out there that have ability that you could--you can 
have--you could have more than one tournament a week going on."" Toscano Depo. at 110:18-19. "

1261,19," In Goldwasser, the Seventh Circuit dismissed a complaint in a case raising substantially similar facts to those at bar. Nearly 
every district court since then has relied on Goldwasser and dismissed antitrust claims based on conduct subject to the 1996 
Act. See, e.g.,  MGC Communications, Inc., v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 146 F. Supp. 2d 1344 (S.D. Fla. 2001); Law 
Offices of Curtis v. Trinko, LLP v. Bell Atlantic Corp., 123 F. Supp. 2d 738 (S.D.N.Y. 2000); Law Offices of Curtis v. Trinko, LLP

refusal to deal not barred by Goldwasser even though facts supporting those theories relate to duties under 1996 Act); Davis v. 
Pacific Bell, Nos. C 01-0260 & C 01-585 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 10, 2002). "
1263,20," Specifically, after its voluntary supply contracts with retail competitors expired, Otter Tail Power refused to sell energy to those 
competitors at wholesale prices and refused to agree to ""wheel"" power to them from other wholesale suppliers outside of Otter 
Tail's wholesale monopoly market area. Significantly, the Federal Power Commission had only very limited authority to order 
interconnections between utilities. In these circumstances, the Court enjoined Otter Tail either to sell its own power or to wheel 
power supplied by other wholesalers to the downstream retail level. Otter Tail Power, 410 U.S. at 377-382."
1263,21," Aspen Skiing and Otter Tail Power are the principal cases relied upon by Plaintiffs in support of their essential facility 
argument. Plaintiff also relies on MCI v. AT&T, 708 F.2d 1081 (7th Cir. 1983), in which the Seventh Circuit upheld a jury's 
determination that AT&T violated Section 2 by denying MCI interconnection to its local distribution facilities, thereby preventing it 
from offering certain long distance services. MCI, however, was a pre-1996 Act case, and interconnection was not subject to the 
level or kind of regulation and supervision that it is subject to under the current 1996 Act regime. See  MCI, 708 F.2d at 1103 
(""Although the FCC has authority to compel interconnection…the initial decision whether to interconnect rests with the utility, and "
1264,," the record shows that the FCC did not control and approve of AT&T's actions here. Nor has the FCC supervised AT&T's 
interconnection practices so closely that the FCC's approval could be inferred.""); see also 1A P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, supra, 
at P 240(d)(noting that the MCI court considered AT&T's failure to interconnect a refusal to deal because it was insufficiently 
supervised by the regulatory commission); see also Defs.' Reply at 14 (""the contrast with the 1996 Act could hardly be sharper -- 
there is no term of an interconnection agreement that an ILEC can impose on a CLEC for even a moment without a regulator's 
explicit approval"")."
1264,22," The degree to which a firm's discretion regarding interconnection is supervised by a regulatory regime is critical to application 
of antitrust principles. See  Otter Tail, 410 U.S. at 374 (finding antitrust liability in part because the interstate distribution of power 
was left to the ""voluntary commercial relationships"" rather than a ""pervasive regulatory scheme"" and because these relationships 
""are governed in the first instance by business judgment and not regulatory coercion.""); see also 1A P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, 
supra, at P 240c(1) (""In determining the appropriateness of antitrust intervention, the issue is…the impact of regulation on the 
particular conduct being challenged. Mainly, the antitrust tribunal needs to know whether the conduct (1) is the product of 
unsupervised discretion of the private firm… (2) was approved by a regulatory agency but with little thought for the impact of the 
conduct on competition;… (3) was approved by a regulatory inquiry that took full, statutorily authorized account of competitive 
effects…""). "
1265,23," In that action, the District Court held on cross motions for summary judgment that Covad did not infringe Bell Atlantic's patent. 
See  Bell Atlantic Network Services, Inc. v. Covad Communications Group, et al., 92 F. Supp. 2d 483 (E.D. Va. 2000). "

1285,1," Intel is a corporation that manufactures microprocessors for use in a computer's hardware. Computer manufacturers purchase 
these microprocessors from Intel for use in their Intel-based personal computers. Most computers manufactured throughout the 
world employ an Intel microprocessor and upwards of ninety percent of these Intel-based personal computers are shipped with a 
version of Microsoft Windows 98 pre-installed."
1285,2," We are in receipt of two post-argument motions to supplement the counter-statement and reply memorandum of defendant, 
Microsoft. The first motion references Berghausen v. Microsoft Corp., 765 N.E.2d 592 (Ind. Ct. App. 2002), a case recently 
decided by the Indiana Court of Appeals and the second motion references Vacco v. Microsoft Corp., 793 A.2d 1048 (Conn. "
1286,2002," ), a case recently decided by the Connecticut Supreme Court. As there has been no objection, we grant the motions, 
however, we conclude that the cases add nothing to our analysis."
1286,3," United States v. Microsoft Corp., 84 F. Supp. 2d 9 (D.D.C. 1999) was subsequently reversed in part, affirmed in part and 
remanded in part in United States v. Microsoft Corp., 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330, 253 F.3d 34 (D.C. Cir. 2001). The United States 
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the District Court's holding that Microsoft indeed was engaging in 
anti-competitive practices. "
1287,4," General Laws 1956 § 6-36-12 provides in pertinent part: HN13[
] ""(a) The attorney general may bring a civil action in superior court in the name of the state, as parens patriae on 
behalf of persons residing in this state, to secure monetary relief as provided in this section for injuries sustained by the 
persons to their property by reason of any violation of this chapter. ""* ** ""(g) In any action under this section the fact that a 
person or public body has not dealt directly with the defendant shall not bar or otherwise limit recovery."" "
1305,1," Sherman first acquired a majority ownership interest in Barr in the early 1980's, when he obtained more than 80% of Barr's 
stock. Sherman claims to be a ""portfolio investor"" in Barr and noted that he refrained from any ""active role"" in decisions at Barr to 
avoid any conflict with his other pharmaceutical interests. Barr's general counsel confirmed that Sherman is a ""passive investor"" 
in Barr and does not have ""effective control"" over the board of directors. "
1306,2," Defendants ask that some of their proposed facts which plaintiffs dispute be admitted, arguing that plaintiffs failed to properly 
respond to them. As defendants note, HN1[
] ""a proper 56.1 statement submitted by a non-movant should consist of a 
paragraph-by-paragraph response to the movant's 56.1 statement, much like an answer to a complaint."" Rodriguez v. 
Schneider, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9741, 1999 WL 459813, at *1 n. 3 (S.D.N.Y. June 29, 1999). Plaintiffs did provide a 
paragraph-by-paragraph response to defendants' 56.1 statement. However, some of those responses referred generally to an 
""affirmative statement"" for the grounds of dispute. In particular, plaintiffs assert no less than sixteen times, without any citation to 
specific facts, that ""in light of the material facts discussed [in Plaintiffs' affirmative statement] there exists a genuine issue to be 
tried as to whether Coumadin(R) competes in the same market as generic warfarin sodium."" The Court did not impermissibly 
have ""to scour the record on its own in a search for evidence which may support that party's contention that a certain fact is in 
dispute."" Id. However, plaintiffs' statement did require scouring the affirmative statement to determine which parts of it supported 
plaintiffs' contention that a triable issue exists as to whether Coumadin(R) competes in the same market as generic warfarin 
sodium. Because of this, the Court will accept the facts submitted by the defendants to which plaintiffs responded by referring generally 
to its later affirmative statement. This does not mean that the Court ignored the affirmative statement, and facts from the 
affirmative statement are included in the statement of facts below. It does mean that the Court will not sift through an affirmative 
statement to make a party's arguments for it -- particularly in a complex case such as this one where both parties are ably 
represented and have demonstrated the ability to brief, in hundreds of pages, the issues. In any case, plaintiffs fail to present a 
genuine issue to be tried as to whether Coumadin competes in the same market as generic warfarin sodium. "
1308,3," Invamed, however, has a longstanding policy of including two sources if possible."
1308,4," Plaintiffs state that other differences exist between branded and generic drugs, but do not allege that this differences 
necessarily exist between generic and branded warfarin sodium. These differences are: (1) consumers and doctors may not 
view the generic product as interchangeable with the branded product; (2) lower price; and (3) the principal customers for 
pharmaceutical drugs -- large chain drug stores and distributors -- tend to stock the branded product and only one generic 
product for any particular pharmaceutical. "
1310,5," By the time these discussions took place, ACIC had supplied samples and/or a DMF reference letter to Diosynth, Invamed, 
Mylan, Par Pharmaceutical Inc., and Taro. "
1313,6," It was ACIC's practice to supply samples and technical information packages free of charge to any customer that asked for 
one. These packages included samples, certificates of analysis, impurities data, stability data, specifications, test methods and 
safety information, and a schematic flowchart of the synthetic process. At times, the packages included a DMF reference letter. It 
was Invamed's practice to request a full technical package from numerous API suppliers."
1313,7," These included: (1) a DMF referral letter (in triplicate) and any amendments to the original DMF referral letter from ACIC; (2) 
three additional lots of samples (minimum 50g each) with corresponding certificates of analysis; (3) a complete technical 
package including a synthesis flow chart, identification of major impurities and synthesis precursors and an impurity standard 
sample with a certificate of analysis; and (4) Certificate of Analysis, impurities data and particle size for the 15 kilogram 
shipment. "
1314,8," On July 31, 1996, Calenti sold the remaining 25% of ACIC company to Apotex Pharmaceutical Holdings Inc. In connection with 
the transaction, ACIC changed its name to Brantford Chemicals Inc. (""Brantford"") and continued the manufacturing and research 
side of the business under Apotex's management. Calenti formed a new company, ACIC Fine Chemicals, Inc. (""ACIC Fine 
Chemicals"") which, under Calenti's leadership, pursued the sales and agency side of the business. ACIC Fine Chemicals served 
as an exclusive sales representative for certain Brantford products. "
1315,9," Defendants allege that Patel and other principals in Invamed personally invested in Banyan, but plaintiffs deny this connection. 
Invamed did state that Banyan was vertically integrated with it. "
1318,10," Hoechst sold its Coventry facility and its clathrate business to Napp Technologies, Inc. (""Napp"") in 1998. Napp provided 
clathrate to Invamed in June 1998."
1318,11," Plaintiffs claim that this agreement constituted a joint venture. They note that they referred to the agreement as a ""joint 
venture"" and ""partnership,"" and they shared losses. Plaintiffs do not allege that they shared any joint ownership, however. "
1320,12," Although it was not Patel's practice to send purchase orders by certified mail, he sent the October 1, 1997 purchase order by 
certified mail because he believed Brantford had a history of ""playing games"" with Invamed and because he was concerned that 
Brantford would be evasive in acknowledging its receipt."
1320,13," Brantford operates a multi-purpose facility that manufactures many different chemical products. It is in operation 24 hours a 
day, seven days a week. Brantford manufactures API in campaigns. A ""campaign"" means the completion of the various steps for 
a series of batches of the API within a given period of time. Campaigns avoid inefficiencies (such as equipment cleaning and "
1321,," validation) that result from changing the facility over from manufacturing one API to another. Brantford schedules campaigns 
based on requirements that have been identified by customers as well as lead times for the raw materials required for 
production. "
1324,14," Barr, among other things, utilized direct mailings, physician panels, journal advertising in both trade and medical publications, 
trade show seminar booths, telemarketing, and continuing education courses involving live panelists of pharmacists. Barr also 
implemented a toll-free ""Warfarin Hotline"" available to patients, physicians, and other care givers. "
1326,15," Many courts today avoid the term ""submarkets"" as potentially confusing. E.g.,  Allen-Myland, Inc. v. Int'l Business Machines 
Corp., 33 F.3d 194, 208 n.16 (3d Cir. 1994).; FTC v. Staples, Inc., 970 F. Supp. 1066, 1080 n.11 (D.D.C. 1997) (""Whatever term 
is used - market, submarket, relevant product market - the analysis is the same.""). "
1327,16, The defendants aver that the prices remained the same for months before and after the plaintiff's entry into the market. 
1329,17," The issue of whether Barr controls ACIC/Brantford will also reappear, infra, in a discussion of whether Barr and 
ACIC/Brantford legally are capable of conspiring. In that context, plaintiffs argue that Barr -- through its common shareholder, 
Sherman -- does not exert control over ACIC/Brantford. "
1330,18," Invamed refused to enter into the contract because it would not commit to Hoechst as its sole supplier, although it did attempt 
to create a one-sided long-term agreement whereby Hoechst would only supply to Invamed. "
1332,19," This Court previously dismissed Invamed's Sherman Act conspiracy claims as to all defendants except Barr and Brantford, 
which did not move to dismiss. Invamed, 22 F. Supp.2d at 220-22. Invamed failed to allege, inter alia, that ""there was concerted 
action between any of the defendants . . . ."" Id. at 221. "
1334,20," In any case, HN25[
] absence of any prospect for success of the alleged § 2 conspiracy precludes a finding that the requisite intent existed. Hudson Valley Asbestos Corp. v. Tougher Heating & Plumbing Co., 510 F.2d 1140 (2d Cir. 1975); Apex Oil Co. v. 
Dimauro, 713 F. Supp. 587, 600 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (granting summary judgment on conspiracy to monopolize claim where ""the 
alleged activities of the . . . defendants, both intended and completed, . . . could not amount to § 2 monopolization""). As 
discussed above, Barr's share of the relevant product market -- that consisting of generic and branded warfarin sodium -- was 
low. In addition, because of actual and potential entry into the market, it was and is incapable of attaining or maintaining 
monopoly power. "
1335,21," E.g.,  Arbitron Co. v. Tropicana Product Sales Inc., 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5587, 1993 WL 138965 (S.D.N.Y. April 28, 1993) 
(holding that § 7 does not apply to seller of stock or assets). But see  United States v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los Angeles, 
575 F.2d 222, 230-31 (9th Cir. 1978) (holding that seller may be joined in § 7 action where plaintiff seeks rescission and court 
needs jurisdiction over seller in order to effectuate such equitable relief). "
1336,22," Even if a joint venture exists, Apothecon could not sue individually, but only for the injury to the joint venture. E.g.,  Int'l 
Television Prods. v. Twentieth Century Fox, 622 F. Supp. 1532, 1536 (S.D.N.Y. 1985) (HN29[
] claims belong to joint venture 
and not to entities making up venture in their individual capacities)."
1336,23," The agreement also refers to ""an earlier agreement dated December 22, 1995 for the manufacture and distribution of certain 
products."""
1336,24," HN31[
] Under New Jersey law, a joint venture may still be formed in the absence of an express statement that it is a joint 
venture. E.g.,  Ditscher v. Booth, 13 N.J. Super. 568, 572, 80 A.2d 648, 650 (Super. Ct. Ch. Div. 1951) (contract ""need contain 
no particular form or expression"")."
1336,25," Apothecon's complaint listed several additional state law counts that were not included in Invamed's complaint. These include 
Count VIII (fraud against ACIC/Brantford and Barr); Count XIV (breach of fiduciary duty against Barr); and Count XV (unfair 
competition against Barr). These are all dismissed and will not be discussed below. "
1337,26," Because the alleged sales contract involves international trade, Invamed's claims must be analyzed according to the 
provisions of HN34[
] the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods (""CISG""). 15 U.S.C. App. 2. The CISG 
is an international treaty that embodies a uniform set of rules for the creation of a contract of sale and the related obligations of 
parties to international sales transactions. Id. To the extent that the CISG reserves issues for the application of domestic law, 
New Jersey law applies, as discussed infra."
1337,27," Defendants point out that Invamed acted inconsistently with the alleged ""industry custom,"" and Invamed concedes that at least 
in 1995 it did not adhere to this ""industry custom"" in dealing with ACIC and Invamed's other suppliers. Dave testified that 
Invamed's standard practice in dealing with ACIC and most suppliers was to discuss Invamed's interest in placing an order for a 
specific quantity and then to reach an agreement on terms (price, quantity, delivery dates, payment terms) before submitting a 
purchase order. This failure to conform to what they allege is industry custom is insufficient to disprove, as a matter of law, that 
there was not an industry custom to this effect in 1997 and that Invamed relied on it in 1997. It remains an issue of fact as to 
whether Invamed's general behavior in 1995 carried over to 1997, when it submitted a purchase order without contacting 
ACIC/Brantford and without first agreeing to terms. "
1338,28," Defendants suggest that the offer fails because it did not specify a delivery date. HN38[
] Depending on the circumstances, 
additional terms such as delivery dates may be required for an offer. CISG, Commentary 105-06 (Schlecteriem, ed.) (2d ed. 
1998) (hereinafter ""Commentary""). Defendants state that Invamed discussed delivery dates with its API suppliers as a matter of 
practice, and that delivery dates are important to the supplier because it needs to plan its production schedule to meet customer 
requirements. Invamed disputes that it discussed delivery dates with its API suppliers as a matter of practice. Thus, this issue 
cannot be decided as a matter of law. "
1339,29," Although this Court decided earlier that Invamed was not ""locked in"" as a matter of antitrust law, it is nonetheless arguable 
that the resulting delay and cost in changing suppliers practically meant that Invamed would buy from ACIC/Brantford even if it 
were not required to do so. This is sufficient to establish consideration, even though it is not sufficient as a matter of law to 
present a Kodak lock-in situation. "
1341,30," HN50[
] Just because a party labels a cause of action a ""tort"" does not mean that it is automatically not pre-empted by the 
CISG. A tort that is in actuality a contract claim, or that bridges the gap between contract and tort law may very well be pre-
empted. Schlechtriem, supra, at 474."
1341,31," This holding is limited to promissory estoppel as claimed by Invamed. Other promissory estoppel claims, such as that 
discussed above, could be preempted. "

on this analysis is on the parties' domiciles and the locus of the tort. Aro Chem. Inter., Inc. v. Buirkle, 968 F.2d 266, 270 (2d Cir. 
1992). In the context of conduct regulating torts such as those asserted by Invamed, the law of the place of the wrong governs.  
La Luna Enters. Inc. v. CBS Corp., 74 F. Supp.2d 384, 389 (S.D.N.Y. 1999). In this case, the place of the wrong is where the 
injury occurred, New Jersey. Id.;  Rosenberg v. Pillsbury Co., 718 F. Supp. 1146, 1150 (S.D.N.Y. 1989). "
1351,1," Marnie Zien, a third-year student at Tulane Law School, assisted in the researching and drafting of this Order and Reasons. "
1352,2," Section 3 of the FAA is entitled ""Stay of proceedings where issue therein referable to arbitration"" and states as follows: HN4[
] If any suit or proceeding be brought in any of the courts of the United States upon any issue referable to arbitration 
under an agreement in writing for such arbitration, the court in which such suit is pending, upon being satisfied that the 
issue involved in such suit or proceeding is referable to arbitration under such an agreement, shall on application of one of 
the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement, 
providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration. (emphasis added). "
1353,3, The parties do not dispute the validity of the arbitration agreements themselves.
1353,4," This document is dated May 23, 1997, and was executed by ATMi, Diebold and Diebold Credit. See id."
1353,5," This agreement is dated May 23, 1997, and was executed by ATMi and Diebold. See id."

1353,8," In its Supplemental Memorandum, Diebold contends that paragraph 16 of the Master Lease/Purchase Agreement--which 
provides that ""lessee hereby waives any right to demand a jury trial . . . in connection with this lease""-is part of the arbitration 
agreement. As the Court finds that arbitration is provided for elsewhere in the Master Lease/Purchase Agreement, it is 
unnecessary to determine the impact of paragraph 16 upon the arbitrability of the claims here. "
1354,9," The Court does not need to determine the scope of the Program Product License Agreement arbitration clause because ATMi's 
claims do not, in any manner, relate to that Agreement. "

1367,1," USTC also points out that in 1996, Wal-Mart asked it and other moist snuff manufacturers to design a rack for the store to use 
for its moist snuff products. (J.A. at 492.) Conwood decided not to participate in the contest. Id. USTC's design won. Id. Swisher 
also won similar competitions for exclusive rack systems in K-Mart and Tom Thumb stores. (J.A. at 2859, 518-19, 1447-48.) "
1373,2," HN9[
] Whether a company has monopoly or market power ""may be proven directly by evidence of the control of prices or the 
exclusion of competition, or it may be inferred from one firm's large percentage share of the relevant market."" Tops Market, 142 
F.3d at 97-98 (citation omitted); see also  Re/Max, 173 F.3d at 1016 (citation omitted). ""The material consideration in 
determining whether a monopoly exists is not that prices are raised and that competition is excluded, but that power exists to 
raise prices or to exclude competition when it is desired to do so."" Byars, 609 F.2d 843, 850 (citations omitted). Courts have 
increasingly leaned toward using circumstantial evidence as a shortcut to determine whether monopoly power exists.  Re/Max, 
173 F.3d at 1016. Such circumstantial evidence may encompass a high market share within a defined market.  Id. at 1018. At 
trial there was evidence that USTC enjoyed 74 to 77 percent market power nationwide in the moist snuff industry. As previously 
stated, USTC neither challenges this finding nor argues that it does not possess monopoly power. To that end, we agree with 
USTC that the monopolization and attempt to monopolize claims are coterminous inasmuch as USTC concedes monopoly 
power. See  Northeastern Tel. Co. v. American Tel. and Tel. Co., 651 F.2d 76, 85 (2d Cir. 1981) (explaining that where ability to 
exclude entry and control prices is present, the two offenses are coterminous). "
1375,3," USTC complains that Conwood was allowed to rely on numerous hearsay documents that detailed conduct that is routinely 
rejected as not being very probative of anti-competitive intent and that showed nothing more than statements about competitive 
objectives. However, HN13[
] experts are entitled to rely on documents, even hearsay documents that are otherwise 
inadmissible.  Kingsley Associates, Inc. v. Del-Met, Inc., 918 F.2d 1277, 1286-87 (6th Cir. 1990) (holding that Federal Rules 
allow experts to base their opinions on hearsay and other evidence otherwise inadmissible at trial). "
1376,4," To the extent that USTC complains that evidence of its unlawful anti-competitive conduct, and its lawful conduct to take 
advantage of scale of economies, offer category management services or engage in other promotional activity in general were 
commingled, the district court properly instructed the jury that USTC could not be held liable for conduct that was part of the 
normal competitive process. The jury is deemed to have followed these instructions.  Aspen, 472 U.S. at 604-05. In addition to 
that argument, USTC also contends that Conwood has failed to show that its practices foreclosed competition. It further 
contends that its exclusive dealing arrangements with retailers cannot be invalid, absent a ""particularized showing of 
unreasonableness."" See. e.g.,  Tri-State Rubbish, Inc. v. Waste Mgmt., Inc., 998 F.2d 1073, 1080 (1st Cir. 1993) (explaining that 
a complaint that alleges, inter alia, no more than exclusive dealing arrangements may be susceptible to dismissal for failure to 
state a claim). However, Conwood's claim is broader than merely challenging the exclusive agreements USTC entered into with 
retailers for exclusive racks. As explained in the text of this opinion, among other things, Conwood presented evidence that 
USTC pervasively destroyed Conwood's racks, and used its monopoly power to misrepresent sales activity of moist snuff 
products for purposes of obtaining exclusive racks and to bury competitors' products therein, all of which affected competition in 
the moist snuff market. Moreover, Conwood's claims are distinguishable from those asserted in several of the cases USTC cites, 
wherein plaintiffs alleged that exclusive arrangements violated § 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 14 or other sections of the 
antitrust statutes. See e.g.,  Omega Envtl., Inc. v. Gilbarco, Inc., 127 F.3d 1157, 1162 (9th Cir. 1997) (holding that ""only those 
arrangements whose 'probable' effect is to 'foreclose competition in a substantial share of the line of commerce affected' violate 
Section 3""). "
1379,5," However, apparently for the first time on appeal, USTC argues that Leftwich's regression model cannot be tested, is not subject 
to ascertainable rate of error and has no basis in the literature. These arguments were not raised below and may not be "
1380,," asserted now on appeal. See  White v. Anchor Motor Freight, Inc., 899 F.2d 555, 559 (6th Cir. 1990) (noting that HN20[
] this 
Court reviews the case presented to the district court, and not a better one fashioned on appeal, and will not decide issues the 
parties failed to litigate before the district court)."
1380,6," Fed. R. Evid. 403 provides: ""Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by 
the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, 
or needless presentation of cumulative evidence."""
1380,7," We also note that even if USTC had failed to adequately preserve this issue, we would still review it for plain error, and USTC 
would only be entitled to relief if we determined that its ""substantial rights"" had been affected.  Brawner, 173 F.3d at 970 
(citations omitted). Regardless of whether we review the issue for plain error or for abuse of discretion, as we explain in the text 
of this opinion, we believe that the district court did not err in allowing Leftwich to testify regarding the damages Conwood 
sustained. "
1381,8," ""The before and after theory compares the plaintiff's profit record prior to the violation with that subsequent to it [and] the 
yardstick test . . . consists of a study of the profits of business operations that are closely comparable to the plaintiff's."" Eleven 
Line, Inc., 213 F.3d at 207 n.17. A regression analysis looks at the relationship between two variables.  Rollins v. Fort Bend 
Independent School Dist., 89 F.3d 1205, 1210 n.6 (5th Cir. 1996). The point of a regression analysis is to determine whether the 
relationship between the two variables is statistically meaningful.  Engineering Contractors Ass'n of South Florida Inc. v. 
Metropolitan Dade County, 122 F.3d 895, 917 (11th Cir. 1997). "
1387,1, We note that all statutory references are to the 1999-2000 version unless otherwise indicated.
1387,2," We note that the parties dispute whether the agreement granted the District capacity or access in the City's interceptors. 
Although the circuit court found that the agreement granted access to the District, we need not resolve this factual dispute on 
appeal as it is not germane to the outcome. "
1388,3, The commission is not a party to this action.
1388,4," The District additionally argues that the City failed to establish its additional defense based on claim or issue preclusion. 
Although the District asserted this defense in the circuit court, the circuit court did not grant summary judgment on this basis. Nor 
does the City renew this issue on appeal. Therefore, the issue is not before us. "
1389,5," The District additionally cites to Section 604 of the 1982 agreement which prohibits a contracting municipality from making or 
permitting any new connection to or extension of its local sewer system which is designed or permits entrance of inflow into the 
regional system without first submitting plans to the commission and to a provision requiring payment for the use of the local 
sewer system. We summarily reject these additional arguments. These provisions do not conflict with the City's authority under 
Section 401 to withhold consent. "
1390,6, The District cites to a letter from the City's attorney in support of this argument. 
1391,7," Both of these statutory sections have since been renumbered.  Wisconsin Stat. § 66.069(2)(c) (1979-80) was renumbered to 
Wis. Stat. § 66.0813(3)(a) (1999-2000) by 1999 Wis. Act 150, §§ 189, 240. The language of the statute has remained 
substantially the same as that considered by the court in Town of Hallie v. City of Chippewa Falls, 105 Wis. 2d 533, 314 
N.W.2d 321 (1982). It provides: Notwithstanding s. 196.58(5), a city, village or town may by ordinance fix the limits of utility service in incorporated areas. 
The ordinance shall delineate the area within which service will be provided and the municipal utility has no obligation to 
serve beyond the delineated area. The delineated area may be enlarged by a subsequent ordinance. No ordinance under 
this paragraph is effective to limit any obligation to serve that existed at the time that the ordinance was adopted. Sec. 66.0813(3)(a). Wisconsin Stat. § 144.07(1m) (1979-80) was renumbered to Wis. Stat. § 281.43(1m) (1999-2000) by 1995 Wis. Act 227 § 408. 
Again, the language of the statute is substantively the same as that considered by the court in Town of Hallie. It provides: (1m) An order by the department for the connection of unincorporated territory to a city or village system or plant under this 
section shall not become effective for 30 days following issuance. Within 30 days following issuance of the order, the 
governing body of a city or village subject to an order under this section may commence an annexation proceeding under s. 
66.0219 to annex the unincorporated territory subject to the order. If the result of the referendum under s. 66.0219(4) is in 
favor of annexation, the territory shall be annexed to the city or village for all purposes, and sewerage service shall be 
extended to the territory subject to the order. If an application for an annexation referendum is denied under s. 66.029(2) or 
the referendum under s. 66.0219(4) is against the annexation, the order shall be void. If an annexation proceeding is not 
commenced within the 30-day period, the order shall become effective. Sec. 281.43(1m). "
1392,8," The supreme court's ruling in Town of Hallie was later supported by the United States Supreme Court's holding in Town of 
Hallie v. City of Eau Claire, 471 U.S. 34, 85 L. Ed. 2d 24, 105 S. Ct. 1713 (1985). In that case, four unincorporated townships 
located adjacent to the City of Eau Claire sought injunctive relief against the city.  Id. at 36. The townships claimed that the City 
violated the Sherman Act by acquiring a monopoly over the provision of sewage treatment services in Eau Claire and Chippewa 
counties and by tying the provision of such services to the provision of sewage collection and transportation services.  Id. at 36-
37. The Supreme Court rejected the township's arguments holding that the State of Wisconsin ""has specifically authorized 
Wisconsin cities to provide sewage services and has delegated to the cities the express authority to take action that foreseeably 
will result in anticompetitive effects."" Id. at 43. It concluded that ""the Wisconsin statutes evidence a 'clearly articulated and 
affirmatively expressed' state policy to displace competition with regulation in the area of municipal provision of sewage 
services."" Id. at 44 (citation omitted). We note that a later federal case, Sakamoto v. Duty Free Shoppers, Ltd., 764 F.2d 1285, 1288 (9th Cir. 1985), indicates that 
much of the force of the United States Supreme court cases such as Town of Hallie v. City of Eau Claire, which hold that 
municipalities are not immune from antitrust liability unless acting pursuant to a clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed 
state policy to displace competition, have been prospectively overruled with the enactmant of the Local Government Antitrust Act 
of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-544, 98 Stat. 2750 (1984). The effect of this act on the issues on appeal has not been raised by the 
parties and is not addressed in this decision. "
1409,1," The initial complaint also asserted claims under Michigan antitrust law, but these claims were omitted from Plaintiff's more 
recent amended complaints."
1409,2," Defendant ARC filed a separate motion for summary judgment on November 15, 2000. The Court orally granted this motion at 
the November 14 hearing, and will issue a separate Opinion and Order setting forth the grounds for this ruling."
1409,3," Tellingly, Plaintiffs did not even attempt to state the facts of their case within the confines of the 50-page briefing limit 
established by stipulation of the parties, but instead submitted a separate ""Factual Appendix"" that includes 267 numbered 
paragraphs and spans 169 pages. "
1410,4," To be completely accurate, Plaintiffs and their experts have identified 246 city-pair routes as the relevant markets for their 
antitrust claims. However, 12 of these routes are double-counted, as they involve travel between two Defendants' hub airports. It 
also should be noted that these 246 routes do not exhaust all, or even most, of the cities served by the Defendant Airlines from 
their hub airports. However, Plaintiffs' experts have excluded various city-pairs from their analysis, including (i) ""short haul"" 
routes of less than 150 miles, where ground transportation could readily serve as a substitute for air travel; (ii) low-travel routes, 
involving fewer than 30,000 round-trip passengers per year, as such low volumes likely could support only one airline, and 
thereby create ""natural monopoly"" situations; and (iii) routes on which the Defendant hub carrier holds less than a 50-percent 
market share, under the reasoning that it would be more difficult to establish monopoly power on such routes. (See Plaintiffs' 
Exhibits, Tab 71, Beyer Expert Report at 24-25.)"
1410,5," More specifically, Plaintiffs propose a single ""injunctive class"" for all such passengers, a single ""damages class"" of all such 
passengers for purposes of their Section 1 antitrust conspiracy claim, and three separate ""damage classes"" of customers of 
each individual Defendant Airline for purposes of their Section 2 antitrust claims."
1410,6," As indicated in the Court's prior published opinion in this case, these fares were the ones in effect on September 29, 1995. See  
Chase, 49 F. Supp.2d at 557 n.7. "
1411,7," The parties also occasionally refer to the practice of ""back-to-back"" ticketing, which involves the purchase of two round-trip 
tickets for travel in opposite directions -- for example, New York/Detroit and Detroit/New York -- and permits the purchaser to 
avoid the premium charged for travel that does not satisfy a minimum-stay requirement. For example, if a business traveler 
wished to make a round trip between New York and Detroit on two consecutive midweek days, thereby failing to qualify for a 
less expensive fare involving a Saturday stayover, he might discover that it is cheaper to purchase two discounted round-trip 
tickets, each including a Saturday stayover, and to use only the first legs of these two tickets to form a composite midweek 
round-trip ticket, rather than purchasing a single, much more expensive round-trip ticket that reflected his actual travel plans. 
The practice of back-to-back ticketing, though sometimes relevant to the arguments made by the parties, is not directly at issue 
in this case."
1411,8, U.S. Airways' version of this rule was designated Rule 150. 
1412,9," ATC was a division of the Air Transport Association (""ATA""), a trade group of 22 passenger airlines (including all three of the 
Defendant Airlines). "
1414,10," Plaintiffs further assert that, in moving from a discussion of international fare-related issues to U.S. fare-related concerns, even 
if only at IATA meetings, the airlines crossed the line from permissible conduct to impermissible antitrust violations. In support of 
this proposition, they cite the testimony of Michael Levine, Northwest's former head of marketing and pricing, that the airlines' 
antitrust immunity extended only to discussions of international pricing issues at IATA meetings, and not to any discussions of 
matters relating to domestic pricing or fares. In particular, Levine testified that ""the discussion of domestic tariff abuse would not 
have been, in my judgment, immunized by and therefore would have been exposed in an IATA meeting."" (Plaintiffs' Exhibits, 
Tab 90, Levine Dep. at 593.)"
1414,11," Other such fraud prevention seminars were held in 1993, 1994, and 1995. Hawes made another presentation at the 1993 
seminar, in which he again made many of the same points. At the 1994 seminar, United Airlines' head of corporate security, Ken 
Gilbart, gave a presentation on ""tariff abuse"" in which he addressed hidden-city ticketing. The participants have confirmed that 
hidden-city ticketing also was discussed at a workshop during the 1995 seminar. "
1415,12," Plaintiffs note that, shortly after this memo was sent, Delta reorganized its corporate security department and began, for the 
first time, to address the general issue of ""loss prevention."" However, the record does not support Plaintiffs' further suggestion 
that this loss prevention program was directed in part at the practice of hidden-city ticketing. To the contrary, Delta's security 
personnel, when questioned at their depositions, did not seem particularly familiar with the practice of hidden-city ticketing, nor 
did they state that the 1992 reorganization of Delta's corporate security department encompassed any particular effort to deter 
hidden-city ticketing. "
1416,13," In May of 1992, Northwest licensed the PRA system to Andersen, which in turn began to license and market the software to 
other airlines through a wholly-owned subsidiary called PRA Solutions. PRA Solutions formed an advisory board, consisting of 
one representative from each airline which had purchased a software update service. "
1417,14," The proposal apparently was never formally voted upon, but was merely tabled, for reasons that do not appear in the record."
1417,15," As noted earlier, Plaintiffs and their experts have identified seven hub airports and 234 city-pairs upon which their claims in 
this case are based. Their § 2 claims, however, exclude certain of these city-pairs that involve routes between two airlines' hub 
airports."
1417,16," Defendants previously filed a motion to exclude the proposed testimony of Plaintiffs' experts as failing to satisfy the standards 
of Fed. R. Evid. 702. In a recently issued Opinion and Order, the Court rejected this challenge, finding that Plaintiffs' expert 
testimony satisfied the Court's gatekeeping inquiry under Rule 702, at least under the present evidentiary record. As discussed "
1418,," below, this ruling somewhat foretells the defeat of several of the Airlines' present arguments in support of their motion for 
summary judgment and in opposition to Plaintiffs' motion for class certification."
1418,17," ""Taken together, these three cases signal to the lower courts that summary judgment can be relied upon more so than in the 
past to weed out frivolous lawsuits and avoid wasteful trials."" 10A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary K. Kane, Federal 
Practice & Procedure, § 2727, at 468 (1998) (footnote omitted). "
1422,18," Indeed, Plaintiffs point to evidence that the airlines have not always treated the practice of hidden-city ticketing as ""fraud,"" but 
that, to the contrary, some airlines publicly encouraged the practice in the past, and taught travel agents how to write such 
tickets at industry seminars. It would be difficult to establish the requisite ""intent to deceive"" where the purportedly injured party 
has propagated different views of what it considers ""deception."" "
1423,19," Notably, the converse is not necessarily true -- i.e., even if one Airline could act unilaterally against hidden-city ticketing, it 
does not necessarily follow that the Airlines collectively could agree to do so. "
1424,20," By way of contrast, the practice of ""back-to-back"" ticketing might require cooperative preventative measures, because the two 
tickets purchased to accomplish this result can be from two different airlines, so long as both fly between the passenger's point 
of origin and destination. "
1426,21," Interestingly, by distinguishing between hub-to-hub and other routes, Defendants seemingly have accepted the premise that 
each Airline is largely free to act as it pleases on hub-spoke routes involving its own hubs, without any concern about potential 
competition from other airlines. Yet, in their challenge to Plaintiffs' § 2 claim, Defendants deny that they have such competitive 
control on routes involving their hubs."
1426,22," This assumes an ""all-or-nothing"" approach to the prevention of hidden-city ticketing. Both Plaintiffs and Defendants seem to 
operate under this assumption, and the Airlines' tariff rules include such a blanket proscription. Apart from technical difficulties in 
implementation, however, there would seem to be no reason why an airline could not choose to prohibit hidden-city ticketing on 
hub-spoke routes, but allow it on routes between its and another carrier's hubs. And, so long as airlines are free to make this 
choice, this option seemingly would have to be factored into any determination of an airline's economically ""optimal"" response to 
the practice of hidden-city ticketing."
1426,23," In addition, Defendants chide Plaintiffs for their ""failure to offer evidence that any of the three defendant airlines ever weighed 
its potential common hub-hub revenue losses against its total [hidden-city] losses."" (Defendants' Reply Br. at 15.) This lack of 
evidence, however, strikes the Court as the proverbial ""dog that didn't bark."" According to Defendants, each Airline 
independently concluded that its own self-interest favored a prohibition on hidden-city ticketing, and that competitive concerns 
did not dictate otherwise. (See id. at 13, 15.) To reach such a conclusion, each Airline presumably would have needed to 
perform some sort of cost/benefit analysis, under the assumption that the Airline might lose at least some of its customers to 
competitors that elected not to adopt such a prohibition. Yet, if each Airline were confident that the other Airlines would also 
prohibit this practice, no such analysis would be necessary. As noted, there is no evidence in the record of any such analysis 
having been undertaken. "
1427,24," Moreover, while Plaintiffs offer evidence that the airlines reached a different conclusion regarding back-to-back ticketing, 
determining that unilateral efforts would not be effective and that group concurrence was needed, Defendants correctly observe 
that back-to-back ticketing is not at issue in this case, and that hidden-city and back-to-back ticketing raise wholly different 
competitive concerns."
1427,25," For example, according to Dr. Beyer, Defendant Northwest realized additional revenues of approximately $ 534 million in the 
period from 1992 to 1999 as a result of its hidden-city prohibition, but collected revenues of approximately $ 3.02 billion in that 
same time period from business passengers traveling on hub-to-hub routes. "
1428,26," In any event, the Court believes that Defendants have overstated the degree of variance in the Airlines' approaches to hidden-
city ticketing. Counsel asserted at the November 14 hearing, for example, that Defendant Delta ""is no longer enforcing"" its 
hidden-city prohibition. (11/14/01 Hearing Tr. at 70.) Yet, it was quickly conceded that ""everybody,"" including Delta, automatically 
cancels the remainder of a passenger's itinerary if the passenger fails to travel one of its segments. (Id. at 71.) As the Court 
observed at the hearing, this clearly is an enforcement mechanism that strongly discourages the purchase of hidden-city tickets."
1428,27," Indeed, to obtain protection under the rule of Cement Manufacturers, Defendants arguably must go further, and establish that, 
to the extent that they shared information and communicated among themselves regarding hidden-city ticketing, they did so for 
the purpose of preventing fraud. "
1432,28," Each airline was given a supply of ""medallions"" that it could provide to select passengers -- typically, first-class, business-
class, and full coach fare passengers -- whose baggage was then exempt from the template limitation. "
1433,29," Indeed, there is an inherent tension between Plaintiffs' § 1 and § 2 claims on this point, where Plaintiffs have alleged, in 
support of their § 2 claims, that each Airline's hidden-city prohibition is an instrumental part of that Airline's own monopolistic 
strategy to impose ""hub premiums"" on its hub-spoke passengers. This seemingly would provide a motive -- albeit an unlawful 
one -- for each Airline to continue its prohibition, even in the absence of an agreement to do so. "
1434,30," Moreover, for the reasons discussed earlier, the Court does not find itself compelled as a matter of law to accept Defendants' 
""fraud prevention"" justification for such an agreement."
1434,31," Nor does the record cast light on any other available, less restrictive alternatives to a blanket prohibition against hidden-city 
ticketing. Cf.  Continental, 277 F.3d at 509 (noting that a full Rule of Reason analysis requires the examination of alternatives). 
An Airline might, for example, refuse to award frequent flier miles or withhold other perks where it detects that a passenger has 
used a hidden-city ticket. "
1436,32," As explained in the earlier Opinion, ""interbrand competition is the competition among the manufacturers of the same generic 
product,"" while ""intrabrand competition is the competition between the distributors -- wholesale or retail -- of the product of a 
particular manufacturer."" Chase, 49 F. Supp.2d at 566 n.20 (quoting Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 52 
n.19, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 2558 n.19, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977)). "
1437,33," In any event, to the extent that Dr. Beyer's testimony is viewed as expressing a legal conclusion as to what constitutes 
actionable ""exclusionary conduct"" under § 2, such an opinion cannot overcome the Court's duty to say what the law is. "
1438,34," As noted earlier, HN22[
] a horizontal restraint entails action by competitors at the same market level. In this case, for example, Plaintiffs' § 1 claim rests upon allegations of a horizontal agreement among the Airlines to deter the practice of hidden-
city ticketing. In contrast, a vertical restraint operates in the distribution chain between supplier and customer -- in this case, an 
Airline and its passengers. Given the vertical nature of an individual Airline's hidden-city prohibition, Defendants' protestations 
that the Airlines and travel agents do not compete in the relevant market -- namely, passenger air travel service -- are utterly 
unremarkable and lack legal significance. Likewise, because Plaintiffs here are not ""jilted distributors,"" and do not otherwise 
claim that they have been excluded from the relevant market, Defendants' various citations to antitrust cases in which a plaintiff 
failed to show that it competed with the defendant in a relevant market, see, e.g.,  Intergraph Corp. v. Intel Corp., 195 F.3d 1346, 
1353-55 (Fed. Cir. 1999); Ad-Vantage Telephone Directory Consultants, Inc. v. GTE Directories Corp., 849 F.2d 1336, 1348 
(11th Cir. 1987), are simply inapposite. Much as Defendants might prefer that Plaintiffs' § 2 claims rested on a fundamentally 
flawed view of the marketplace, Plaintiffs have stubbornly refused to cast their claims in such terms. Any legal defects in these 
claims lie well below the surface, and will not be disclosed through Defendants' superficial apples-to-oranges comparisons."
1438,35," Plaintiffs' only other argument on this point is that hidden-city prohibitions have interbrand as well as intrabrand effects, in light 
of the Airlines' alleged collective adoption of these prohibitions. Yet, this contention inappropriately elides the distinction between 
Plaintiffs' § 1 and § 2 claims. If there were such an agreement among the Airlines to prohibit hidden-city ticketing, then Plaintiffs' 
§ 2 claims would be mere surplusage, as all of the relief they seek could be obtained through their § 1 claim. If their § 2 claim 
adds anything, then, it can only be in the event that each Airline's separate hidden-city prohibition is found to be an 
anticompetitive exercise of its own alleged monopoly power, without regard for what the other Airlines might be doing with 
respect to this practice. For present purposes, then, the Court believes it appropriate to view each Airline's conduct in isolation. "
1441,36," While some courts have required a showing that the defendant either attained or attempted to attain a monopoly in the 
leveraged market, see, e.g.,  Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. United Airlines, Inc., 948 F.2d 536, 547 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 503 
U.S. 977, 118 L. Ed. 2d 316, 112 S. Ct. 1603 (1992), the Sixth Circuit declined to adopt this standard in Kerasotes, stating: We expressly reject the district court's reasoning that leverage or the abuse of monopoly power is not actionable when the 
offender has not yet acquired a dominant position in the affected market . . . . HN29[
] Products that may be inferior 
should not be allowed to prosper in a particular market as a result of [their] producer's exploitation of its monopoly position 
in a second market. Under such situations, potential economic or competitive gains are not identifiable. This is, of course, 
most clearly so where the alleged offender has used coercion in the market where it validly possesses monopoly power to 
further extend that power to a second market. Finally, we observe that the antitrust laws prohibit not just the possession of 
monopoly power but also attempts to restrain trade and impede competition. Thus, it is not determinative that [the 
defendant] may not presently enjoy a dominant market power position in . . . the affected market. Kerasotes, 854 F.2d at 137-38. "
1442,37," ""Price discrimination occurs when a firm obtains different rates of return from different groups of customers."" III Phillip E. 
Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, P 721a, at 262 (2d ed. 2002)."
1442,38," In its earlier Opinion addressing the proposed testimony of Plaintiffs' experts, the Court expressed serious reservations about 
the use of hidden-city fares as a measure of the purported hub premiums imposed by the Airlines on their hub-spoke 
passengers. Nevertheless, the Court found that the experts' testimony on this point satisfied the threshold standards for 
admissibility under Fed. R. Evid. 702. "
1443,39," Membership in the latter two classes is limited to those who purchased tickets within a defined ""class period,"" which began on 
(i) October 10, 1992 with respect to Defendant Northwest, (ii) May 18, 1995 for Defendant U.S. Airways, and (iii) June 11, 1995 
for Defendant Delta. "
1446,40," As noted earlier, Defendants argued in a separate motion that the methodology of Plaintiffs' experts is so flawed, and that the 
fit is so poor between their expert opinions and the facts of this case, that their conclusions must be discounted for purposes of 
resolving the present motions. The Court recently addressed this question in a separate Opinion and Order, holding that the 
opinions of Plaintiffs' experts survive gatekeeping scrutiny under Fed. R. Evid. 702. "
1447,41," For this reason, the Court rejects Defendants' related ""standing"" argument -- i.e., that each named Plaintiff can serve as the 
representative for only those class members who traveled on precisely the same city-pair route. Under the hub-based market 
theory advanced by Plaintiffs and their experts, the antitrust injury allegedly suffered by any particular named Plaintiff would be 
precisely the same as that purportedly suffered by any other passenger who flew into or out of the same hub -- namely, the 
deprivation, by virtue of the exercise of a Defendant's alleged monopoly power, of the opportunity to purchase a hidden-city 
ticket at a lower fare that would provide the same ""product"" as a hub-spoke ticket reflecting the passenger's true itinerary. Given 
the highly similar nature of the claims of all passengers traveling to or from the same hub, minor factual distinctions -- e.g., 
different fares over time -- do not defeat typicality. See  Domestic Air Transp. Antitrust Litigation, 137 F.R.D. at 699. Having said that, the Court is concerned that the named Plaintiffs might not have purchased tickets involving all seven of the hub 
airports at issue here. While it might not be necessary in this case to undertake a detailed market analysis for each and every 
city-pair, such an analysis seemingly is needed for each hub, and all class members who traveled to or from a given hub 
presumably should be able to look to a particular representative to pursue their claims. Accordingly, the Court leaves this matter 
open for further consideration. "
1448,42," Indeed, in its recent Opinion addressing Defendants' various challenges to the opinions of Plaintiffs' experts, the Court 
discussed this point at length, and acknowledged that such comparisons raise a number of legitimate concerns. "
1449,43," Dr. Beyer has endeavored to explain this phenomenon, attributing it to such factors as differences in travel distances and 
natural monopolies on certain spoke-spoke routes. As to the latter, for example, if the hub-spoke route at issue is Detroit to 
Cincinnati, Ohio, it would not necessarily be surprising that a Seattle-Detroit-Cincinnati route did not offer a hidden-city savings 
opportunity."
1449,44," Defendants note, for example, that Dr. Beyer has proposed 29 routes (with 128 separate fares) as benchmarks for the 
allegedly supracompetitive fare charged by Defendant Delta in a single market, Albany-Atlanta. Obviously, some of these 
benchmarks achieve higher savings, and some lower. The question becomes, then, how to isolate the portion of this savings 
that represents a ""hub premium"" due to the Airlines' hidden-city prohibitions, and how to explain the remaining differences 
among all the various savings opportunities once this premium is removed. Dr. Beyer apparently endeavors to resolve these issues by applying a ""minimum average"" method of computation, under which 
the average hidden-city savings percentage is calculated for each fare code on a quarterly basis. Dr. Beyer then chose the fare 
code that achieved the smallest average savings percentage as his benchmark for the alleged anticompetitive overcharge for 
that quarter. For example, upon reviewing the Albany-Atlanta market on the date of September 19, 1995, Dr. Beyer found that 
the average savings percentages under the six applicable fare codes ranged from 11.5 to 14 percent. He used the smallest of 
these averages -- 11.5 percent -- as the alleged overcharge imposed by Defendant Delta on its passengers traveling between 
Albany and Atlanta during this quarter in 1995. "
1451,45," In this regard, it is noteworthy that Defendants have not moved for summary judgment in their favor on the ground of lack of 
standing of any named Plaintiff who has been fully reimbursed for his air travel expenses."
1451,46," The Court does observe, though, that individual ""mini-trials"" are not inevitable here, and that various procedural mechanisms -- 
e.g., detailed questionnaires or sworn affidavits -- might assist in streamlining the requisite individualized inquiries. "
1453,47," This general ruling leaves a number of subsidiary procedural matters yet to be resolved. As noted earlier, for instance, it could 
be argued that each hub airport presents a sufficiently distinct set of circumstances to warrant the creation of subclasses. In 
addition, there are questions as to precisely the sort of notice Plaintiffs must provide to potential class members, and the degree "
1454,," to which this notice should attempt to anticipate the individualized ""standing"" concern alluded to earlier. Counsel should be 
prepared to discuss these and other outstanding procedural issues at a forthcoming status conference to be set by the Court. "
1470,1," The court notes that Defendants do not argue in their briefs that they are entitled to qualified immunity on Plaintiffs' First 
Amendment claims, even though they listed it as a defense in the pretrial order. Because Defendants do not argue qualified 
immunity in their summary judgment briefs, the court does not consider whether they are entitled to the defense. "
1479,1," There are numerous types of DSL technology: ADSL (asymmetric DSL, in which upstream transmissions are much slower than 
downstream), HDSL (high-speed DSL), UDSL (universal DSL), VDSL (very-high-speed DSL), and RADSL (rate-adaptive DSL). 
See Line Sharing Order, 14 FCC Rcd at 20915 n.5. The Commission here and elsewhere refers to these technologies 
collectively as ""xDSL,"" the ""x"" serving as a generic identifier. In the interests of judicial economy, we shall simply use ""DSL"" as 
the generic term. "
1482,2," The Commission's standard for deciding that a network element should be unbundled--whether lack of access to it ""materially 
diminishes"" the requesting carrier's ""ability"" to provide the services in question--implicitly builds in a relation to the prices at 
which CLECs get access to UNEs. (The Commission is rarely clear on precisely what costs are being compared, but in saying 
that lack of access to unbundled elements would cause a material increase in cost it often uses terms implying that the 
comparison is to the Commission-mandated price of unbundled elements, i.e., at present TELRIC. See, e.g., 15 FCC Rcd at 
3815, P 263; 15 FCC Rcd at 3864, P 375.) Lack of access would not diminish the requester's ability at all if it could secure the 
function more cheaply on its own. Thus, the closer the Commission's pricing principle is to the low end of what it may lawfully 
set, the greater the probability that lack of access would cause ""material diminution."" As a result low UNE prices would not only 
have the direct effect mentioned in the text, but would inherently tend to expand the sphere of these effects. As the ""price 
squeeze"" jurisprudence shows, even prices that are set within the band of what is lawfully permissible may have perverse 
effects, and the Commission may be obligated to consider them. Cf.  FPC v. Conway Corp., 426 U.S. 271, 278-79, 48 L. Ed. 2d 
626, 96 S. Ct. 1999 (1976); Sprint Communications Co. L.P. v. FCC, 274 F.3d 549, 555 (D.C. Cir. 2001). "
1483,3," Compare William J. Baumol, On the Proper Cost Tests for Natural Monopoly in a Multiproduct Industry, 67 AMER. ECON. 
REV. 809 (1977) (proposing concept of ""subadditivity"" for ascertainment of natural monopoly), and WILLIAM W. SHARKEY, 
THE THEORY OF NATURAL MONOPOLY (1982) (further development of subadditivity). "
1484,4," We note that scholars have raised very serious questions about the wisdom of the essential facilities doctrine as a justification 
for judicial mandates of competitor access, and accompanying judicial price setting. See, e.g., Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, at P 
771c. But a doctrine that is inadequate for that purpose may nonetheless offer useful concepts for agency guidance when 
Congress has directed an agency to provide competitor access in a specific industry. "
1497,1," Killackey construes the two Sherman Act claims as really being claims for tortious interference with contract under New York 
law. See Killackey Mem. at 13. To the extent that Posr is attempting to make such a claim, it must be dismissed. HN9[
] To 
successfully plead a tortious interference with contract claim, a plaintiff must allege ""the existence of a valid contract, the 
tortfeasor's knowledge of the contract and intentional interference with it, the resulting breach and damages."" Hoag v. 
Chancellor, Inc., 246 A.D.2d 224, 228, 677 N.Y.S.2d 531 (1st Dep't 1998). Here, Posr has not alleged any facts indicating that 
Killackey knew of the existence of a valid contract or that he intentionally interfered with it. Moreover, the contract itself was not 
valid because Posr did not have the right to film the court proceeding in the absence of advance permission from the presiding 
judge. See sections I.B.2 and I.C.2 below. "
1499,2," Posr also did not follow rules that the State of New York enacted with respect to filming court proceedings. These rules were 
enacted at a time that New York's general prohibition on filming in court, Civil Rights Law § 52, was not in effect. See  Boss, 182 
Misc. 2d at 702-03, 705. HN17[
] Section 52, however, took effect again in 1997, prior to Posr's attempt to film in this case. Id. at 702. HN18[
] Under the rules, filming of proceedings may be permitted by a presiding judge upon application by a 
""representative of the news media."" 22 NYCRR § 131.3. The rules provide a number of factors that the judge should consider in 
entertaining an application to film proceedings. 22 NYCRR § 131.4(c). The rules also contemplate an application to the court for 
filming of proceedings by parties not for public dissemination. See 22 NYCRR § 29.1(b)(2). The Attorney General of the State of New York, who represents Killackey in this matter, has asserted that these rules actually 
applied in Posr's case, despite the then-effectiveness of Civil Rights Law § 52. He does not explain why they apply but perhaps it 
is because HN19[
] Civil Rights Law § 52 governs only proceedings in which witnesses have been or may be subpoenaed to "
1500,," testify. Posr does not allege that witnesses were or might have been subpoenaed to testify in the particular Family Court 
proceeding he wished to film and he makes no challenge (or even reference) to Civil Rights Law § 52. In any case, as already 
noted, case law requires an application to the presiding judge prior to filming and Posr himself seems to have recognized that it 
was his obligation to make such an application since he implies -- albeit vaguely -- that a judge issued an ""Order to Show 
Cause"" on this topic. "
1512,1," Plaintiff's exhibits attached to the following briefs are not properly authenticated, as they are not accompanied by sworn 
declarations: 1) Plaintiff's Memorandum of Points & Authorities in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment, October 3, 2001; 
and 2) Plaintiff's Supplemental Brief, March 28, 2002. See  Orr v. Bank of Am., 282 F.3d 1099, 2002 WL 507525, at *3 (9th Cir. 
Apr. 8, 2002). However, as Defendants do not challenge their authenticity, the court will consider them."
1512,2," Plaintiff does not dispute that ""competitors, such as Markem and Xaar, offer printers which, like the Trident printhead, are 
capable of printing barcodes on corrugated materials and kraft paper."" Defendants' Statement of Uncontroverted Facts, 
November 13, 2001, at P16."
1512,3, Plaintiff added ITW as a party to this action after ITW acquired Trident.
1512,4," Plaintiff's motion does not address how Trident's ink containers relate to its tying claim. Trident has maintained throughout this 
litigation that the container and the ink constitute one product. "
1513,5," Tying arrangements may be unlawful per se or pursuant to the Rule of Reason. See County of Tuolumne v. Sonora Cmty. 
Hosp., 236 F.3d 1148, 1157 (9th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted). ""The inquiry mandated by the Rule of Reason is whether the 
challenged agreement is one that promotes competition or one that suppresses competition."" National Soc'y of Prof'l Eng'rs v. 
United States, 435 U.S. 679, 691, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637, 98 S. Ct. 1355 (1978)."
1513,6," The court ordered additional briefing from both parties February 1 and March 15, 2002 on whether Defendants violated Section 
2 of the Sherman Act. "
1515,7," Defendants argue that Plaintiff's motion does not adequately address several requisite elements. Plaintiff merely asserts in its 
reply brief that two distinct products exist in this case because one is a printhead and the other is ink for use with that 
technology. The issue whether two products are distinct ""turns not on the functional relation between them, but rather on the 
character of the demand for the two items."" Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 19, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 
1551 (1984). A tying arrangement is not unlawful unless there is sufficient demand for the tied product separate from that of the 
tying product so as to denote two separate markets. Id. See also  Allen-Myland, Inc. v. International Bus. Machs. Corp., 33 F.3d 
194, 211-12 (3d Cir. 1994); Service & Training, Inc. v. Data Gen. Corp., 963 F.2d 680, 684 (4th Cir. 1992) (Luttig, J.). As 
Defendants note, Plaintiff also fails to address sufficiently whether Defendants' sales of printer ink, the tied product, involved a 
""not insubstantial"" amount of interstate commerce. See  Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 8 (citing Northern Pacific Ry., Inc. v. 
United States, 356 U.S. 1, 11, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545, 78 S. Ct. 514 (1958)). As the antitrust laws are intended to protect competition 
rather than individual competitors, a tying arrangement violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act only if it ""affects a substantial 
volume of commerce in the tied market."" Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 461-62, 119 L. Ed. 
2d 265, 112 S. Ct. 2072 (1992) ( Fortner Enters., Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., 394 U.S. 495, 503, 22 L. Ed. 2d 495, 89 S. 
Ct. 1252 (1969) (""Fortner I"")); Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701, 97 S. Ct. 690 
(1977). ""The controlling consideration is simply whether a total amount of business, substantial enough in terms of dollar-volume 
so as not to be merely de minimis, is foreclosed to competitors by the tie. . . ."" Datagate, Inc. v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 60 F.3d 
1421, 1425 (9th Cir. 1995) (quoting Fortner I, 394 U.S. at 501). Regardless, both parties seem to agree that market power will be 
the dispositive element in this case. "
1516,8," Grid Sys. Corp. v. Texas Instruments, Inc., 771 F. Supp. 1033, 1037 (N.D. Cal. 1991) did not hold to the contrary. That case 
involved the Patent Misuse Reform Act of 1988 and, in a footnote, quoted an article written by a practitioner in Des Moines, Iowa 
opining that ""the presumption of economic power, when the tying product is a patent or copyright, survives."" Id. at 1037 n.2 
(citing Richard Calkins, Patent Law: The Impact of the 1988 Patent Misuse Reform Act and Noerr-Pennington Doctrine on 
Misuse Defenses and Antitrust Counterclaims, 38 DRAKE L. REV. 175, 196 (1989)). However, the court cited this article for the 
proposition that the Patent Misuse Reform Act does not amend the Sherman Act rather than as part of a holding that a patent 
confers market power. "
1517,9," In her oft-quoted concurrence, Justice O'Connor recognized that ""[a] common misconception has been that a patent . . . 
suffice[s] to demonstrate market power . . . [because] a patent holder has no market power in any relevant sense if there are 
close substitutes for the patented product."" She was joined by Chief Justice Burger, Justice Powell, and Justice Rehnquist. 
Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 37 n.7 (O'Connor, J., concurring). Less than a year later, Justice White, joined by Justice 
Blackmun, stated that ""a particular tying arrangement may have procompetitive justifications, and it is thus inappropriate to 
condemn such an arrangement without considerable market analysis."" Data General Corp. v. Digidyne Corp., 473 U.S. 908, 908, 
87 L. Ed. 2d 657, 105 S. Ct. 3534 (1985) (order denying writ of certiorari) (White, J., dissenting) (citations omitted). The fact that 
six of the justices who decided Jefferson Parish would reject the notion that a patent confers market power as a matter of law 
supports the court's conclusion that Plaintiff's reliance upon Jefferson Parish is misplaced."
1517,10," Plaintiff cites several vintage Supreme Court cases in support of its argument, including United States Steel Corp. v. Fortner 
Enters., 429 U.S. 610, 51 L. Ed. 2d 80, 97 S. Ct. 861 (1977) (""Fortner II""); White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 9 L. 
Ed. 2d 738, 83 S. Ct. 696 (1963); United States v. Loew's, Inc., 371 U.S. 38, 9 L. Ed. 2d 11, 83 S. Ct. 97 (1962); International 
Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. 392, 92 L. Ed. 20, 68 S. Ct. 12 (1947). The Court's language concerning presumptions of 
market power based upon patents arose at a time when genuine proof of power in the market for the tying product was not 
required. See PHILLIP E. AREEDA, ET AL., ANTITRUST LAW P1737a (1996). However, in Jefferson Parish, the Court began 
demanding real proof of such market power. See id. "
1518,11," Defendants argue that Congress likely abrogated any presumption in tying cases that a patent confers market power upon its 
holder. Four years after the Supreme Court decided Jefferson Parish, Congress passed the Patent Misuse Reform Act of 1988, 
which provides that a tying arrangement does not constitute patent misuse in the absence of market power. 35 U.S.C. § 
271(d)(5). If, as is clear, a patent is insufficient to establish market power in tying cases when considering the ""patent misuse 
defense,"" it would be anomalous for the same patent to be sufficient to establish market power in the same case for purposes of 
a counterclaim under the Sherman Act. See PHILLIP E. AREEDA, ET AL., ANTITRUST LAW P1737c (1996) (""The Patent Act 
amendment effectively abolishes any presumption of market power for patents or patented tying products in antitrust suits as 
well as in patent misuse doctrine.""). The court need not resolve this issue for purposes of deciding the instant motions."
1518,12," Plaintiff cites unauthenticated anecdotal evidence that some of Trident's customers were dissatisfied with having to buy 
Trident's ink. However, Trident's customers' opinions of the tying arrangements are insufficient to establish that Trident had 
market power. "
1519,13," Plaintiff's claims under the Cartwright Act are predicated upon the same facts as its claims under Section 1 and Section 2 of 
the Sherman Act. Plaintiff does not address these claims independently of its Sherman Act claims."
1519,14," Plaintiff's complaint asserts that the relevant markets are ""commercial ink jet inks, patented containers for said commercial ink 
jet inks and patented printing systems in which said commercial ink jet inks are used."" Fourth Amended Complaint P19. Plaintiff 
proffers no evidence or argument in support of this assertion. "
1520,15," Undertaking no analysis, Plaintiff asserts that ""because Trident held patents, no one else could make that system. 
Accordingly, there was zero elasticity of supply in the relevant (tying product) market during the relevant time period."" Plaintiff's 
Supplemental Brief, March 28, 2002, at 5. However, Plaintiff's bald assertion does not account for other printheads that can print 
bar codes on corrugated materials and kraft paper, as well as close substitutes, such as labeling machines."
1520,16," Plaintiff's argument that the market is defined by Defendants' printhead system is more relevant to its claim that Defendants 
attempted to monopolize the market for ink. See  Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 482-83, "
1521,119," L. Ed. 2d 265, 112 S. Ct. 2072 (1992) (""Because service and parts for Kodak equipment are not interchangeable with other 
manufacturers' service and parts, the relevant market from the Kodak equipment owner's perspective is composed of only those 
companies that service Kodak machines.""). This argument is addressed in Section IV.1. "
1522,17," Although the Supreme Court has identified potential sources of market power, it has not clearly articulated a standard as to 
what constitutes sufficient economic power to force a tie. See Christopher R. Leslie, Unilaterally Imposed Tying Arrangements 
and Antitrust's Concerted Action Requirement, 60 OHIO ST. L.J. 1773, 1830-36 (1999). A persuasive argument may be made 
that ""the most appropriate test to determine whether any individual has sufficient market power to force consumers to accept a 
tie-in is the 'monopoly power' standard of Section Two jurisprudence."" Id. at 1831. The Court might well agree with this 
proposition, as it has previously acknowledged that ""the essence of illegality in tying agreements is the wielding of monopolistic 
leverage."" Times-Picayune Publ'g, 345 U.S. at 611. Regardless, Plaintiff cannot establish Defendants possess market power 
because it does not define the relevant market."
1522,18," Thus, even assuming Trident had over 90% of the ""piezo ink jet engine[s]"" for ""industrial printing,"" as Plaintiff contends, 
Plaintiff has not, in fact, established that this is the relevant market for purposes of the Sherman Act. "
1523,19," Plaintiff did not move for summary judgment on its Section 2 claim or proffer any evidence in support of its allegations that 
Defendants monopolized, attempted to monopolize, or conspired to monopolize the tying product market or the market for ink 
containers. Moreover, as discussed above, Plaintiff cannot establish that Defendants had ""monopoly power"" in the market for the 
tying product for purposes of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, because it cannot make the lesser showing that Defendants had 
""market power"" in any defined market for purposes of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. See  Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image 
Technical Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 481, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265, 112 S. Ct. 2072 (1992). "
1524,20," As Trident points out, end users are not bound by the tying arrangements between Trident and the OEMs. See Defendants' 
Supplemental Brief, March 22, 2002. "
1525,21," Claims for attempted monopolization also require that the plaintiff define the product and geographic markets. Spectrum 
Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 459-60, 122 L. Ed. 2d 247, 113 S. Ct. 884 (1993). "
1526,22," Plaintiff complains that Trident does not warranty its printhead system for use with third-party inks. However, merely limiting or 
voiding a product's warranty based upon consumer use of third-party consumables does not violate the antitrust laws. See, e.g., 
Marts v. Xerox, Inc., 77 F.3d 1109, 1112 (8th Cir. 1996) (Xerox's policy of conditioning its photocopiers' service warranties upon 
consumers using Xerox cartridges did not violate antitrust laws)."
1526,23," Plaintiff argues that Defendants' tying arrangements with the OEMs constitute a barrier to entry. The court need not address 
potential barriers to entry facing a competitor who wishes to sell ink for use in conjunction with Trident's printhead system (i.e., 
Defendants' tying arrangements, Defendants' alleged misrepresentations that third-party inks corrode Trident's printheads, or the 
fact that Trident's printheads use single-use ink containers), because Plaintiff's failure to define either the product market or the 
geographic market is fatal to its case. "
1536,1," Counts I through V of Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint are similar to Counts I through V of Plaintiff's First Amended 
Complaint. Rather than having Defendant and Plaintiff unnecessarily duplicate previously filed motions, responses, replies, and 
supporting documents which were unaffected by the later filing of Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint, see ""II. Procedural 
Background"" infra, this Court granted the parties leave to file supplemental motions, responses, replies, and supporting 
documents as necessary to encompass any amendments to Counts I through V found in Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint. "
1538,2," Section 5. Distributor Ownership and Transfers. See n.6. 7, 8 infra."
1538,3," Section 3.4 Submissions to Miller. Distributor shall submit only complete and accurate notices, reports, claims, reimbursement 
requests, payment requests or other communications to Miller. Records of all transactions, including all price promotion 
allowance programs instituted by Miller, shall be maintained by Distributor for a minimum of three (3) years or as prescribed by 
state law, whichever is longer. Miller shall have the right to audit all such records. For any Miller price promotion allowance 
program, Distributor shall be required to file forms prescribed by Miller from time to time. Miller may audit any reimbursement 
claims filed by Distributor. In the event Miller finds errors greater than One Thousand Dollars ($ 1,000.00), or such other dollar 
amount set by Miller from time to time. Miller may calculate the percentage rate of error and using that percentage rate of error, 
extrapolate the amount owed to Miller for up to the prior three (3) years total reimbursement claims made by Distributor to Miller. 
Miller shall notify Distributor of the extrapolated audit results. Within thirty (30) days of such notice, Distributor must either pay 
the extrapolated amount to Miller or pay for the cost of a full audit by Miller or Miller's designee. Miller reserves the right to 
enforce other appropriate remedies, including those described in Section 7 below. See n.4, 5 infra. "
1539,4," Section 7.1. Termination With Cure. Except as provided in Section 7.2 below, Miller may at any time initiate termination in 
accordance with the procedures specified in this Section if Distributor fails to comply with any commitment or undertaking stated 
in its application, or with any of the obligations set forth in this Agreement or the Standards, or as otherwise permitted by state 
law."
1539,5," Section 7.2. Termination Without Cure. If any of the following events occur, Miller shall have the right to terminate this 
Agreement immediately upon giving written notice without any obligation on Miller's part to follow the procedures described in 
Section 7.1 above or to make a Termination with Cure Payment to Distributor: . . . (b) Distributor's fraudulent conduct or substantial misrepresentation in any of its dealings with Miller or with others concerning 
Miller products. (c) Any significant variation between the financial data submitted to Miller in Distributor's application and the actual financial 
condition of Distributor as reflected in Distributor's balance sheet at the time Distributor commences operations under this 
Agreement . . . (e) Distributor's insolvency (including Distributor's inability to pay its debts as they mature) or failure to pay monies due Miller in 
accordance with the terms of sale established by Miller. Distributor's assignment or attempt to assign for the benefit of creditors, 
the institution of bankruptcy proceedings by or against Distributor, or the dissolution or liquidation of Distributor. . . . (j) Distributor's failure to undertake a good-faith effort to cure noncompliance pursuant to Section 7.1 above. See n.4 supra (k) Any other right to terminate granted under state law, statute or regulation. "
1542,6," Section 5.2(a). Letter of Intent. Prior to any such Transfer, Distributor shall deliver to Miller a bona fide nonbinding letter of 
intent negotiated on an arm's length basis duly executed by Distributor and the proposed purchaser, which letter of intent shall 
be expressly made subject to Miller's rights described in this Section and shall set forth all the essential terms of the transaction, 
including the property subject to the Transfer; the consideration to be paid; the representations and warranties to be given by 
Distributor; and, all other material terms and conditions which would be contained in a definitive purchase and sale agreement. 
Such letter of intent and a distributor application completed by the proposed purchaser shall be submitted to Miller within five (5) 
days after execution by Distributor of the letter of intent. "
1543,7," Section 5.2(d). Review of Proposed Purchaser. . . . Miller shall have sixty (60) days from receipt of the completed distributor 
application to approve or disapprove the proposed purchaser and transaction. Distributor may Convey its business in 
accordance with the letter of intent subject to Miller's prior written approval of the proposed purchaser, which approval shall not 
be unreasonably withheld . . . . Miller shall notify Distributor in writing if Miller disapproves the proposed purchaser. The notice 
will include the reasons for the disapproval. If Miller disapproves the proposed purchaser, Distributor shall not Convey its rights 
under this Agreement or render itself unable to fulfill its obligations hereunder unless and until it obtains Miller's approval as 
described in this Section 5.2."
1543,8," Section 5.4. Approval Criteria. In determining whether to approve or disapprove, as the case may be, a proposed Transfer, 
change of ownership or any other disposition of an ownership interest in Distributor's business under this Section 5, Miller may 
consider the qualifications of the proposed purchaser or transferee to fulfill the obligations of this Agreement, the effects of the 
resulting business combination, the resulting territory configuration, the potential advantages of alternative market combinations, 
and such other facts and circumstances that Miller reasonably may deem to be relevant. In evaluating the proposed purchaser's 
or transferee's qualifications. Miller may consider such factors as it deems appropriate, including: (a) Whether the proposed purchaser or transferee has the financial resources to purchase and own Distributor or the specified 
interest in it upon terms which will not jeopardize the future operation of the Distributor business, and whether under such 
ownership Distributor will be able to provide the financial support (including but not limited to market spending, capital 
expenditures, and any equity capitalization or refinancing requirements) necessary for the successful operation of the Distributor 
business and to comply with the terms of this Agreement. (b) Whether the proposed purchaser or transferee and manager have the proven business experience to successfully operate 
the Distributor business, including whether the non-owner management of the proposed purchaser or transferee has appropriate 
incentives to comply with the Distributor obligations under this Agreement. Prior experience in the wholesale malt beverage 
distribution business is strongly preferred by Miller. If a proposed purchaser or transferee would be a first time Miller distributor, 
the purchaser must be willing to participate along with Distributor's management in a series of training classes in order to be 
educated on Miller's business practices. (c) Whether the proposed purchaser or transferee after the Transfer will be engaged in selling competing brands of malt 
beverages or other products to the extent that such sales would, in the reasonable judgment of Miller, interfere with the 
successful marketing of, and time and resources devoted to, the Miller products in Distributor's Area."
1543,9," Section 2.2. Payment Terms. . . . Regardless of the method of payment, Distributor hereby grants, and Miller shall retain, a 
security interest in products and containers delivered to Distributor until Miller receives full payment of all monies owed to Miller. 
Upon Miller's request, Distributor shall execute such documents as are necessary to perfect Miller's security interest "
1544,10," Section 3.2. Performance Standards. Distributor shall, by using its best efforts, vigorously and aggressively sell, deliver, 
merchandise, and promote the full package line of Miller products listed on the Distributor Data Sheet. Distributor shall also 
comply at all times with those Distributor obligations described in the Performance Standards and its subparts, including Sales, 
Operations, Quality, and Finance (""the Standards""), receipt of which is hereby acknowledged. The Standards may be modified 
from time to time by Miller upon the giving of reasonable notice to Distributor and any such modifications shall not be deemed an 
amendment to this Agreement. The Standards, as modified from time to time by Miller, shall be identical for all other authorized 
Miller distributors. . . . (d) Finance. Distributor shall maintain sufficient working capital to ensure that its facilities, equipment, inventory, and personnel 
are adequate to compete effectively with other non-Miller brands of malt beverages. "
1547,11," Section 1.6. Reservations of Rights. Miller reserves the unqualified right to manage and conduct its business in all respects 
and shall be free at all times . . . to determine the prices or other terms on which it sells Miller products Section 2.1. Sale Terms. The prices charged by Miller to Distributor for Miller products and other applicable terms of sale shall 
be those established by Miller and in effect on the date of shipment. Miller shall inform Distributor of its prices and other 
applicable terms of sale in writing from time to time, but Miller shall have the unlimited right to change prices and to establish 
terms of sale at any time. "
1549,12," Preamble to Agreement. Miller Brewing Company (""Miller"") and the undersigned Distributor recognize that the success of Miller and each of its 
authorized distributors depends largely on the reputation and competitiveness of Miller products and distributors' 
performance, and on how well each fulfills its responsibilities to one another and our customers. Therefore, this Agreement 
imposes on both Miller and Distributor an obligation of good faith in its performance or enforcement. Conformance with the 
express terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute compliance with such good faith obligation. "

1560,14," Defendants filed their answer and counterclaim in federal court. A reconventional demand was not asserted in state court prior 
to removal."
1560,15," See,  Isbell, 9 F. Supp. 2d at 733 (""HN8[
] The Court must look to the allegations in the complaint that are necessary to state 
a claim, and assertions of defenses that raise federal issues are insufficient for jurisdictional purposes when the complaint itself 
does not plead federally-cognizable matters."") (citations omitted). "
1566,1," References to documents are to public records in state court proceedings, of which Rayburn invited the Court to take judicial 
notice. See FED. R. EVID. 201(d) HN1[
] (""A court shall take judicial notice if requested by a party and supplied with the 
necessary information.""), see also Lovelace v. Software Spectrum, Inc., 78 F.3d 1015, 1017-18 (5th Cir. 1996) HN2[
] 
(""Normally, in deciding a motion to dismise for failure to state a claim, courts must limit their inquiry to the facts stated in the 
complaint and the documents either attached to or incorporated in the complaint. However, courts may also consider matters of 
which they may take judicial notice.""). "
1567,2," Further; although Lamar refers to the statements of a Rayburn representative as to how he would interpret the settlement 
agreement, these statements were made in the litigation in response to deposition questions. Lamar does not allege that this 
person took any action besides answering questions in the legal proceeding in which Rayburn pursued its claims. "
1569,1," Section 17200 has no official name, but has been referred to as the ""unfair competition law"" by our Supreme Court. ( Cel-Tech 
Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 169, fn. 2, 973 P.2d 527 [Cel-Tech].) "
1570,2," The action was originally filed in Los Angeles and transferred to Alameda County on March 31, 2000. After the court sustained 
demurrers to the first two complaints with leave to amend, appellant filed the second amended complaint."
1570,3," The second cause of action, pertaining to use of a computer program to calculate payments, was dismissed with prejudice. No 
argument is raised regarding that claim."
1570,4, The entire policy was the subject of an unopposed request for judicial notice in the trial court.
1570,5," Unless otherwise indicated, all statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code. "
1571,6," Appellant argues that fire policies are different because fire claims are more susceptible to fraud than medical payment 
provisions. Appellant cites no example or authority to support this purported distinction. There is no indication that fraudulent 
medical payment claims are not a problem. (See. e.g., People v. O'Casey (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 967, 969-970 [defendant 
received medical payment for fraudulent claim]; Jaffe v. Cranford Ins. Co. (1985) 168 Cal. App. 3d 930, 214 Cal. Rptr. 567 
[reference to action against doctor for Medi-Cal fraud].) "
1572,7," There is nothing unusual about a specific time limit in an insurance policy. ""Such a provision, even though requiring notice 
within such a short interval as ten days, is considered reasonable for the purpose of permitting investigation to prevent fraud and 
imposition."" (3 Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice (1967 ed.) ch. 77, § 1393, pp. 12-14, fns. omitted.) "
1573,8," We note that the provision allows submission of bills or receipts for treatment. A claimant receiving treatment who has no 
control over billing would often be in a position to request a receipt at the time of treatment. We will not assume, absent 
allegations in the complaint, that Farmers refuses payment to, for example, hospitalized or unconscious claimants who are 
unable to submit receipts or bills within 60 days."
1573,9," The complaint alleges legal conclusions, such as the contention that the 60-day provision is unfair, unenforceable and a 
violation of the notice-prejudice rule. It also alleges speculative possibilities, such as ""consumers like Levitsky rely on the 
representation or are confused or deceived, which thereby induces consumers not to bill for medical services which were not or 
could not be submitted within 60 days . . . ."" However, there is no allegation that Levitsky or anyone else ever failed to submit a 
late bill because of the policy provision. "
1588,1," See Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters, Jan. 8, 1969, 
art. 5, 20 U.S.T. 361, 658 U.N.T.S. 163; Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(f)(1). "
1589,2," As an alternative, Plaintiff also asserts that the Court could apply Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(2), the national long-arm statute. Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 4(k)(2) permits courts to aggregate a nonresident defendant's contacts with the United States as a whole, but only if the 
defendant is not subject to the jurisdiction of any one state. As explained infra, however, the Court finds that Altadis, S.A. is 
within the reach of the Florida long-arm statute. Rule 4(k)(2) is therefore irrelevant. "
1590,3," Because Plaintiff argued in its pleadings that Altadis, S.A.'s national contacts as opposed Florida contacts apply, Plaintiff did 
not rely on any particular sections of the Florida long-arm statute. The Court must therefore match Plaintiff's general arguments 
with the applicable sections."
1590,4," This standard is the functional equivalent of HN13[
] the continuous and systematic contact requirement for general jurisdiction under the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Meier, 288 F.3d at 1269 n.6 (citing Woods v. Nova 
Cos. Belize, Ltd., 739 So. 2d 617, 620 (Fla. 4th DCA 1999)). "
1595,5," HN27[
] Section 2 of the Sherman Act provides in pertinent part: ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among 
the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony."" 15 U.S.C. § 2 (2002). "
1598,6," In Key Enterprises of Del., Inc. v. Venice Hosp., 919 F.2d 1550, 1566-68 (11th Cir. 1990) (""Key I""), reh'g granted, 979 F.2d 806 
(11th Cir. 1992), vacated as moot, 9 F.3d 893 (11th Cir. 1993) (""Key II""), cert. denied 511 U.S. 1126 (1994), an Eleventh Circuit 
panel did recognize a monopoly leveraging claim. However, while a petition for rehearing was pending, the parties settled the 
case. The panel's decision was therefore vacated, and the case was remanded to the district court for dismissal. Key II, 9 F.3d at 
899. Nonetheless, even if the panel's decision had become mandate, it would be distinguishable from this case. The Key I panel 
found monopoly leveraging applicable because the plaintiff had ""abused its monopoly power in one market as a means of 
gaining a competitive advantage and monopolizing another market . . . ."" Key I, 919 F.2d at 1568. Here, Plaintiff has merely 
alleged that Defendants have gained a competitive advantage in the ""leveraged"" market without showing that they have 
monopolized it. "
1599,7," The Cuban embargo, regulated under the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, 31 C.F.R. §§ 515.101-515.901 (2002), was 
codified by the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (Libertad) Act, Pub. L. No. 104-114, 110 Stat. 785 (1996) as 22 U.S.C. § 
6032(h). HN39[
]  31 C.F.R. § 515.201(b) prohibits transactions involving property in which Cuba, or any national thereof, has ""any interest of any nature whatsoever, direct or indirect."""

] ""'Full-line' or 'representative-line' forcing occurs when a 'manufacturer agrees to license or franchise a dealer to sell 
its products, but only on condition that the dealer sell a full or representative line of those products.'"" S. Card & Novelty, Inc. v. 
Lawson Mardon Label, Inc., 138 F.3d 869, 875 n.8 (11th Cir. 1998) (quoting Smith Mach. Co. v. Hesston Corp., 878 F.2d 1290, 
1294 (10th Cir. 1989))."
1599,9," HN41[
] Sherman Act § 1, 15 U.S.C. § 1, which prohibits contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in ""restraint of trade,"" and Clayton Act § 3, 15 U.S.C. § 14, which makes illegal engaging in commerce so as to ""substantially lessen competition,"" are 
considered under the same standard. S. Card & Novelty, 138 F.3d at 874 (quoting Bob Maxfield, Inc. v. American Motors Corp., 
637 F.2d 1033, 1037 (5th Cir. 1981)); see also  Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 23 n.39, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 
104 S. Ct. 1551 (1984) (noting that ""with respect to the definition of tying the standards used by the two statutes are the same""). "
1601,10," Plaintiff also alleges in the complaint that Antonio Vasquez, one of Defendant Altadis U.S.A.'s agents made deceptive 
statements about the lack of ""fixed assets"" that could trigger ""the Helms-Burton law."" Compl. P 35. This allegation does not, 
however, relate to the Lanham Act claims. "
1604,1," As pointed out in 5 Martin, Dean and Webster, Michigan Court Rules Practice (3rd ed., 1990), 16, 19, n 10, the provisions of 
MCR 3.501(A) mirror those found in the rule of federal civil procedure that governs class actions brought in the federal courts, 
FR Civ P 23(b)(3). Thus, it is appropriate to consider federal cases construing the federal court rule for guidance. Brenner v 
Marathon Oil Co. 222 Mich App 128, 133 (1997). "
1605,2," Because the parties fully briefed whether the plaintiffs had established predominance relative to all three elements, for the sake 
of a full adjudication of the issues raised in the plaintiffs' motion for class certification, the court proceeds to determine the merits 
of the parties' arguments relative to each of the elements notwithstanding that the court's analysis of the predominance factor 
relative to the third element is dispositive."
1605,3," MCL 445.772 states, ""A contract, combination or conspiracy between 2 or more persons in restraint of, or to monopolize trade 
or commerce in a relevant market is unlawful."""
1605,4," MCL 445,773 states, The establishment, maintenance, or use of a monopoly, or any attempt to establish a monopoly, of trade 
or commerce in a relevant market by any person, for the purpose of excluding or limiting competition or controlling, fixing or 
maintaining prices, is unlawful."" "
1606,5," See, Page, ""The Limits of State Indirect Purchaser Suite: Class Certification in the Shadow of Illinois Brick,"" 67 Antitrust L J 1, 
2, n 8 (1999) for a compilation of these state statutes. In California v ARC America Corp, 490 U.S. 93; 109 S Ct 1661; 104 L Ed 
2d 86 (1989), the United States Supreme Court upheld the validity of these type of statutes In the face of a challenge that federal 
antitrust law preempted them. "
1607,6," Yet, it has been observed that Calculation of a ""but for"" price for ultimate consumers in price-fixing cases may be simpler than 
supposed by the Court in Hanover Shoe, and that ""the complexities associated with a ""top-down"" pass-on analysis are greatly 
overblown."" In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litigation, 200 FRD 326, 344 (ED Mlch, 2001). "
1608,7," These tables chart wholesale list prices, Dr. McCormick Aff't, P 28, p 15, compare the producer price index with the list 
wholesale price, id., P 31, p 17, and compare the producer price index and consumer price index, id., P 32, p 18. "
1609,8," Dr. Snyder described in greater detail how manufacturers' pricing programs to both wholesalers and retailers dramatically 
reduced or negated the effect of a price increase. From the records before him, he concluded that participation in these 
programs was not consistent and hence further led to a non-uniform rate at which an increase in the manufacturers' list price 
was passed on the consumer. Dr. Snyder Aff't., PP 59. "
1610,9," As explained by Dr. McCormick, correlation analysis attempts to determine whether ""two variables measured over time move 
predictably in the same direction, in opposite directions or in no discernable manner with respect to each other ... If the 
correlation coefficient were zero, then the factors affecting the two prices cannot be the same, and in fact must be unrelated to 
each other. At the other end of the extreme, if the correlation were 1.0 (the maximum possible value), the factors that impact 
prices, and the magnitude of their impact must be Identical."" McCormick Supplemental Aff't., PP 26, 28. "
1614,10," Based on the foregoing cases in which Indirect purchaser price fixing cases were certified, this court declines to find, as a 
matter of law, that indirect purchaser price fixing claims could never certified class action. "
1616,11," Indeed, as advocated by some, the recipient of a fluid recovery fund could be an entity wholly unrelated to the injured plaintiffs. 
For example, in Vauter, ""The Next Best Thing,"" 80 Mich Bar J 68 (July, 2001), the author advocated that the State Bar of 
Michigan Access to Justice Fund be a repository for unclaimed class action settlement funds. "
1623,1," The term ""pass on"" describes ""the process by which a middleman in the chain of distribution who has been charged by a 
manufacturer or by a producer adjusts his prices upward so as to pass on his increased costs to his own customers."" Annot., 55 
A.L.R. Fed. 919, 922 n.3. (1981)."
1623,2," Justice Blackman, joining in Justice Brennan's Illinois Brick dissent, commented if not for Hanover Shoe he was certain the 
court in Illinois Brick would have permitted indirect purchasers to maintain an antitrust action.  Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 765, 97 
S. Ct. at 2085, 52 L. Ed. 2d at 737 ( Blackmun, J., dissenting). Commenting on Hanover Shoe, Justice Brennan stated, ""despite "
1624,," the superficial appeal of the argument that Hanover Shoe should be applied 'consistently,' thus precluding plaintiffs and 
defendants alike from proving that increased costs were passed along the chain of distribution, there are sound reasons for 
treating offensive and defensive passing-on cases differently."" Id. at 754, 97 S. Ct. at 2078, 52 L. Ed. 2d at 730 ( Brennan, J., 
dissenting). Justice Brennan stated the same policies at the heart of Hanover Shoe--""insuring continued effectiveness of the 
treble-damages action and preventing wrongdoers from retaining the spoils of their misdeeds""--favor permitting indirect 
purchasers to prove they absorbed an overcharge as a result of a direct purchaser's pass on. Id. Justice Brennan advocated 
limiting Hanover Shoe to cases where the defendant uses the pass on theory defensively and where direct and indirect 
purchasers are not parties in the same action. Id."
1624,3," Congress enacted the first of the federal antitrust statutes in 1890 under the Sherman Act. In it, Congress authorized a private 
cause of action for treble damages and attorney's fees to any person injured as a result of antitrust violations. This provision was 
reenacted as section four of the Clayton Act."
1624,4," A Maryland federal district court granted Microsoft's motion to dismiss the money damages claims in a number of private 
antitrust cases against Microsoft virtually identical to the case before us.  In re Microsoft Corp. Antitrust Litig., 127 F. Supp. 2d 
702 (D. Md. 2001), leave to appeal denied sub nom. Kloth v. Microsoft Corp., No. 01-656, CA-11-2117-JFM (4th Cir. June 27, 
2001). The Maryland court in this case held the plaintiffs as indirect purchasers were barred from bringing claims for alleged 
overcharges under federal law, pursuant to Illinois Brick. However, the court expressly reserved comment on whether Illinois 
Brick was incorporated into the state law of a number of states pending resolution of current appeals, including the one before 
us, that raised the issue. See also Arnold v. Microsoft Corp., No. 00- CI-00123, 2001 WL 193765 (Ky. Cir. Ct. July 21, 2000), 
aff'd, No. 2000- CA-002144-MR, 2001 WL 1835377 (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 21, 2001); Kieffer v. Mylan Labs., No. BER-L-365-99-EM, 
1999 WL 1567726 (N.J. Super. Sept. 9, 1999); Arnold v. Microsoft Corp., No. 00- CI-00123, 2001 WL 193765 (Ky. Cir. Ct. July 
21, 2000), aff'd, No. 2000- CA-002144- MR, 2001 WL 1835377 (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 21, 2001). "
1625,5," The distinction between direct and indirect purchasers in antitrust law is akin to early distinctions in product liability tort law 
between tort plaintiffs in privity with the manufacturer and those who were not in direct privity. Early cases refused to allow 
injured plaintiffs to recover from the manufacturer if the parties were not in privity. However, the trend in tort law soon relaxed

1647,1," The record in this case reflects that the nine states and the District of Columbia proceeding to litigate this case prefer to be 
called the ""Litigating States,"" as opposed to the ""Non-Settling States."" As a matter of courtesy, the Court will refer to this group 
of plaintiffs by their chosen title, or simply as ""Plaintiffs."""
1647,2," This amicus brief was filed by the States of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, 
Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee,

1647,3," The history of this case is lengthy and complicated. As not all of the historical details are pertinent to the instant motion, the 
Court will recount, in summary form, limited portions of the procedural history of this case. "
1648,4," The suit styled as State of New York, et al. v. Microsoft Corp., No. 98-1233, was originally brought by twenty states and the 
District of Columbia. One state withdrew from the action prior to the issuance of liability findings by the District Court. Another 
state settled its claims in July of 2001."

upon which relief can be granted, (7) failure to join a party under Rule 19."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b). "
1649,6," ""It is well established that, HN4[
] in passing on a motion to dismiss, whether on the ground of lack of jurisdiction over the 
subject matter or for failure to state a cause of action, the allegations of the complaint should be construed favorably to the 
pleader."" See  Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236, 40 L. Ed. 2d 90, 94 S. Ct. 1683, 71 Ohio Op. 2d 474 (1974), abrogated 
on other grounds by  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 73 L. Ed. 2d 396, 102 S. Ct. 2727 (1982). In its consideration of a 
motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, a district court may look beyond the pleadings to inquire into facts pertinent to its 
jurisdiction. See  Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731, 735 n.4, 91 L. Ed. 1209, 67 S. Ct. 1009 (1947)."

state a ground for relief, the ensuing dismissal of the case ""would be on the merits, not for want of jurisdiction."" Bell, 327 U.S. at 
682."
1649,8," For Microsoft's non-jurisdictional arguments, the Court may apply the ordinary summary judgment standard. HN7[
] Summary 
judgment should be granted only if no genuine issues of material fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a 
matter of law. See  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265, 106 S. Ct. 2548 (1986). In ruling upon a 
motion for summary judgment, the Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See  
Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986); Bayer v. United 
States Dep't of Treasury, 294 U.S. App. D.C. 44, 956 F.2d 330, 333 (D.C. Cir. 1992). "
1650,9," The centrality of the issues of antitrust standing and injury is not strikingly apparent from Microsoft's opening memorandum, in 
part, because Microsoft does not initially distinguish its discussion of parens patriae standing from its discussion of antitrust 
standing and injury. Nevertheless, the Court draws this distinction at the outset to reflect the fact that the case law which 
establishes the doctrine of parens patriae standing proceeds along a separate channel from the body of law that defines antitrust 
standing and injury. See infra Section III.B. "
1652,10," The Supreme Court explained in Allen: HN18[
] The Art. III doctrine that requires a litigant to have ""standing"" to invoke the power of a federal court is perhaps the 
most important of these doctrines. ""In essence the question of standing is whether the litigant is entitled to have the court 
decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues."" Warth v. Seldin, [422 U.S. 490, 498, 45 L. Ed. 2d 343, 95 S. Ct. 
2197 (1975)]. Standing doctrine embraces several judicially self-imposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction, such 
as the general prohibition on a litigant's raising another person's legal rights, the rule barring adjudication of generalized 
grievances more appropriately addressed in the representative branches, and the requirement that a plaintiff's complaint fall 
within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked. See [Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for 
Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 474-475, 70 L. Ed. 2d 700, 102 S. Ct. 752 (1982)]. The requirement of 
standing, however, has a core component derived directly from the Constitution. A plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly 
traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief. [Id. at 472]."
1652,468, U.S. at 750-51.
1652,11," The distinction between prudential and true Article III standing is immaterial in this discussion because HN19[
] the D.C. 
Circuit treats prudential aspects of standing as being ""akin"" to core Article III requirements for purposes of assessing subject 
matter jurisdiction. American Immigration Lawyers Ass'n v. Reno, 339 U.S. App. D.C. 341, 199 F.3d 1352, 1357-58 (D.C. Cir. 
2000). Notwithstanding this treatment, the D.C. Circuit recognizes that the prudential aspect of standing is ""an element that the 
courts must dispense with if Congress so provides."" Maryland People's Counsel v. FERC, 245 U.S. App. D.C. 248, 760 F.2d 
318, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1985); see also  Warth, 422 U.S. at 501 (""Congress may grant an express right of action to persons who 
otherwise would be barred by prudential standing rules.""). While there can be said to be an aspect of ""standing"" in a court's evaluation of the statutory basis for a plaintiff's claim, this 
aspect of standing for purposes of establishing jurisdiction presents a low threshold. The plaintiff need only state a claim which is 
not so ""patently insubstantial"" that the exercise of jurisdiction is not warranted. Best v. Kelly, 309 U.S. App. D.C. 51, 39 F.3d 328, 
330-31 (D.C. Cir. 1994); see supra note 7; infra Section III.B. Where that minimal requirement is met, the Court's inquiry departs 
from the realm of jurisdiction and turns to the merits of the case. See  Best, 39 F.3d at 331; see supra note 7; infra Section III.B. 
The Court observes that, if the doctrines of antitrust standing and injury are regarded as statutory requirements, any potential 
attack on Plaintiffs' satisfaction of those requirements in this case has been waived by Defendant's failure to raise this challenge 
to the merits in a timely manner. See  Shutte v. Thompson, 82 U.S. (15 Wall.) 151, 159, 21 L. Ed. 123 (1872) HN20[
] (""A party 
may waive any provision, either of a contract or of a statute, intended for his benefit.""). "
1653,12," Berger and Bernstein are quite clear that antitrust standing is separate from both the purely constitutional and the prudential 
aspects of the constitutional doctrine of standing: HN21[
] Because the doctrine of antitrust standing reflects the special antitrust policy considerations mentioned above, its 
focus is somewhat different from that of standing doctrines familiar to constitutional lawyers. In constitutional litigation, the 
initial standing question is whether the claimant is alleging a ""particular, concrete injury"" that gives him a ""personal stake in 
the outcome"" of the adjudication, and thereby meets the constitutional and prudential requirement of injury in fact. . . . . Antitrust plaintiffs pass this constitutional threshold by alleging the statutorily required ""injury in [their] business or property."" 
Since such economic injury satisfies the constitutional standing requirement of injury in fact, the antitrust standing injury is 
not concerned with whether the plaintiff has constitutional standing. Berger and Bernstein, 86 Yale L. Rev. at 813 n.11 (citations omitted) (alteration in Berger and Bernstein) (emphasis added)."
1653,13," The Court is aware that HN23[
] courts are not ""bound by decisions on questions of jurisdiction made sub silento in previous 
cases 'when a subsequent case finally brings the jurisdictional issue' to the Court."" LaShawn A., 87 F.3d at 1395 n.6 (quoting 
Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 119, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67, 104 S. Ct. 900 (1984) (""Pennhurst II"")); 
accord  United States v. L.A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., 344 U.S. 33, 38, 97 L. Ed. 54, 73 S. Ct. 67 (1952) (""Even as to our own 
judicial power or jurisdiction, this Court has followed the lead of Chief Justice Marshall who held that this Court is not bound by a 
prior exercise of jurisdiction in a [previous] case where it was not questioned and it was passed sub silento.""); IPAA II, 235 F.3d 
588 at 597. However, as in LaShawn A., that rule ""plainly has nothing to do with this [case]"" because ""the quoted portion of 
Pennhurst II dealt with the stare decisis effect of decisions in other cases, not the effect of earlier decisions by the same 
appellate court in the same case."" LaShawn A., 318 U.S. App. D.C. 380, 87 F.3d 1389 n.6 (emphasis in original)."
1653,14," HN24[
] Waiver, as a doctrine related to law-of-the-case doctrine, dictates that a ""legal decision made at one stage of 
litigation, unchallenged on subsequent appeal when the opportunity to do so existed [governs] future stages of the same 
litigation, and the parties are deemed to have waived the right to challenge that decision at a later time."" Crocker, 49 F.3d at 739 
(quoting Williamsburg Wax Museum, Inc. v. Historic Figures, Inc., 258 U.S. App. D.C. 124, 810 F.2d 243, 250 (D.C. Cir. 1987)) 
(alteration in Crocker). This species of the waiver doctrine presents an ""analytically distinct principle: unlike law-of-the-case 
doctrine proper, this bar on raising issues omitted from prior appeals . . . does not involve any previous appellate court decision 
on the barred issue."" Id. As articulated by the Court of Appeals in Crocker, the doctrine of waiver is not a precise fit with the 
posture of this case, at least while the case is pending at the district court level. As noted above, Microsoft's ""waiver"" argument 
does not appear to rely upon this species of waiver."
1653,15," As defined by Black's Law Dictionary, HN25[
] to waive is ""to abandon, renounce, or surrender (a claim, privilege, right, etc.); 
to give up (a right or claim) voluntarily."" Black's Law Dictionary 1574 (7th ed. 1999). Waiver is defined as the ""voluntary 
relinquishment or abandonment -- express or implied -- of a legal right or advantage."" Id. "
1654,16," The Insurance Corp. of Ireland Court stated: [HN29[
] A] court, including an appellate court, will raise lack of subject-matter jurisdiction on its own motion. ""The rule, 
springing from the nature and limits of the judicial power of the United States is inflexible and without exception, which 
requires this court, of its own motion, to deny its jurisdiction, and, in the exercise of its appellate power, that of all other 
courts of the United States, in all cases where such jurisdiction does not affirmatively appear in the record."""
1654,456," U.S. at 702 (quoting Mansfield, C. & L. M. R., 111 U.S. at 382) (second alteration in Insurance Corp. of Ireland). "
1655,17," The mandate provides in full: These causes came on to be heard on the record on appeal from the United States District Court for the District of 
Columbia and were argued by counsel. On consideration thereof, it is ORDERED and ADJUDGED, by the Court, that the judgment of the District Court appealed from in these causes is hereby 
affirmed in part, reversed in part, remanded in part, the final judgment embodying the remedial order is vacated in full and 
the cases are remanded with instructions, all in accordance with the opinion for the Court filed herein this date. Microsoft, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330, 253 F.3d 34, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 14324, 2001-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) P73321, Nos. 00-5212 
and 00-5213 (D.C. Cir. June 28, 2001)."
1655,18," The holding in IPAA II does not detract from this conclusion, as that case is plainly distinguishable on the facts. In that case, 
on the first appeal, IPAA I, the Court of Appeals addressed two cases consolidated at the District Court level, IPAA v. Babbitt 
and Samedan Oil Corp. v. Deer, and reversed the District Court's grant of summary judgment on two discrete issues. IPAA II, 
235 F.3d 588 at 592. On its second appeal, IPAA argued that its claim originally included a challenge to the [agency decision challenged by the companion case, Samedan 
Oil Corp. v. Deer,] and that in IPAA I [the Court of Appeals] reversed the District Court's order granting summary judgment 
against IPAA in its challenge to [the agency decision in] Samedan. IPAA suggested [that] the District Court ignored this 
mandate by refusing to enter a judgment in its favor and subsequently dismissing its complaint. According to IPAA, by 
reopening questions already determined in earlier phases of this litigation, the District Court violated the mandate rule. IPAA II, 235 F.3d 588 at 594. In response to these arguments, applying the rule in LaShawn A., the Court of Appeals held that 
the mandate rule did not foreclose the District Court's consideration of jurisdiction because ""the question of whether IPAA had 
challenged [the agency decision in Samedan] was not before us, nor decided by us, even by implication."" 459 U.S. 519 at 597. 
In stark contrast, in this case, the Court of Appeals heard an appeal by Defendant from all adverse rulings following a full trial on 
the merits of the plaintiffs' claims, the issuance of findings of fact and conclusions of law, and the imposition of a remedy. Given 
the appellate court's unfaltering obligation to inquire about its own jurisdiction, Defendant cannot argue that the issue of 
jurisdiction was somehow not before the Court when it heard Microsoft's appeal from Judge Jackson's final judgment on the 
merits of Plaintiffs' claims. "
1656,19," It is not clear whether, in referencing ""Article III jurisdiction to entertain those common issues presented by all plaintiffs,"" 
General Building Contractors, 458 U.S. at 402 n.22, the term ""Article III jurisdiction"" was intended to encompass ""both 
constitutional limitations on federal-court jurisdiction and prudential limitations on its exercise."" Warth, 422 U.S. at 498. Erring on 
the side of caution, the Court will presume for purposes of its analysis in this case that the inquiry into ""Article III jurisdiction"" in 
this context includes both constitutional and prudential considerations. See  Allen, 468 U.S. at 750-51 (""HN31[
] The Art. III 
doctrine that requires a litigant to have 'standing' to invoke the power of a federal court is perhaps the most important of these 
doctrines. . . . Standing doctrine embraces several judicially self-imposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction, such as 
the general prohibition on a litigant's raising another person's legal rights, the rule barring adjudication of generalized grievances 
more appropriately addressed in the representative branches, and the requirement that a plaintiff's complaint fall within the zone 
of interests protected by the law invoked.""). "
1657,20," ""Parens patriae means literally 'parent of the country.'"" Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, 458 U.S. 592, 600, 73 L. 
Ed. 2d 995, 102 S. Ct. 3260 (1982) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1003 (5th ed. 1979)). "
1658,21," Although the District Court reached this conclusion in the context of a discussion of intrastate injury in conjunction with its 
analysis of certain state laws, Microsoft, 87 F. Supp. 2d at 55, the conclusion is nonetheless applicable to the Plaintiff States' 
claims under federal law."
1658,22," HN37[
] For Article III purposes, the breadth of the injury among the several states is not relevant, as limitations on claims for 
broadly felt injuries are not constitutionally based. See  Warth, 422 U.S. at 501 (holding that Article III is satisfied by an allegation 
of a ""distinct and palpable injury . . . even if it is an injury shared by a large class of other possible litigants"" because Congress 
may ""grant[] a right of action"" and provide standing to ""invoke the general public interest in support of their claim""). Such 
limitations are prudential and thus, are subject to alteration by Congress. Id. "
1659,23," Microsoft concedes that the term ""state-specific injury"" is a ""Microsoft"" term, which does not appear in the case law. Remedy 
Hrg. Tr. at 7359. "
1660,24," Indeed, BMW concerned an attempt by Alabama to ""impose economic sanctions on violators of its laws with the intent of 
changing the tortfeasors' lawful conduct in other States."" 517 U.S. at 572. "
1661,25," Microsoft quotes selectively from the language in Borden to imply that suits by the federal government are intended to 
supersede suits by private litigants, including states in their parens patriae capacity. Microsoft Mem. at 15. The holding in Borden 
does not go that far. To the contrary, Borden holds only that HN43[
] suits by private litigants resulting in an injunction do not 
preclude suits by the United States for injunctive relief. Borden, 347 U.S. at 518-20. "
1662,26," Some antitrust statutes expressly encourage state litigation as parens patriae. See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. § 15c."
1662,27," As no judgment has been entered in United States v. Microsoft Corp., at this point, the Court need not address Microsoft's 
argument that entry of a final judgment in United States v. Microsoft Corp. constitutes res judicata such that the Litigating States 
cannot obtain relief in their own case. "
1663,28," The policy arguments raised in the United States' amicus brief, and to a lesser extent in Microsoft's memoranda, regarding the 
Court's exercise of its equitable powers, although not specifically addressed in this Memorandum Opinion, have not passed 
unnoticed. Once again, however, given the unique posture of this case, including specific instructions from the Court of Appeals 
to ""afford[] the parties a proper opportunity to be heard"" on the issue of remedy, Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 105, the Court does not 
regard these arguments as sufficient to justify the ""dismissal"" of Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief. The Court has yet to 
determine whether these policy considerations will inform the Court's exercise of its equitable powers in devising a remedy in 
this case. "
1681,1," The phrase ""Broker-Dealers"" describes the business of all defendants except Bloomberg and I will use it to refer to these 
companies as a collective entity."
1681,2," As is appropriate on defendant's motion for summary judgment, I have considered all facts in the light most favorable to 
InterVest."
1681,3," Until 1991, government bonds were also traded in a closed system. However a system called GovPX now operates as a real-
time reporting service for quotes and transactions in Treasury securities."
1681,4," Plaintiff has taken many of its facts from the ACT Notes kept by Fondren and other InterVest employees. As used by InterVest, 
beginning in 1992, the database provided a means of recording significant events and conversations relevant to the company's 
business. After a meeting, Fondren would use a tape recorder to report on the meeting and then his administrative assistant 
would transcribe the tape into the ACT Notes system. Cowen argues that many, if not all, of the ACT Notes entries constitute inadmissible hearsay. In reply, InterVest offers numerous 
justifications and exceptions to the hearsay rule providing for their admissibility. Additionally, the deposition testimony of Fondren 
repeats much of what the ACT Notes contain. After careful consideration of the issues involved, I have determined that I need "
1682,," not rule on the admissibility of the ACT Notes to dispose of the summary judgment motion. Therefore, for purposes of 
defendant's motion for summary judgment, I have considered the entries in the ACT Notes as evidence of the alleged 
conspiracy."
1682,5," Bloomberg contends that its relationship with InterVest was somewhat of an accident. Plaintiff approached Bloomberg as early 
as 1993 about commencing a relationship between the companies and at that time Bloomberg indicated it had no interest. In 
1995, a Bloomberg salesman with no knowledge of the previous interaction approached InterVest about becoming a Bloomberg 
subscriber. (First Amended Counterclaim at P 19; Dep. of Charles Garcia at 55.)"
1682,6," Because the InterVest trading system had been independently designed, both Bloomberg and InterVest needed to invest a 
significant amount of work into making their two systems compatible. "
1683,7," Garcia acknowledges both this conversation with Fondren and his conversation with Bill Matthews of Cowen, but claims that 
Matthews did not complain about InterVest, and simply mentioned in passing that he had seen the publicity on the InterVest 
product. (Dep. of Garcia at 161-62.)"
1683,8," Apparently, Joseph Cohen and Larry Fondren had a mutual friend who remained continually optimistic about the chances of 
cooperation between their two companies and encouraged these repeated meetings. (Dep. of Fondren at 836.) "
1684,9," As InterVest employees started looking for other work, some employees of other firms responded less than warmly. One 
worker at Credit Suisse First Boston responded to an employment inquiry by stating, ""Tried to fuck the street. What'd you think 
would happen????!!"""
1684,10," If InterVest was to succeed, it needed to obtain a sufficient supply of bonds to attract would-be purchasers. As only the broker-
dealers and inter-broker dealers maintained a large supply of bonds, InterVest needed some of these dealers to agree to place 
their bonds for sale on its transparent trading system. Despite InterVest's attempts to convince the dealers to participate, no one 
agreed to place its ""supply"" on the InterVest system."
1684,11," Defendant points out that in December 1997, InterVest had another explanation for its financial woes. In a letter written to 
Marc Michel, Managing Director of EOS Partners, counsel for InterVest accused EOS of failing to honor its investment 
obligations and convincing other investors to follow suit thereby preventing InterVest from ""developing and marketing a 
promising business."" (Letter of December 29, 1997, from Robert Hayes to Marc Michel.) "
1685,12," Plaintiff goes to great lengths in attempt to directly link this statement to Michael Bloomberg and have not successfully done 
so, at least in part because Bloomberg could not produce the notes of the meeting where ""Mike"" made this statement. Granting 
plaintiff all reasonable inferences, I have assumed that the statement was made by Michael Bloomberg, though it does not seem 
particularly relevant precisely who made the statement."
1685,13," In addition to bringing its claim under the Sherman Act, InterVest has alleged a violation of Pennsylvania's antitrust law. HN3[ ] Pennsylvania has no separate antitrust statute and therefore the ""allegation rises or falls with plaintiff's federal antitrust 
claims."" Alvord-Polk, Inc. v. F. Schumacher & Co,, 37 F.3d 996, 1014 (3d Cir. 1994) (citing  Collins v. Main Line Bd. of Realtors, 
452 Pa. 342, 304 A.2d 493 (Pa. 1973)). "
1686,14," HN7[
] Though the statutory language seems to apply to all restraints on trade, court decisions have interpreted this 
provision to mean that only unreasonable restraints of trade are illegal. See, e.g., Business Elecs. Corp. v. Sharp Elecs. Corp., 
485 U.S. 717, 723, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808, 108 S. Ct. 1515 (1988)."
1686,15," Without explicitly saying so, the defendant appears to acknowledge that the allegations warrant per se treatment. In its motion 
for summary judgment, Cowen challenges only the necessary elements of a per se violation of § 1-- plaintiff's ability to 
demonstrate concerted action and antitrust injury. "
1687,16," This does not mean, however, that memorandum lacks any probative value and accordingly, the court will consider it as 
circumstantial evidence of the alleged conspiracy. "
1689,17," The evidence that Joseph Cowen did not know why the system operated as it did and that he did not make prices public for 
fear of being shut out of the market, number 2 above, seems only to support the existence of a closed trading system, and that 
the market did not look favorably upon opening up the market, facts not in dispute in this case."
1689,18," Throughout its earlier submissions to the court, plaintiff argued that Bloomberg was a one of a kind resource of financial 
information and was vital to its success. At oral argument, I asked plaintiff why it would matter to Bloomberg if Cowen used their 
system. Plaintiff responded that collectively the broker-dealers could have retaliated and used a different system. Though I did 
not pursue the issue further, it seems that if such alternatives existed, plaintiff could have also used them, thereby undercutting 
its argument that being on Bloomberg was essential to their survival."
1689,19," The parties do not disagree with the characterization of Cowen as a relatively minor Bloomberg customer. While Cowen made 
much of its limited power to pressure Bloomberg, InterVest argued that where direct evidence of an agreement exists, that 
constraint has little relevance. However, plaintiff also acknowledged that where there is only indirect evidence, Cowen's lesser 
influence over Bloomberg would take on a more important role in deciding this motion. Plaintiff has presented no evidence of contact between Bloomberg and other broker dealers (with the exception of a vague 
allusion to Tull in Tokyo, who was not named as a defendant in this case). However, Cowen's complaint may have provided the 
impetus for Bloomberg's evaluation of its relationship with InterVest. Though Bloomberg may have then feared retaliation from 
larger customers, this fear does not support the existence of an agreement between defendant and other broker-dealers or 
between defendant and Bloomberg. "
1693,20," HN18[
] In interpreting a tortious interference claim, courts have looked to the Restatement of Torts for guidance. The 
Restatement instructs courts to consider the factual scenario in its entirety and consider the propriety of a defendant's actions 
and lists factors relevant in considering propriety. These inquiries include the type of conduct, the motive underlying that 
conduct, the interest with which that action interferes and the interests advanced by it, societal interests in either protecting or 
condemning the conduct, the nexus between the conduct and interference, and the nature of the relationship between the 
parties. See Ruffing v. 84 Lumber Co., 410 Pa. Super. 459, 600 A.2d 545, 549 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1991) (quoting Restatement

regulate the communications industry. See  Iowa Utils. Board, 525 U.S. at 403-04 (Thomas, J. concurring in part and dissenting "

1713,6," The defendant contends that the plaintiff essentially describes an overcharge claim, which only resulted in an indirect injury. 
While the plaintiff's alleged receipt of poor service means that it paid too much for the service it received, the plaintiff's claim for 
damages cannot be narrowly pigeon-holed into the category of an excessive charge. The plaintiff contracted for a basic level of 
adequate service with the expectation that it would receive such service. Instead, the defendant's misconduct allegedly disrupted 
these expectations, and perhaps damaged the plaintiff's business. Such allegations describe a direct injury."
1713,7," Subsections (a), (b), and (c) of Section 251 read: HN15[
] § 251. Interconnection "
1714,," (a) General duty of telecommunications carriers Each telecommunications carrier has the duty-- (1) to interconnect directly or indirectly with the facilities and equipment of other telecommunications carriers; and (2) not to install network features, functions, or capabilities that do not comply with the guidelines and standards established 
pursuant to section 255 or 256 of this title. (b) Obligations of all local exchange carriers Each local exchange carrier has the following duties: (1) Resale The duty not to prohibit, and not to impose unreasonable or discriminatory conditions or limitations on, the resale of its 
telecommunications services. (2) Number portability The duty to provide, to the extent technically feasible, number portability in accordance with requirements prescribed by the 
Commission. (3) Dialing parity The duty to provide dialing parity to competing providers of telephone exchange service and telephone toll service, and the 
duty to permit all such providers to have nondiscriminatory access to telephone numbers, operator services, directory 
assistance, and directory listing, with no unreasonable dialing delays. (4) Access to rights-of-way The duty to afford access to the poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way of such carrier to competing providers of 
telecommunications services on rates, terms, and conditions that are consistent with section 224 of this title. (5) Reciprocal compensation The duty to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the transport and termination of telecommunications. (c) Additional obligations of incumbent local exchange carriers In addition to the duties contained in subsection (b) of this section, each incumbent local exchange carrier has the following 
duties: (1) Duty to negotiate The duty to negotiate in good faith in accordance with section 252 of this title the particular terms and conditions of 
agreements to fulfill the duties described in paragraphs (1) through (5) of subsection (b) of this section and this subsection. 
The requesting telecommunications carrier also has the duty to negotiate in good faith the terms and conditions of such 
agreements. (2) Interconnection The duty to provide, for the facilities and equipment of any requesting telecommunications carrier, interconnection with the 
local exchange carrier's network-- (A) for the transmission and routing of telephone exchange service and exchange access; (B) at any technically feasible point within the carrier's network; (C) that is at least equal in quality to that provided by the local exchange carrier to itself or to any subsidiary, affiliate, or any 
other party to which the carrier provides interconnection; and (D) on rates, terms, and conditions that are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory, in accordance with the terms and 
conditions of the agreement and the requirements of this section and section 252 of this title. (3) Unbundled access "
1715,," The duty to provide, to any requesting telecommunications carrier for the provision of a telecommunications service, 
nondiscriminatory access to network elements on an unbundled basis at any technically feasible point on rates, terms, and 
conditions that are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement 
and the requirements of this section and section 252 of this title. An incumbent local exchange carrier shall provide such 
unbundled network elements in a manner that allows requesting carriers to combine such elements in order to provide such 
telecommunications service. (4) Resale The duty-- (A) to offer for resale at wholesale rates any telecommunications service that the carrier provides at retail to subscribers 
who are not telecommunications carriers; and (B) not to prohibit, and not to impose unreasonable or discriminatory conditions or limitations on, the resale of such 
telecommunications service, except that a State commission may, consistent with regulations prescribed by the 
Commission under this section, prohibit a reseller that obtains at wholesale rates a telecommunications service that is 
available at retail only to a category of subscribers from offering such service to a different category of subscribers. (5) Notice of changes The duty to provide reasonable public notice of changes in the information necessary for the transmission and routing of 
services using that local exchange carrier's facilities or networks, as well as of any other changes that would affect the 
interoperability of those facilities and networks. (6) Collocation The duty to provide, on rates, terms, and conditions that are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory, for physical 
collocation of equipment necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network elements at the premises of the 
local exchange carrier, except that the carrier may provide for virtual collocation if the local exchange carrier demonstrates 
to the State commission that physical collocation is not practical for technical reasons or because of space limitations."
1715,47, U.S.C. §§ 251 (a)-(c). 
1717,8," Because the interconnection agreement in this case is closely linked to section 251 of the Telecommunications Act, the dissent 
argues that the defendant's failure to fulfill its obligations under the agreement may also support a right of action under 47 U.S.C. 
§§ 206 & 207, which may provide a right of action for violations of the Telecommunications Act. While it is true that the New York 
Public Service Commission found that the interconnection agreement in this case ""does not violate the requirements of the Act,"" 
this finding was ""subject to clarifications discussed below [in the text of the Commission's Order Approving Interconnection 
Agreement]."" See Order Approving Interconnection Agreement, 1997 WL 410707, at *3. The Commission's language confirms 
that the particular form of the duties defined by the interconnection agreement in this case do not simply reiterate the general 
duties imposed by section 251."
1717,9," The complaint does not allege that Bell Atlantic violated subsection (a) of section 251. Moreover, subsection (a) only requires 
basic interconnection and compatibility of standards. The complaint does not describe conduct by Bell Atlantic that would violate 
these duties."
1717,10," We stress that because this is a case where an interconnection agreement has been entered into by the parties and approved 
by the state, we do not decide whether a plaintiff can bring suit for a violation of the duties under section 251 when there is no 
such agreement. Moreover, we emphasize that our analysis is limited to section 251 of the Telecommunications Act and does 
not address other provisions of that Act. "
1719,11," We do not suggest that any or every disruption in local phone service would support an essential facilities claim. For example, 
a minor, isolated, and accidental disruption in access to an essential facility would be insufficient as a matter of law to establish 
an antitrust violation. There must be sufficient evidence to conclude that the defendant controlling the essential facility denied or 
disrupted a competitor's access to that facility with the intention of maintaining its monopoly power. "
1720,12," We observe that while the defendant must be a competitor of the entity to which it denies reasonable access to the essential 
facility for there to be a violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act, see  Official Airline Guides, Inc. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 630 
F.2d 920, 926 (2d Cir. 1980), the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15, provides a consumer plaintiff directly injured by such an antitrust 
violation with a cause of action regardless of whether the consumer plaintiff is a competitor of the defendant."
1720,13," The plaintiff has also asserted an attempted monopolization claim. HN30[
] To establish such a claim, a plaintiff must show 
that the defendant ""(1) engaged in anticompetitive or predatory conduct with (2) specific intent to monopolize and (3) a 
dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power."" AD/SAT v. Associated Press, 181 F.3d 216, 226 (2d Cir. 1999). This claim 
is derivative of the monopoly leveraging and essential facilities claims. If the plaintiff demonstrates that the defendant engaged in 
monopoly leveraging, or denied it reasonable access to an essential facility, then it has established the first element of the 
attempted monopolization claim that the defendant engaged in anticompetitive behavior. Based on our reading of the amended 
complaint, however, the plaintiff does not describe any additional predatory or anticompetitive conduct that would establish the 
first prong of an attempted monopolization claim. While on remand, the plaintiff may add allegations that would describe 
additional predatory behavior, at this point, the plaintiff has not established a separate attempted monopolization claim. "
1721,14," Citing Justice Breyer's partial concurrence and partial dissent in AT&T Corp. v. Iowa Utils. Bd., 525 U.S. at 428-29, the 
defendant generally asserts that duties requiring sharing of infrastructure may actually reduce competition. But Justice Breyer's 
point was made in the context of an argument for applying an ""essential facilities"" standard to the sharing requirements of the 
Telecommunications Act. Justice Breyer only contended that sharing might reduce competition when the sharing involved a 
resource that was not an ""essential facility."" In the case at hand, in contrast, the plaintiff alleges that the local network is an 
""essential facility."" "
1722,15," HN36[
] Under section 252, an ILEC could theoretically negotiate an interconnection agreement that defined its duties in a way that conflicts with subsections (b) and (c) of section 251. See  47 U.S.C. § 252 (a)(1). But the defendant has not contended 
that this particular interconnection agreement conflicts with principles of antitrust law. Moreover, it seems unlikely to us that the 
LEC entering the market would agree to an interconnection agreement that would in some way reduce competition in the market 
by restricting the LEC's access to the local loop. If such a conflict were to arise, the state regulatory commission would resolve 
the dispute, using section 251 as a guideline. See  47 U.S.C. § 252 (c)(1)."
1722,16," In contrast, there is specific statutory authority that the negotiation of such an agreement fulfills the telecommunication carrier's 
duties under subsections (b) and (c) of section 251. See  47 U.S.C. § 251 (c)(1). "
1723,17," The defendant cites Town of Concord v. Boston Edison Co., 915 F.2d 17 (1st Cir. 1990), an opinion written by Justice Breyer 
when he was a circuit judge, for the general proposition that regulation inherently reduces the risk of antitrust harm. Town of 
Concord, however, must be read in light of its particular context, a claim alleging a price squeeze in the public utilities industry 
where regulators had the authority to maintain prices at ""reasonable"" levels.  Id. at 25-26. The subject matter of this litigation 
focuses on the issue of equal access to networks. On this appeal from an order granting a motion to dismiss, we cannot assess 
the effectiveness of regulation in this industry. In contrast, Town of Concord was an appeal after a jury trial where the First 
Circuit had a complete record to make this determination."
1723,18," In this case, the relevant regulatory action was directed at AT&T's injuries, not the alleged injuries of AT&T's consumers. Thus, 
this is not a case like Pan Am. World Airways, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 296, 313 n.19, 9 L. Ed. 2d 325, 83 S. Ct. 476 
(1963), where a civil antitrust suit was dismissed because an administrative agency may have had the power to award the same 
remedy being pursued in that suit. The defendant has not argued that the plaintiff could and should seek an administrative 
remedy in this case. Moreover, there is no evidence that any regulatory body has the authority to compensate the plaintiff for its 
injuries."
1723,19," We note that this is an action brought by an injured consumer and not an LEC. Our decision does not address whether LECs 
seeking to enter the market may ever bring antitrust suits against the ILEC. In this case, we note that the interconnection 
agreement requires the parties to the agreement to resolve their disputes through arbitration and the administrative process. See  
Order Approving Interconnection Agreement, 1997 WL 410707, at *23, § 16. We also note that HN37[
] the 
Telecommunications Act provides telecommunications carriers with incentives to negotiate interconnection agreements and 
utilize the regulatory process. ILECs who wish to enter the long distance market are required to meet certain requirements. 
Some of those requirements can be met by successfully negotiating an interconnection agreement. See  47 U.S.C. § 271 
(c)(2)(A)(i)(I). The LEC may have the incentive to proceed through negotiating such an agreement because the regulatory 
process is likely to provide access to the local network sooner than the court system. Thus, we do not believe that allowing 
antitrust actions by injured consumers to proceed will necessarily cause telecommunications carriers to avoid the regulatory 
process. "

1734,18," Chugach suggests that federal antitrust law provides an ""overlay to state law"" that bars the commission from exercising its 
general powers and precludes its long-standing interpretation of AS 42.05.221. But we disagree. In the Sherman Act, ""Congress, 
exercising the full extent of its constitutional power, sought to establish a regime of competition as the fundamental principle 
governing commerce in this country."" City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 398, 55 L. Ed. 2d 364, 98 
S. Ct. 1123 (1978) (internal citations omitted). In California Retail Liquor Dealers Ass 'n v.  Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 105, 63 L. Ed. 2d 233, 100 S. Ct. 937 (1980), 
the Court found two standards for antitrust immunity stemming from the Court's earlier decision in Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 
341, 87 L. Ed. 315, 63 S. Ct. 307 (1943): ""First, the challenged restraint must be one clearly articulated and affirmatively 
expressed as state policy; [and] second, the policy must be actively supervised by the State itself."" Id. at 105 (internal quotation 
marks and citations omitted). Alaska's policy of anticompetitive conduct for utilities that have a certificate of public convenience 
and necessity is not only permitted but compelled. HN10[
]  AS 45.50.572(d) immunizes public utilities that have been issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity from state antitrust law.  AS 42.05.221(a) requires certificates of public 
convenience before a utility can operate.  AS 42.05.221(d) then allows the commission to take appropriate action to control 
competition if it finds that competition not in the public interest. These statutes, read separately or together, evidence a stronger 
case for meeting the first prong of Midcal than was seen in S. Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v. United States, 471 U.S. 
48, 64, 85 L. Ed. 2d 36, 105 S. Ct. 1721 (1985). In that case, the Court upheld a practice allowing a rate bureau to submit a joint 
rate proposal for rates on behalf of its members to the applicable state agency in each state for consideration regardless of the 
fact none of these states had legislation compelling collective ratemaking, noting that, ""if more detail than a clear intent to 
displace competition were required of the legislature, States would find it difficult to implement through regulatory agencies their 
anticompetitive policies."" Id. at 64. HN11[
] The purpose of the agency is to deal with problems outside the realm of the 
legislature's knowledge. Id. Thus, to require ""express authorization for every action that an agency might find necessary to 
effectuate state policy would diminish, if not destroy, its usefulness."" Id. Chugach does not argue whether the State of Alaska's 
policy to regulate public utilities is actively supervised by the state in its brief, relying instead on its arguments regarding the first 
prong of the Midcal test. Despite the fact Chugach did not argue against it, it seems relatively clear that the issuance of 
certificates of public convenience as well as other policies relating to public utilities are actively supervised by the state. Unlike 
the situation in Snake River Valley Elec. Ass'n v. PacifiCorp, 238 F.3d 1189 (9th Cir. 2001), where the utility with the distribution 
facilities had the power to withhold its consent from other utilities wishing to serve its customers, ML&P has no such power. 
Therefore, the second prong of Midcal is easily met. "

1779,1," The Court finds it highly relevant that the beach at Hanauma Bay is not an ordinary beach; HN2[
] Hanauma Bay is 
designated as a Marine Life Conservation District, governed by H.R.S. Chapter 190 and Hawaii Administrative Rules (""H.A.R."") 
Title 13 (Department of Land and Natural Resources), Chapter 28. H.A.R. HN3[
] Section 13-28-2 provides in relevant part that 
no person shall, at Hanauma Bay: (1) Fish for, catch, take, injure … or remove any finfish, crustacean, mollusk including sea shell and opihi, live coral, algae 
or limu, or other marine life, or eggs thereof; (2) Take, alter, deface, destroy … or remove any sand, coral, rock, or other geological feature or specimen; (3) Have or possess any fishing gear or device, including but not limited to any hook-and-line, rod, reel, spear, trap, net, 
crowbar, or other device, or noxious chemical that may be used for the taking, injuring, or killing of marine life, or the 
altering of geological feature or specimen, … (4) Introduce any food, substance, or chemical into the water, to feed or attract marine life. HAW. ADMIN. R. § 13-28-2. HN4[
] The Hanauma Bay Marine Life Conservation District includes not only the area covered by 
the bay waters but also the beach. The district runs from the highwater mark at the shoreline (being the vegetation line, see  
State v. Sotomura, 55 Haw. 176, 182, 517 P.2d 57 (1973)) out to certain designated points offshore. See id. at § 13-28-1. 
Because Hanauma Bay is designated as a swimming and snorkeling zone, save two limited exceptions not available to 
recreational boaters, no watercraft of any description is permitted to operate or moor in the area. Id. at § 13-256-88. "
1780,2," Plaintiffs indicated that they have agreed to voluntarily dismiss this claim in their Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion to Dismiss, or 
Alternatively, for Partial Summary Judgment Regarding Plaintiffs' Claims under Count VII for Violations of the Fourth 
Amendment."
1780,3," Plaintiffs' proposed Class was defined as ""non-residents of Hawaii who have been required to pay $ 3.00 to access the public 
beach at Hanauma Bay."" See Order, filed 4/25/02, at 7."
1780,4," Plaintiffs' proposed sub-class I was defined as ""those non-residents who have paid the $ 3.00 access fee."" See Order, filed 
4/25/02, at 7. "
1781,5," Plaintiffs' proposed sub-class II was defined as ""those non-residents who have been unable or unwilling to access the beach at 
Hanauma Bay, despite a desire to do so, as the result of the imposition of the $ 3.00 access fee."" See Order, filed 4/25/02, at 7."
1781,6," Plaintiffs' counsel represented, upon inquiry by the Court at a brief hearing held on May 29, 2002, that the members of sub-
class I alleged no consequential damages other than the $ 3.00 entry fee paid."
1781,7," For the sake of convenience, hereinafter, the term ""Plaintiffs"" refers to members of sub-class I, including Plaintiff Daly. Plaintiff 
Burgess, not a class member, is referred to as ""Plaintiff Burgess."" "
1783,8," The Court acknowledges that ""HN20[
] implicit in the right to engage in activities protected by the First Amendment [is] a corresponding right to associate with others in pursuit of a wide variety of political, social, economic, educational, religious, and 
cultural ends."" Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 621, 82 L. Ed. 2d 462, 104 S. Ct. 3244 (1984). However, if the 
contemplated activity does not fall within the protections of the First Amendment, association for the purpose of pursuit of that 
activity likewise is not protected. See  City of Dallas v. Stanglin, 490 U.S. 19, 24-25, 104 L. Ed. 2d 18, 109 S. Ct. 1591 (1989) 
(activity of dance hall patrons-coming together to engage in recreational dancing-not form of ""expressive association""); Swank, "
1784,898," F.2d at 1250 (""The purpose of the free-speech clause and of its judge-made corollary the right of association is to protect 
the market in ideas …."")."
1784,9," The Perry Court likely found that exhaustive analysis of this issue was unnecessary. See  Perry Educ. Ass'n, 460 U.S. at 44 
(""There is no question that constitutional interests are implicated by denying PLEA use of the interschool mail system."")."
1784,10," The Court emphasizes that Hanauma Bay is not merely a beach, but a nature preserve and conservation district. "
1785,11," The Court recognizes that HN27[
] the context in which the conduct takes place can add to or detract from the conduct's 
expressive qualities. In Stone v. Agnos, 960 F.2d 893 (9th Cir. 1992), the Plaintiff, a homeless man, argued ""that his sleeping in 
a public place 'dramatized' the plight of the homeless."" Id. at 895. Though the Ninth Circuit did not decide the issue, conceivably 
conduct such as sleeping which is typically not expressive could be seen as conveying a message. Plaintiff Burgess has not 
demonstrated why non-expressive conduct such as lying, sitting, or playing at the beach somehow transmits a special message 
by virtue of its taking place at Hanauma Bay."
1785,12," The Court clarifies that although visitors partake in certain beach activities, Hanauma Bay, as a nature preserve and 
conservation district, also provides educational opportunities and experiences not available in ordinary beach settings."
1785,13," The Court finds that Nunez, a case in which the Ninth Circuit struck down a curfew ordinance, is distinguishable in that ROH 
Sec. 10-2.11's imposition of the $ 3.00 entry fee does not restrict ""access to any and all public forums"" and does not have ""an 
integral effect on the ability of [nonresidents] to express themselves."" Nunez, 114 F.3d at 950-51. "
1786,14," HN30[
] The Privileges and Immunities Clause applies to municipalities as well as states. See  United Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council v. City of Camden, 465 U.S. 208, 215 (""It is as true of the Privileges and Immunities Clause as of the Equal 
Protection Clause that what would be unconstitutional if done directly by the State can no more readily be accomplished by a city 
deriving its authority from the State.""). "
1787,15," HN33[
] Although the constitutional source of the ""right to travel"" is disputed, see  United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745, 758,"
1787,16," L. Ed. 2d 239, 86 S. Ct. 1170 (1966) (noting that ""there have been recurring differences in emphasis within the Court as to 
the source of the constitutional right of interstate travel""), the Supreme Court acknowledged that the Privileges and Immunities 
clause protects at least one component of the ""right to travel."" See  Saenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489, 501, 143 L. Ed. 2d 689, 119 S. 
Ct. 1518 (1999)."
1787,16," Though the Privileges and Immunities Clause was not in issue, the Ninth Circuit took a similar approach in Nunez when 
analyzing ""fundamental rights"" in the Equal Protection context and the First Amendment. See  Nunez v. City of San Diego, 114 
F.3d 935, 944 n.6 (9th Cir. 1997) (""The rights of free movement and travel and the right to free expression are integral to our 
analysis of the [sic] whether the ordinance unconstitutionally burden minors' fundamental rights. We discuss them separately for 
clarity's sake; courts have articulated different tests to examine burdens on First Amendment rights and on other fundamental 
rights.""). Additionally, the Court finds that the contemplated activity at Hanauma Bay is not sufficiently expressive so as to 
receive protection under the First Amendment. See supra Section I."
1787,17," HN35[
] Like the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, this Court is of the view that the ""fundamental rights"" of the Privileges and Immunities Clause and those recognized in the context of the Fourteenth Amendment are not one and the same. Aldering v. 
Ohio High School Athletic Ass'n, 779 F.2d 315, 318 (6th Cir. 1985). The Court is not persuaded that all rights protected by the 
Fourteenth Amendment are necessarily ""fundamental"" for purposes of the Privileges and Immunities Clause. See id. (""we agree 
that the Privileges and Immunities Clause and Equal Protection Clause are not co-extensive""); but see Plts' (Privileges and 
Immunities) Opp. at 7 (citing Friedman v. Superior Court of Virginia, 822 F.2d 423, 426 (4th Cir. 1987), for the proposition that 
""the Privileges and Immunities Clause protects more than those rights which are considered fundamental individual rights 
protected by the Fourteenth Amendment"")."
1787,18," This, the second component of the right to travel is discussed infra with respect to Plaintiffs' argument that equality in access 
to Hanauma Bay is a fundamental Privileges and Immunities right. "
1788,19," The Court notes that Plaintiffs raise a similar and more lengthy argument in their Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, 
or Alternatively, for Partial Summary Judgment Regarding Plaintiffs' Claims for Violations of the Equal Protection Clause. See 
Plts' Opp. at 15-19."
1788,20," The circumstances of the instant case are exceptionally similar to that in Baldwin given the State's and City's efforts to 
preserve marine life and the ecological environment of Hanauma Bay. Compare HAW. ADMIN. R. § 13-28 (Hanauma Bay 
Marine Life Conservation District) withBaldwin, 436 U.S. at 373-376, 388 (discussing expense and administration of elk 
management programs). "
1789,21," HN40[
] Because ""a municipality is merely a political subdivision of the State from which its authority derives,"" a municipality's acts must comport with the Equal Protection Clause. City of Camden, 465 U.S. at 215."
1789,22," As previously discussed, Plaintiff Burgess' contemplated activity does not amount to constitutionally protected speech and 
association. See supra Section I."
1789,23," The Nunez Court analyzed the Plaintiffs' alleged deprivation of ""the fundamental right to freedom of expression"" apart from 
Equal Protection as a First Amendment overbreadth challenge. See  Nunez, 114 F.3d at 949-51. HN43[
] Arguably, the First Amendment's substantive guarantees provide the strongest protection for speech and expression-related association rights. See 
ROTUNDA AND NOWAK, 3 TREATISE ON CONSTITUTIONAL LAW § 18.40 (3d ed. 1999); see also  Orin v. Barclay, 272 F.3d 
1207, 1213 n.3 (9th Cir 2001) (treating Plaintiff's ""equal protection claim as subsumed by, and co-extensive with, his First 
Amendment claim"")."
1789,24," HN44[
] The Ninth Circuit regards infringement as effectuation of ""a genuinely significant deprivation."" Barber v. State of Hawaii, 42 F.3d 1185, 1197 (9th Cir. 1994) (""To infringe upon a fundamental right, the regulation must impose a penalty 
effecting a genuinely significant deprivation of the basic necessities of life or the denial of a fundamental political right.""). The 
Court notes that unlike the curfew ordinance in Nunez, ROH Sec. 10-2.11 does not affect Plaintiffs' ability to engage in First 
Amendment activity in any other public and private forum. "
1790,25," In concluding that elk hunting in Montana is not a fundamental Privileges and Immunities right, the Baldwin Court stated 
""Appellants do not--and cannot-contend that they are deprived of a means of a livelihood by the system or of access to any part 
of the State to which they may seek to travel.""Baldwin, 436 U.S. at 388. Additionally, in Nunez, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals 
cited United States v. Wheeler, 254 U.S. 281, 293, 65 L. Ed. 270, 41 S. Ct. 133 (1920), for the proposition that ""In all the states 
from the beginning down to the adoption of the Articles of Confederation the citizens thereof possessed the fundamental right, 
inherent in citizens of all free governments, peacefully to dwell within the limits of their respective states, to move at will from 
place to place therein, and to have free ingress thereto and egress therefrom."" See  Nunez, 114 F.3d at 944. Notably, the 
""continuing validity"" of the Wheeler decision was subsequently ""restricted to its own facts"" in United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 
745, 759 n.16, 16 L. Ed. 2d 239, 86 S. Ct. 1170 (1966)."
1790,26," The Constitutional source of this component of the right to travel is unclear. See  Saenz, 526 U.S. at 501 (""we need not 
identify the source of that particular right [right to ""free ingress and regress to and from neighboring States""] in the text of the 
Constitution"")."
1790,27," At the hearing, Plaintiffs argued that the right to travel on public roads is a fundamental right. Assuming arguendo that this is 
true, though Plaintiffs provide no direct authority, the Ninth Circuit clearly sanctions toll charges. See  Miller, 176 F.3d at 1205."
1790,28," Like Plaintiffs, the Court cannot discern the relevance of United States v. Clark, 195 F.3d 446 (9th Cir. 1999), to the issue at 
hand. Moreover, while Defendants correctly point out that Section 1983 enforces federally created rights, though the Court 
concludes for other reasons, it does not logically follow from this proposition that ""fundamental rights"" as recognized by the 
Equal Protection Clause are exclusively federal in nature. The Court notes that individuals who have been denied equal 
protection of the law (ie. establish an Equal Protection violation) may seek redress under Section 1983. See  Hoffman v. Halden, 
268 F.2d 280, 293 (9th Cir. 1959), reversed on other grounds, Cohen v. Norris, 300 F.2d 24 (9th Cir. 1962) (""HN47[
] an action "
1791,," based on § 1983 is not limited to deprivation of due process, but extends also to denial of equal protection""), French v. Heyne, 
547 F.2d 994, 997 (7th Cir. 1976)."
1791,29," In reaching this conclusion, the Court does not rely on Clark, cited by Defendants for the proposition that only fundamental 
federal rights trigger strict scrutiny. The Court is unaware of, and Plaintiffs do not proffer, any case in which a court looked to the 
traditions or law of an individual state in determining whether the right at stake was ""fundamental"" for Equal Protection purposes. "
1792,30," The Court notes that Defendants have not moved to dismiss or for partial summary judgment with respect to Count II 
(Violation of Hawaii Constitution). HN51[
] The Hawaii Supreme Court has recognized that Article I, section 2 of the Hawaii 
State Constitution secures for ""the people of Hawaii"" the ""enjoyment of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,"" which includes 
""the right of men to move from place to place, to walk in the fields in the country or on the streets of a city, to stand under open 
sky in a public park and enjoy the fresh air, to lie down on a public beach and enjoy an evening together, and the right to 
associate with others in the enjoyment of an avocation or a vocation."" State v. Shigematsu, 52 Haw. 604, 610, 483 P.2d 997 
(1971) (State Constitution guarantees to the people of Hawaii the freedom of movement); see also  State v. French, 77 Hawai'i 
222, 231, 883 P.2d 644 (1994). Other sources of Hawaii law also appear to secure similar rights for Hawaii residents. For 
example, the preamble to Hawaii's Public Access to Coastal and Inland Recreational Areas statute, which provides a 
mechanism for counties to purchase land to establish public rights-of-way to the shoreline and other recreational areas, see 
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 115-2, states that ""the absence of public access to Hawaii's shorelines and inland recreational areas 
constitutes an infringement upon the fundamental right of free movement in public space and access to and use of coastal and 
inland recreational areas."" Haw. Rev. Stat. § 115-1; S. REP. No. 841, at 12191 (1977) (""This bill would greatly increase the 
Department of Planning and Economic Development's efforts to assure the availability of, and accessibility to, adequate 
recreational, cultural and educational opportunities for the citizens of Hawaii.""). Additionally, in holding that private beachfront 
property begins at the vegetation line (the highest wash of the waves), the Hawaii Supreme Court noted that ""public policy … 
favors extending to public use and ownership as much of Hawaii's shoreline as is reasonably possible."" County of Hawaii v. 
Sotomura, 55 Haw. 176, 182, 517 P.2d 57 (1973)."
1792,31," The Court observes that some people may feel that charging non-residents a fee to access Hanauma Bay is not consistent 
with the ""aloha spirit."" Others may believe that such a charge hurts our tourist industry and is counterproductive. On the other 
hand, others may feel that residents have already contributed to support of Hanauma Bay through payment of taxes. Moreover, 
charging a higher fee to non-residents in numerous instances is a customary practice. Ultimately, this is a decision for the 
legislative branch (City Council or State Legislature) to decide, provided their decision meets the rational basis standard. "
1793,32," Defendants have not submitted any evidence that establishes that resident taxes (City and/ or State) go toward operation, 
maintenance and improvement of Hanauma Bay, and perhaps such matters as its access roads, bus service, water and 
electricity, ensuring safety (lifeguards), enforcement of game, conservation and boating laws, construction of new facilities, 
preservation of the marine life and ecosystem, provision of educational programs, controlling heavy visitor traffic, or that non-
residents present a greater threat of harm or are more burdensome on Hanauma Bay than residents are. Cf.  Baldwin, 436 U.S. 
at 389-91."
1793,33," Plaintiffs also argue in their Opposition that the residency distinction is not rational because ""only property owning residents of 
the City and County of Honolulu contribute to the City's general fund through tax revenue since the only tax to [sic] the City can 
legally collect is the real property tax, and yet all residents of the State are given free access to Hanauma Bay."" Plts' (Equal 
Protection) Opp. at 23. "
1794,34," In Count III (involving H.R.S. Section 7-1), Plaintiffs request that the Court declare ROH Sec. 10-2.11 invalid as well as award 
monetary damages for the ""irreparable injury"" suffered. See Plts' Compl. at P51-52."
1794,35," In the Kingdom of Hawaii, an ""ahupuaa"" referred to a parcel of land that ""generally ran from the sea to the mountains."" Kalipi v. 
Hawaiian Trust Co., 66 Haw. 1, 6, 656 P.2d 745 (1982). "
1795,36," The Court notes that subsection (d) of the ordinance provides: HN59[
] (d) Hawaiians entering the Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve to exercise their traditional and customary rights for 
subsistence, cultural and religious purposes shall be exempt from paying the fees established in subdivisions (a)(1) and/ or 
(a)(2) as the case may be; provided that nothing in this subsection shall be construed as allowing activities which may be 
otherwise prohibited by the Hawaii Revised Statutes or administrative rules of the department of land and natural 
resources. For purposes of this section, ""Hawaiian"" means the same as defined in HRS Section 11-1. HONOLULU REVISED ORDINANCES § 10-2.11 (d)."
1795,37," The Court notes that some of the plaintiffs in Akau v. Olohana Corp., 65 Haw. 383, 652 P.2d 1130 (1982), a case that held 
that ""a member of the public has standing to sue to enforce the rights of the public,"" were Hawaii residents who did not reside in 
the area where access was being sought and merely owned land nearby. Id. at 384. However, because Akau did not assess the 
requirements of H.R.S. Section 7-1 and because in that case the plaintiffs asserted numerous additional causes of action, 
Kalipi's interpretation of H.R.S. Section 7-1 is controlling. "
1796,38," HN63[
]  15 U.S.C. Section 45(a)(1) provides: ""Unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts of practices in or affecting commerce, are hereby declared unlawful."" 15 U.S.C.A. § 45(a)(1) (West 1997). "
1797,39," The Maki Court noted that ""HN69[
] while acting in their capacity as governmental instrumentalities they are, like the 
sovereign power itself, exempt from liability for acts done or omitted unless such liability is expressly created by statute."" Maki, 
33 Haw. at 173. However, municipalities are not always treated ""like the sovereign."" ""When they are acting not in their 
governmental capacity but in their municipal or corporate capacity, exercising powers and privileges given them for their own 
corporate benefit, they are held liable for their acts and omissions in exercising these powers."" Id. "
1798,40," The United States Supreme Court, in Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701, 97 S. Ct. 
690 (1977), cited by Plaintiffs, found that the treble damages provision of the Clayton Act serves both remedial and penal 
purposes. The Brunswick Court remarked: To answer that question [whether antitrust damages are available where the sole injury alleged is that competitors were 
continued in business, thereby denying respondents an anticipated increase in market shares] it is necessary to examine 
the antimerger and treble-damages provisions of the Clayton Act. Section 7 of the Act proscribes mergers whose effect 
""may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly."" It is, as we have observed many times, a 
prophylactic measure, intended ""primarily to arrest apprehended consequences of intercorporate relationships before those 
relationships could work their evil …."" Section 4, in contrast, is in essence a remedial provision. It provides treble damages to ""any person who shall be injured in 
his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws …."" Of course, treble damages also play an 
important role in penalizing wrongdoers and deterring wrongdoing, as we also have frequently observed. Id. at 485 (citations omitted) (emphasis added)."
1798,41," Palm Springs Medical Clinic, Inc. v. Desert Hospital, 628 F. Supp. 454 (C.D. Cal. 1986), cited by both parties, supports this 
conclusion. Although the case evaluates the scope of the 1984 Local Government Antitrust Act, codified at 15 U.S.C. §§ 34-36, 
which prohibits recovery of damages as against local governments, (the Federal Trade Commission Act, codified at 15 U.S.C. § 
41 et seq., not having a similar provision), the legislative history of the 1984 Act regarding the issue of treble damages is 
relevant here: ""Public policy, with respect to local government, is a different policy. Local governments are supported by 
taxpayers. If we allow treble damages against local governments the taxpayers are going to end up paying the bill for official 
actions by local governments."" Id. at 465 (citing 130 Cong. Rec. H12183 (statement of Rep. Seiberling). Notably, although the 
1984 Act outlaws recovery of damages against local governments, it does not completely immunize local government from the 
reach of federal antitrust law; injunctive relief is still available as against ""a local government [that] goes beyond its powers and 
tries to interfere with trade by activities in the private sector."" Id."
1798,42," The Court notes that HN74[
] Section 480-13(b)(1)'s provision for a $ 1,000 minimum recovery does not apply in a class action or a de facto class action lawsuit as per Section 480-13(c)(1). See Haw. Rev. Stat. § 480-13(c)(1) (Michie 2001 Supp.). "
1799,43," Plaintiffs argue that Defendants concede for purposes of this motion that imposition of the $ 3.00 fee ""is an unfair or deceptive 
act in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes § 480-2"" and that such concession is ""fatal"" because ""in order to be in violation, the 
act or practice must be in the conduct of any trade or commerce."" See Plts' Opp. at 1. While it is unclear to the court whether 
Defendants have conceded that the $ 3.00 fee is an ""unfair or deceptive act,"" see Defs' Mot. at 1-2 (""For the purposes of the 
instant Motion only, the following allegations are not in dispute: … 4. Plaintiffs allege that Defendant CITY AND COUNTY OF 
HONOLULU (""CITY"") violated Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 480 because: … c. Defendant CITY's imposition of the entrance 
fee on non-residents is an 'unfair or deceptive act' in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes § 480-2."") (emphasis added). 
However, even assuming that Defendants have conceded that the $ 3.00 fee is an ""unfair or deceptive act,"" the Court does not 
agree with Plaintiffs that Defendants have also conceded that the City's practice is ""in the conduct of any trade or commerce."" 
Although Defendants do not expressly refute Plaintiffs' accusation in their Reply, they have continuously maintained the position 
that the City does not engage in business activity. "
1806,1," ""Q: So in either case, from the perspective of another U.S. manufacturer of appliances, Latam was not available to serve as its 
distributor in Peru, is that correct? A: That may have been the case but there was no choice."" (Goldberg deposition at 154). "
1807,2," Skyview, supra, apparently did involve a theory similar to that which LATAM advances; in Skyview, an independent distributor 
alleged that the brewing company had encouraged it to overexpand, then terminated the distributorship and granted an 
exclusive distributorship to another distributor it had just formed, a substitution designed to impede the brewing company's 
competitors, and that did in fact harm competition. The district court had dismissed the complaint because it thought the 
allegations regarding any conspiracy between the brewing company and the distributor it formed to replace the plaintiff were 
insufficient; the Tenth Circuit, noting the standard on a motion to dismiss, held this to be error. See Skyview, 620 F.2d at 752. "
1808,3," LATAM's response to GE's motion to exclude the testimony of its proferred antitrust expert summarizes these effects as 
follows: Thus, Prof. Goldberg learned that: . Latam's imports for GE during 1996, its last ""non-impaired"" year, was 8,860 units, 64% of the U.S. exports in that 
year (Goldberg Table 1-2.) . nine U.S. manufacturers that were represented in Peru in the 1990's were no longer represented in 2000. . The total U.S. exports to Peru decreased during the 1996-2000 period, from 13,869 units in 1996 to 2,808 in 2000. 
(Goldberg Table 13-1) . The total Non-GE U.S. exports to Peru decreased 50% during the 1996-2000 period, from 5,009 units in 1996 to 
2,618 in 2000. (Goldberg Table 13-1) . three of the four distributors who had been exporting product into Peru in 1992 and were still doing so in 2000 had 
suffered some type of financial distress and reorganization during the 1996-2000 period (Goldberg Depo. at 63-64). . the U.S. exports from the three manufacturers served by these three distributors decreased a full 70% during the 
1996-2000 period, from 4,472 in 1996 to 1,345 in 2000. (Goldberg Table 13-1) . During the same four years the sales of the fourth manufacturer (Frigidaire), whose distributor had not failed, grew 
from 537 to 1,273 (Goldberg Table 13-1), indicating that a market still existed for such U.S. luxury niche goods if only 
they can reach Peru and ruling out the likelihood that the decline in the U.S. export trade was due to some the [sic] 
other overarching economic factors. Initially, it should be noted that some of these factors appear to support GE's contention that the U.S. export market for 
appliances to Peru remained competitive, rather than bolstering LATAM's assertion that the market suffered. For example, the 
third and fourth bullet points, regarding an alleged decrease in U.S. exports to Peru, when taken together, appear to reflect that 
GE exports to Peru decreased at a more substantial rate than non-GE exports. Further, the last bullet point, which reveals that 
Frigidaire's sales more than doubled during the relevant period, severely undercuts LATAM's theory of antitrust injury. LATAM's 
explanation that Frigidaire's distributor did not fail (thus facilitating the sales increase) explicitly contradicts its assertion of 
antitrust injury by virtue of other manufacturers' being deprived of LATAM's services. "
1809,4," LATAM simply cites its expert's conclusions that the effect on U.S. export trade caused by GE's alleged destruction of LATAM 
is ""direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable,"" without ample factual foundation. LATAM has not come close to alleging the 
type of substantial effect on a U.S. market that existed in Access Telecomm., Inc. v. MCI Telcomms. Corp., 197 F.3d 694 (5th 
Cir. 1999). Even were this court to have found that LATAM had met the antitrust injury requirement, the failure to cite or argue 
anything concrete in response to a motion for summary judgment on this requirement of the FTAIA would be fatal to LATAM's 
antitrust counterclaims. Without regard to the veracity of these alleged effects, argued by LATAM, see supra, LATAM has done 
nothing to show their directness, substantiality, or reasonable foreseeability with regard to the FTAIA. As to the second prong of the FTAIA, the parties disagree as to whether LATAM's alleged injuries must ""arise from"" 
anticompetitive effects on U.S. commerce. Compare  Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap As v. Heeremac Vof, 241 F.3d 420 (5th Cir. 
2001) (imposing such a requirement) with Kruman v. Christie's International PLC, 284 F.3d 384 (2nd Cir. 2002) (apparently 
declining to impose such a requirement). This court declines to resolve this question unnecessarily. The court notes, however, 
that LATAM mistakenly approaches this issue. First, it erroneously relies upon the tautological assertion of its expert, Goldberg, 
who says (without factual foundation), that ""the antitrust damage to the other US manufacturers is related to the destruction of 
Latam and in that sense it is very closely related. . . Latam's destruction prevented it from dealing with these other 
manufacturers, leading to the damage to the market. Now, Latam was damaged personally by this and it's all intertwined 
together with the antitrust and anticompetitive effects."" (Goldberg deposition, at 121-22). Secondly, LATAM is not claiming that the anticompetitive effects felt by U.S. appliance manufacturers gave rise to its injuries; 
rather, it is claiming that its destruction led to the anticompetitive effects -- the reduced ability of U.S. manufacturers to export 
their product to Peru. Thus, the case law cited by LATAM in an effort to show that it meets the Den Norske test is inapposite."
1809,5," GE challenges LATAM's definition of the relevant market in this case as the market for the export of U.S.-manufactured 
appliances for distribution in Peru, contending that LATAM has made no effort to determine which commodities are reasonably 
interchangeable by consumers, and, indeed, that LATAM ignores the fact that antitrust law condemns only that conduct which 
is harmful to consumers. GE cites case law in support of these arguments, and excerpts from the deposition of LATAM's expert 
in arguing that he ignores consumers in his definition of the relevant market. GE also contends that the market is competitive, 
which undercuts any assertion that GE possessed market power sufficient to control prices and exclude competition. In response to these arguments, LATAM states that its market definition is appropriate to this case, that GE's arguments are 
merely Daubert complaints about the methodology employed by LATAM's expert (Goldberg), and that these issues are more 
fully briefed in the Daubert pleadings. The court strongly condemns this tactic, whereby LATAM deflects its response to a motion 
for summary judgment to other pleadings (and thereby effectively increases the page limits therefor, despite this court's 
admonition in the past that no extensions of either page limits or deadlines would be granted). In an effort to give LATAM the 
benefit of the doubt, however, the court has reviewed the arguments contained in the Daubert motions regarding both GE and 
LATAM's antitrust experts. "

1823,8," These alleged violations of Puerto Rico's antitrust laws more or less parallel the violations of federal antitrust laws set forth in 
the Amended Complaint. The relevant sections of the Puerto Rico Monopoly Act invoked by DJM are patterned after their federal 
counterparts. We will, therefore, use federal antitrust case law as a guide in interpreting the Puerto Rico laws, especially given 
the dearth of Puerto Rico case law on these statutes. Therefore, unless otherwise specified, our analysis and application of 
federal antitrust case law and statutes to the facts and claims set forth by DJM will be equally applicable to its Puerto Rico 
Monopoly Act claims. See, e.g, See  Coastal Fuels of P.R. v. Caribbean Petroleum, 79 F.3d 182 (1st Cir. 1996)."
