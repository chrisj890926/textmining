16,"The California policy of course differs from policies of states with different statutory provisions.  Twenty states have ""right-to- work"" laws that prohibit union security contracts.  (See dissenting opinion herein, footnote 7.) Ten other states have statutes  specifically requiring that union security contracts be supported by a majority vote of the employees directly involved.  These  states, all except Hawaii cited in footnote 4 of the dissenting opinion herein, include Colorado (Rev. Stats. Â§ 80-5-6 (c), requiring  approval of three-quarters); Connecticut (Gen. Stats. Â§ 31-105 (5), 31-106(a)); Hawaii (1959 Session Laws, Act. 210, p. 141);  Idaho (Code, Â§ 44-107, 1959 Supp.); Kansas (Gen. Stat. Â§ 44-809 (4), also included in the 20 states with ""right-to-work"" laws  and not counted in these ten); Massachusetts (Ann. Laws, ch. 150A, Â§Â§ 4(3) and 5); Michigan (Stat. Ann. Â§ 17. 454 (15));  Minnesota (Stat. Ann. Â§Â§ 179.12 (3), 179.16 (1); New York (Laws Ann. ch. 31, Â§Â§ 704 (5) 705); Pennsylvania (Stats. Ann. tit. 43,  Â§Â§ 211.6 (1) (c), 211.7 (a)); and Wisconsin (Stat. Ann.  Â§ 111.06 (1) (c) ). Six states not otherwise accounted for and having only a  provision more or less similar to  section 923 of the California Labor Code  reach a result contrary to that of  Shafer v. Registered  Pharmacists Union, supra.  (Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, New Jersey, Washington and Wyoming.  See cases cited in footnote 4 of  the dissenting opinion herein.) Of the remaining thirteen states, six have no specific statutes and of these three (New Mexico,  Rhode Island, and West Virginia) support the majority view in this case while three (Ohio, Illinois, and perhaps New Hampshire)  support the dissent's view.  (See footnotes 6 and 8 of dissenting opinion herein.  The New Hampshire case is unclear as to  whether the union had majority support.  That it had some support from the employees is clear.  [ White Mt. Freezer Co.  v.   Murphy ]  78 N.H. 398 [101 A. 357, 358] .) Of the remaining seven states, six apparently have not passed on the point (Alaska,  Delaware, Maryland, Oklahoma, Vermont and Montana); and one (Oregon) has repealed its labor relations statute and not yet  enacted another (Ore. Laws, 1959, ch. 55, Â§ 1).  Thus, nine states without special statutes are opposed to the California  position.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

20,"Familiar rules for the guidance of a reviewing court in passing upon the question whether the evidence supports the  determination of the trier of fact that the situation presented to him does or does not constitute a law-defined operative fact (e.g.,  in Petri, the employer's interference with a union; in the next quoted opinion, an injury ""arising out of and in the course of  employment"") are stated in  Cardillo v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. (1947), 330 U.S. 469, 477-478 [67 S.Ct. 801, 806-807, 91 L.Ed.  1028] , as follows: ""In determining [whether the legally operative ultimate fact existed, the trier of fact] . . . must necessarily draw  an inference from what he has found to be the basic facts.  . . .  If supported by evidence and not inconsistent with the law, the . .  . inference [of the operative fact by the finder] . . . is conclusive.  No reviewing court can then set aside that inference because  the opposite one is thought to be more reasonable; nor can the opposite inference be substituted by the court because of a  belief that the one chosen by the [finder] . . . is factually questionable.  [Citations.] ""It matters not that the basic facts from which the [finder] . . . draws this inference are undisputed rather than controverted.   [Citation.] It is likewise immaterial that the facts permit the drawing of diverse inferences.  The [trier of fact] . . . alone is charged  with the duty of initially selecting the inference which seems most reasonable and his choice, if otherwise sustainable, may not  be disturbed by a reviewing court.  [Citation.] Moreover, the fact that the inference . . . involves an application of a broad  statutory term or phrase to a specific set of facts gives rise to no greater scope of judicial review.  [Citations.] Even if such an  inference be considered more legal than factual in nature, the reviewing court's function is exhausted when it becomes evident  that the [finder's] . . . choice has substantial roots in the evidence and is not forbidden by the law."" The foregoing rules are normally recognized and followed by this court as well as the high federal court.  (  Hamilton v. Pacific  Elec. Ry. Co. (1939), 12 Cal.2d 598, 602  [5] [ 86 P.2d 829] .)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,"The fact that the Petri opinion was filed less than nine months after Chavez brings to mind the protests of Mr. Justice Roberts in  Mahnich v. Southern S. S. Co. (1944), 321 U.S. 96, 112-113 [64 S.Ct. 455, 88 L.Ed. 561] : ""The evil resulting from overruling  earlier considered decisions must be evident.  In the present case, the court below naturally felt bound to follow and apply the  law as clearly announced by this court.  If litigants and lower federal courts are not to do so, the law becomes not a chart to  govern conduct but a game of chance; instead of settling rights and liabilities it unsettles them.  Counsel and parties will bring  and prosecute actions in the teeth of the decisions that such actions are not maintainable on the not improbable chance that the  asserted rule will be thrown overboard.  Defendants will not know whether to litigate or to settle for they will have no assurance  that a declared rule will be followed.  But the more deplorable consequence will inevitably be that the administration of justice will  fall into disrepute."" And again in  Smith v. Allwright (1944), 321 U.S. 649, 666, 669 [64 S.Ct. 757, 88 L.Ed. 987, 151 A.L.R. 1110] :  The ""policy of the court freely to disregard and to overrule considered decisions . . . indicates an intolerance for what those who  have composed this court in the past have conscientiously and deliberately concluded, and involves an assumption that  knowledge and wisdom reside in us which was denied to our predecessors.  . . . ""The reason for my concern is that the instant decision, overruling that announced about nine years ago, tends to bring  adjudications of this tribunal into the same class as a restricted railroad ticket, good for this day and train only.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,"Alabama: The following cases consider title 26, Code, Â§ 383 (""Every person shall be free to join or refrain from joining any labor  organization . . . and in the exercise of such freedom shall be free from interference"") prior to Alabama's enactment of a ""right-to- work"" statute: A closed or union shop was a lawful object of picketing where the picketing union represented a majority of the  employes (  Hotel & Restaurant Employees v. Greenwood (1947), 249 Ala. 265 [30 So.2d 696, 703  [12], 705 [17]]), but picketing  for such object by a minority union could be enjoined (  Klibanoff v. Tri-Cities Retail Cl.

Massachusetts: Ann. Laws, ch. 150A, is a comprehensive Labor Relations Act. The employer's compliance with a closed shop  agreement between the employer and one not certified as the representative of his employes pursuant to the act would be an  unfair labor practice and picketing to enforce such compliance can be enjoined. (  R. H. White Co. v. Murphy (1942), 310 Mass.  510 [38 N.E.2d 685, 690  [9, 10], 691].) Apart from the act closed shop agreements voluntarily made have ""always"" been  recognized and enforced.  But a strike for a closed shop ""is for an unlawful labor objective"" and peaceful picketing for such  purpose can be enjoined. (  Fashioncraft, Inc. v.

Minnesota: By Stats. Ann., ch. 179, as amended, a comprehensive labor relations statute, it is an unfair labor practice for an  employer to sign a closed shop contract without the consent of his employees (  Nemo v.

Colorado:  Section 6(2)(e) of the Labor  Peace Act (Rev. Stats., ch. 80, art. 5, Â§Â§ 1-22) made a strike vote by a majority of the  employes of the subject employer a condition precedent of picketing, and  section 7(2)  provided that the strike vote be taken ""as  is provided in this act."" These sections were held inoperative because the only provision in ""this act"" for a strike vote was in  section 20, which in turn was held unconstitutional because it required incorporation of unions.

Oregon: Rev. Stats., 1953, ch. 662, Â§Â§ .610 through .790, a comprehensive labor code, specifically provides (Â§ .750) that ""It  shall be unlawful for any person directly or indirectly to . . . coerce . . . any employee in the exercise of said employee's free  choice in selecting or rejecting a labor organization as the representative of employees for the purpose of collective bargaining,  or . . . to coerce . . . any employer or employee because employees of said employer . . . have not selected a labor organization  as their representative for said purpose.  The word 'coerce' includes picketing."" The constitutionality of this provision was upheld  in  Gilbertson v. Culinary Alliance & Bartenders' Union (1955), 204 Ore. 326 [282 P.2d 632, 652-653  [15-18]]. Pennsylvania: The state Labor Relations Act (Act of 1947, No. 484) provided that it is a union unfair labor practice for a labor  organization or employes ""To picket or cause to be picketed a place of employment by a person . . . who is not . . . an employee  . . . of the place of employment."" (Purdon's Stats. Ann., tit. 43, Â§ 211.6(2)(d).) This statute was held an unconstitutional restraint  on freedom of speech because its broad prohibition of picketing by nonemployes ""leaves room for no exceptions based upon the  lawfulness of the purpose of the picketing, its peaceful character, or the circumstances that the picketers have a legitimate  economic interest to advance thereby."" (  Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board v. Chester & Del. etc. Union (1949), 361 Pa. 246  [64 A.2d 834, 841  [3]].) Texas (which has a ""right-to-work"" law) also sought to narrowly restrict peaceful picketing by the following provisions of Vernon's  Ann. Civ. Stat., art. 5154f: ""It shall be unlawful for any person . . . to . . . participate in, aid or abet . . . secondary picketing . . . as  those terms are defined herein""; i.e., ""the act of establishing a picket . . . near the premises of any employer where no labor  dispute, as that term is defined in this Act, exists between such employer and his employees.  . . .  The term 'labor dispute' is  limited to . . . any controversy between an employer and the majority of his employees concerning wages, hours or conditions of  employment; provided that if any of the employees are members of a labor union, a controversy between such employer and a  majority of the employees belonging to such union, concerning wages, hours or conditions of employment, shall be deemed, as  to the employee members only of such union, a labor dispute within the meaning of this Act."" In  International Union of  Operating Engineers v. Cox (1949), 148 Tex. 42 [219 S.W.2d 787, 793  [10-12]], it was held that the foregoing statutory  definitions were so narrow as to constitute an unconstitutional deprivation of free speech, but the right to impose reasonable  restrictions on peaceful picketing was recognized.

27,"Rhode Island: The comprehensive state Labor Relations Act, Gen. Laws, tit. 28, ch. 7 (P. L. 1941, ch. 1066) resembles the  Wagner Act (pre-Taft-Hartley).  Section 28-7-2 thereof declares the public policy of self-organization and collective bargaining of  employes through representatives of their own choosing ""free from the interference, restraint or coercion of their employers"" (Â§  1) and provides that the act shall not be construed to diminish the right of employes to engage in ""lawful, concerted activities.""  According to  Lindsey Tavern v. Hotel & Restaurant Employees (1956), 85 R.I. 61 [125 A.2d 207, 209, 210  [4]], recognitional  picketing, ""unaccompanied by coercion, duress or intimidation, is lawful, . . . even if the picketing union represents no employees  of the complainant."" West Virginia:  Blossom Dairy Co. v. International Brotherhood (1942), 125 W.Va. 165 [23 S.E.2d 645, 649] , where no statute is  involved, holds (Syllabus 1 by the court, p. 646 of 23 S.E.2d) that ""Picketing of the place of business of an employer by a labor  union will not be enjoined on the ground that it tends, or is intended, to cause the breach of a labor contract between such  employer and another labor organization, when such picketing is not otherwise unlawful."" Nevada (prior to enactment in 1953 of a ""right-to-work"" law) may also be mentioned here:  State  ex rel.   Culinary v. Eighth  Judicial District Court (1949), 66 Nev. 166 [207 P.2d 990, 996-998  [10-12]], upheld the legality of picketing by an outside union  to compel a closed shop agreement under N.C.L., Â§ 10473 (enacted 1911), which provided that ""It shall be unlawful for any  person . . . to make . . . any agreement . . . by the terms of which any employee of such person, . . . or any person about to enter  the employ of such person, . . . as a condition for continuing or obtaining such employment, shall promise or agree not to  become or continue . . ., or . . . to become or continue a member of a labor organization,"" and N.C.L., Â§ 2825.31 (approved  1937), a statutory declaration of policy substantially identical with  section 923  of our Labor Code. Prior to its 1959 amendment  section 8 of the Labor  Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended ( 29 U.S.C. Â§ 158 ),  contained among the proscribed unfair labor practices (largely the same as those which, prior to the recent majority decision in  the Petri Cleaners case were proscribed in California by  Labor Code, section 923 , and related sections) the following which are  here pertinent: ""(b) It shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents: ""(1) to restrain or coerce (A) employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in  section 7  [i.e., rights to self-organization, to  bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, etc., and also to refrain from such activities except as the  latter right may be affected by a union security agreement as authorized in section 8(a)(3)] . . . ""(2) to cause or attempt to cause an employer to discriminate against an employee in violation of subsection (a)(3) [which  provides that it is an unfair labor practice for an employer to discriminate in regard to employment to encourage or discourage  membership in any labor organization, except that the employer can enter into a union security agreement as authorized by the  act] . . .

(C)  forcing . . . any employer to recognize or bargain with a particular labor organization as the representative of his employees if  another labor organization has been certified . . .""

(C) where the picketing has been conducted without a representation petition being filed with the board ""within a reasonable  period of time not to exceed thirty days from the commencement of such picketing,"" with some provisos. ""Nothing in this paragraph (7) shall be construed to permit any act which would otherwise be an unfair labor practice under this  section (8)(b)."" "" Section 13 provides: ""'Nothing in this Act, except as specifically provided for herein, shall be construed so as either to interfere with or impede or  diminish in any way the right to strike, or to affect the limitations or qualifications on that right.' 61 Stat. 151,  29 U.S.C.

On the record presented we are unable to evaluate the motions to dismiss granted by the trial court as to various defendants.   Our examination of the record available persuades us that in major part the motions were granted on the ground that plaintiffs  had consistently failed to allege factual matters with the particularity required to sustain a cause of action under the Cartwright  Act and other acts on which plaintiffs relied.  Accordingly, motions to dismiss all or portions of plaintiffs' fourth amended  complaint were granted as to various defendants on grounds which appear to be related to those for sustaining the general  demurrers. Although the instant record does not fully advise us of matters identical to those in  Lavine v. Jessup (1957) 48 Cal.2d  611 [311 P.2d 8] , plaintiffs assert that a ""duplicate situation"" exists.  The following observations from that case are pertinent  here: ""This case presents an unusual situation in that the court simultaneously sustained general demurrers without leave to  amend and granted motions to strike the complaint as sham and to dismiss the action.  The motions were not supported by  affidavits setting up any extrinsic matters and obviously were made upon the assumption that the complaint failed to state a  cause of action and was merely repetitious of prior complaints which had been ruled insufficient.  Defendants thus made their  challenge solely on the fact of the pleadings, and it seems clear that the questions presented by the motions were identically the  same as those presented by the demurrers, i.e., did the complaint state a cause of action and, if not, could the defects be cured  by amendment.  The normal method of resolving such issues in favor of a defendant is by ruling upon a demurrer and thereafter  rendering a judgment based upon the ruling.  It is, of course, unnecessary for the court, in addition, to grant a motion to dismiss.   As we have seen, the court subsequently signed and filed a judgment of dismissal which, after reciting that the demurrers had  been sustained and the motions had been granted, adjudged that the action be dismissed."" ( 48 Cal.2d at p. 614 .) As indicated,  the court equated the  Lavine  order granting the motion to dismiss with the order sustaining the general demurrer. [For the foregoing reasons we do not pass upon the merits of the motions to dismiss or the propriety of the orders thereon as  raising independent issues.]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

63,"There is no contention that defendant engaged in the practice defined in the complaint as ""bid shopping."" Although also a form  of price competition, bid shopping is less desirable than bid peddling because only the general contractor, and not the awarding  authority or the public, benefits from this practice.  Post-award bid shopping is prohibited in California on public works  construction projects by  Government Code section 4104 , which requires general contractors, at the time they submit their prime  bids, to list the names of the subcontractors whose bids were accepted in the computation of their prime bids. Thus, general  contractors are not free to solicit lower subbids once they have been awarded the prime contract.  (See Comment (1970)  supra ,  18 U.C.L.A. L.Rev. 389, 396, 402-404 .)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With reference to this paragraph of the contract, Telford Work, Secretary-Treasurer of the  Bureau, in his affidavit in support of the motion for summary judgment, states: ""Advertisers are of course free to go directly to the  newspaper and place their legal advertising as many do, just as any other members of the general public also do, and there is  no prohibition of any kind against this.

Paragraph Ninth provides for the annual pro-rata distributions of the Bureau's profits as discussed above. In its supplemental brief filed in this court, the Bureau, for the first time herein, contends that while the literal language of the  contract appears to dictate the total waiver of any right to profits as stated above, the actual practice has been to allow member  newspapers which have excluded certain classes of legal advertising from their contract to participate in the distribution of net  profits to the extent of the commissions they paid to the Bureau on nonexcluded classes.

81,"Defendants contend that Statewide has no standing to raise these claims because it does not compete with the Bureau and  has therefore suffered no injury as a result of whatever restrictions in trade the agreements may generate.  While it is true that  Statewide does not offer to represent newspapers in the same manner as the Bureau, our summation of the facts demonstrates  that in the area of publication of notices of trustee's sales; Statewide and the Bureau offer nearly identical services.  Since they  compete in the latter area, Statewide has standing to sue. The Bureau also claims that Statewide has suffered no injury because its members were never under any obligation to pay  commissions to Statewide. Statewide replies that the newspapers have a customary and quasicontractual duty to pay such  commissions.  These opposing arguments cannot be resolved on the basis of the declarations on file. A facsimile of the agreement has been attached as an exhibit to, and made a part of, the Bureau's declaration in support of its  motion as well as Statewide's declaration in opposition to the motion.  Thus, the terms of this document are undisputed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82,"The Bureau also contends that any restrictive effect arising from its agreements is caused by the legally sanctioned monopoly  held by newspapers qualified to publish legal advertisements. As we have seen, however, the restrictive effect flows from the  terms of the agreements themselves, and not from the statutes governing ""newspapers of general circulation"" within the  meaning of the Government Code.  (  Gov. Code, Â§Â§ 6000- 6078 .) The further argument that the contract provisions are justified because they allow the Bureau to act as a clearing house for legal  notices in the County of Los Angeles again presents a question of fact which should be determined at trial. Since we find that there are triable issues of fact as to whether the representation agreements are tying arrangements violative  of  sections 16720  and  16726 , we need not determine whether the agreements also independently violate  section 16727 .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,"However, we deem it unnecessary to determine whether this tying effect is sufficient to bring the agreement within the per se  rule established by the United States Supreme Court cases cited above.  Most cases involving tying arrangements have dealt  with situations where the seller absolutely refused to sell one product separately from another.  Here, there is no such refusal,  but a higher price is exacted for the tying product if the tied product is not also purchased.  Such an arrangement appears to  present many of the same evils inherent in a classic tying arrangement within the prohibition of  section 16726 .  (  Federal Trade  Com'n v.

In  Jones v. San Bernardino Real Estate Board (1959) 168 Cal.App.2d 661 [336 P.2d 606] , the Court of Appeal upheld a real  estate association's membership restriction similar to that in the case at bar.

The rule of reason has also been used to evaluate alleged group boycotts outside of the voluntary association context.  (See,  e.g.,  Dalmo Sales Co. v. Tysons Corner Regional Shopping Center (D.D.C. 1970) 308 F.Supp. 988  (action by department stores  excluding plaintiff appliance dealer from shopping center);  Savon Gas Stations Number Six, Inc. v. Shell Oil Company (4th Cir.  1962) 309 F.2d 306  (restrictive covenant in lease agreement between shopping center and oil company providing that center  would not lease to competitor of oil company).) Decisions applying the per se rule to associational noncoercive practices include the above-cited  Collins  v.  Main Line Board of  Realtors  (1973)  supra ,  304 A.2d 493 , and  Oates  v.  Eastern Bergen County Multiple List. Serv. Inc . (1971)  supra ,  273 A.2d 795 .  In  People v. Santa Clara Valley Bowling etc. Assn. (1965) 238 Cal.App.2d 225 [47 Cal.Rptr. 570] , the Court of Appeal labeled as  a per se violation a bowling proprietors' association rule providing that bowlers could compete in association tournaments only if  they bowled a certain number of league games in member houses.  The court found that such a rule was intended to coerce  bowlers into abandoning nonmember establishments and frequent those owned by members.   Silver v. New York Stock Exchange (1963) 373 U.S. 341 [10 L.Ed.2d 389, 83 S.Ct. 1246] , is also sometimes cited to show the  general applicability of the per se rule. In that case, two Texas over-the -counter brokers and dealers in securities arranged with  members of the New York Stock Exchange for direct telephone connections with a number of firms.  The exchange told the firms  to disconnect the telephones, substantially damaging the business of the Texans.  The court found that the Sherman Act was  violated, although its rationale is not entirely clear.  While the opinion begins with language indicating the finding of a per se  violation, the court then proceeds to examine and reject various justifications for the exchange's practice and also attacks the  lack of procedural due process granted the plaintiffs.  The latter part of the decision has led at least two commentators to  conclude that  Silver  applied the rule of reason. (Note,  Trade Association Exclusionary Practices: An Affirmative Role for the Rule  of Reason  (1966) 66 Colum.L.Rev. 1486, 1487-1488;  The Supreme Court, 1962 Term  (1963) 77 Harv.L.Rev. 62, 156.) Others",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96,"have interpreted  Silver  as a per se case, a circumstance which justifies the criticism of one writer that ""The judgment of history  must surely be that the courts and the legal profession have been far more successful in the results achieved in antitrust cases  than in their efforts to articulate the ideas involved."" (Rahl,  Per Se Rules and Boycotts Under the Sherman Act: Some  Reflections on the Klor's Case  (1959)  supra , 45 Va.L.Rev. 1165, 1168.) We recognize that in rejecting a per se rule in this case we are sacrificing some advantages, i.e., the facilitation of judicial  certainty and the saving of litigation costs.  (  Northern Pac. R. Co.  v.  United States  (1958)  supra ,  356 U.S. 1, 5 .) But the cost  need not be significant.  If a particular regulation is declared invalid under the rule of reason, both the courts and parties in a  future case may contemplate that a similar rule in a comparable industry having like economic effects will also be held invalid.   Adoption of the rule of reason does not preclude application of the doctrine of stare decisis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,"Although this case deals primarily with a salesman, we see no reason to distinguish between a salesman and a broker with  respect to the access rule.  Nonmember brokers, like nonmember salesmen, are of course denied access to the multiple listing  service and are thus injured by the rule to the same extent as salesmen. Moreover, the possible justifications for both rules --  insuring professional and ethical competence and preserving autonomy over provision of benefits and membership selection --  apply equally to both groups.  The only difference between the two groups is in the injury caused by the ""primarily engaged"" rule.   While part-time brokers are excluded from membership by a separate ""primarily engaged"" bylaw, such exclusion does not  prevent them from earning a living to the same extent that it reacts upon salesmen, who may not sell real estate unless  employed by a broker. It is not necessary for Palsson to prove that many brokers and salesmen have actually left the real estate field or declined to  enter because of failure to obtain membership. When, as in the present case, a practice has a tendency to restrain trade, it may  violate  antitrust law , ""whether it be 'wholly nascent or abortive on the one hand, or successful on the other.'""

105,"The representation agreement has been modified over the years several times.  With one exception (see  infra , fn. 4), these  modifications are not here relevant. Paragraph Eighth provides in relevant part: ""The BUREAU shall and it is hereby authorized to deduct, as compensation for its  services, fifteen (15%) per cent of all sums collected for the account of the PUBLISHER . . . .  In the event any sums are paid  directly to the PUBLISHER for any advertisements covered by this agreement, the PUBLISHER shall render a true and correct  account thereof to the BUREAU and shall pay to the BUREAU within thirty days after receipt of said sums, a sum equal to fifteen  (15%) per cent of the amount paid to the PUBLISHER.""

Paragraph Ninth provides for the annual pro rata distributions of the Bureau's  profits as discussed above. Following  Corwin I , the Bureau amended paragraph Second to state that if the member exercised its withdrawal right it waived  only that portion of the annual participation credit referable to the advertising withdrawn. Section 16720  provides in relevant part: ""A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more persons for any of the  following purposes: [para. ] (a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce.""  Section 16726  provides: ""Except as  provided in this chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void."" Statewide also argued at trial that paragraph Second itself was a tying arrangement constituting a per se violation of  sections  16720  and  16726 .

107,"In 1972 this provision was eliminated from the representation agreement.  (See fn. 4,  ante .) The trial court found that ""[throughout] the long history of the Bureau many members have excluded various kinds and classes  of advertising from the agreement.  The means of exclusion have varied -- some formal, others informal.  The evidence is clear  and convincing that no penalty of any kind whatsoever has been assessed by the Bureau or any of its members to any member  for excluding any class or classes of advertising from the agreement and that the annual participation credit has been paid to  each and every member of the Bureau regardless of whether that member had withdrawn or excluded any class or classes of  advertising from the agreement."" Moreover, as the trial court found, ""STATEWIDE never made any effort to represent any newspaper published by the  defendants in this case from 1966 to the present in the business of soliciting and servicing public notice advertising.  STATEWIDE was not forced to offer representation for all public notice advertising. The withdrawal clause in the Representation  Agreement permitted STATEWIDE to offer representation with regard to individual classes of such advertising."" Statewide also challenges the trial court's finding that the ""[relevant] geographic market is limited to the State of California"" and  that the ""relevant product is the services of a newspaper representative in the field of public notice advertising."" Statewide  argues that the relevant geographic market must be limited to the County of Los Angeles and that the relevant line of commerce  must be limited to notices of trustee's sales.  In  Corwin I  we explained that the definition of the relevant market or line of  commerce presents a question of law and fact.  ( 4 Cal.3d at p. 855 .) Statewide does not explain how the trial court's definition  fails as a matter of law.  Moreover, the trial court's finding is supported by substantial evidence on the record.  Although the  Bureau's membership is limited to the County of Los Angeles, over 40 percent of Statewide's files involved property located  outside Los Angeles.  As to ""relevant product,"" the evidence shows that Statewide neither attempted to represent newspapers  for trustee sale notices or public notice advertising generally nor performed any substantial services for the newspapers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
108,"Statewide relies in particular on our footnote 3, which states, ""In its supplemental brief filed in this court, the Bureau, for the  first time herein, contends that while the literal language of the contract appears to dictate the total waiver of any right to profits  as stated above, the actual practice has been to allow member newspapers which have excluded certain classes of legal  advertising from their contract to participate in the distribution of net profits to the extent of the commissions they paid to the  Bureau on nonexcluded classes.  Since no such facts appear in the record,  we cannot now consider this contention.  However,  to the extent that such facts are relevant, they may be proved at trial ."" (Italics added.) ( 4 Cal.3d at p. 849, fn. 3 .) The evidence presented at trial demonstrated that members could exclude classes of advertising from the agreement at any  time by letter or telephone call or even by a refusal to pay for a class of advertising. The 14 member-newspaper representatives  who testified at the trial stated that they knew about the withdrawal privilege.  Their testimony indicated that nearly all member  newspapers excluded at least one class of advertising from the agreement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
109,"Since  sections 16720  and  16726  of the Cartwright Act were patterned after the Sherman Act ( 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1 et seq. ), decisions  under the latter act apply to the former.  (  Corwin I, 4 Cal.3d at p. 852 .) Examples of per se violations include price fixing agreements (  U. S. v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. (1940) 310 U.S. 150 [84 L.Ed.  1129, 60 S.Ct. 811] ) and tying arrangements (  Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States (1958) 356 U.S. 1 [2 L.Ed.2d 545, 78 S.Ct.  514] ). Statewide makes no claim of a per se violation in this appeal. In sum, the trial court found that the Bureau was originally organized in response to the monopolization of the public notice  advertising business by a corporation which excluded community newspapers from the advertising. The underlying principle of  the Bureau since its creation, the trial court found, has been to help community newspapers compete for public notice  advertising. This policy, the trial court found, results in the publication of notices in the newspaper most likely to be effective.   The trial court concluded that the Bureau substantially benefits both the public and the newspaper industry. Moreover, the trial court found no evidence of any artificial barrier or restraint to competition.  Representatives of member  newspapers who testified at the trial stated that their agreement with the Bureau did not restrain them from dealing with  Statewide or any other independent organization.  Representatives of newspapers who did not pay Statewide a commission  testified without exception that they paid no commission because Statewide did not provide them with any valuable services, and  not because of any arrangement with the Bureau.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
110,"Indeed testimony at trial suggested that a newspaper could withdraw ""all advertising placed by Statewide"" from the  representation agreement. Particularly damaging to Statewide's case are the undisputed findings that, although Statewide knew of the withdrawal  provision of the representation agreement, it never proposed to any Bureau newspaper to serve as the newspaper's  representative for servicing trustee notices, and that Statewide did not perform any services for the newspapers. Because we affirm the judgment for defendants, it is unnecessary to consider the claim of defendant Copley Press, Inc., that it  was entitled to a dismissal because of plaintiffs' failure to serve notice to them within three years after the commencement of this  action.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rptr. 246] ,  which barred a Cartwright Act suit that attacked ""exclusivity"" clauses through which contracts for film distribution to defendant  television stations forbade marketing of the same films to other stations, including plaintiff's, within a 60-mile radius.  The Court  of Appeal concluded that the suit was foreclosed by the FCC's power over such arrangements in connection with its aims to  optimize use of broadcast channels ( 182 Cal. App. 2d at pp. 298-300 ; see  Nat. Broadcasting Co. v. U.S. (1943) 319 U.S. 190,  200-201, 214-220, 222-224 [87 L. Ed. 1344, 1354-1355, 1361-1367, 63 S.

That case preceded decisions that limited the preemptive effect of the Federal Communications Act (  Head v. New Mexico  Board of Examiners in Optometry (1963) 374 U.S. 424 [10 L. Ed. 2d 983, 83 S.

139,"The draft is a selection system whereby the respective NFL teams are awarded the initial rights to negotiate exclusively with  football players graduating from college. The option clause is a provision of the NFL Standard Player Contract which grants the team the right to renew a player's contract  for one additional year if the team and player cannot agree to a new contract.  After the option year expires, the player becomes  a ""free agent"" and may negotiate and contract with teams of another league or with other NFL teams subject to the Rozelle rule. The Rozelle rule is named after the NFL commissioner, Pete Rozelle.  This rule provides if a free agent contracts with another  NFL team, the new team must compensate the player's former team with draft choice(s) or other player contracts.  If the new  and former teams cannot agree as to the compensation, the commissioner arbitrates the matter and determines the  compensation. The tampering rule prohibits an NFL team from negotiating with a player currently under contract with another NFL team. Also, if  one team has the exclusive right to negotiate with a player, no other team may tamper with that player. The one-man rule refers to the commissioner's authority to compel a player to adhere to terms of an operative collective  bargaining agreement between the players and the NFL teams. This second collective bargaining agreement was negotiated during the pendency of antitrust suits brought by players against  the NFL.  The most significant case,  Alexander  v.  National Football League  (D.Minn. 1977) 1977-2 Trade Cases (CCH) para.  61,730, was a class action.  The agreement and  Alexander  incorporate a settlement which includes the practices and rules  Partee challenges.  The settlement also contains a covenant not to sue (in antitrust) by the class members.  However, Partee,  who filed this suit before the specified cutoff date, chose not to be a class member.  This agreement terminated in mid-1982.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
140,"As considered by the trial court in  Flood  v.  Kuhn , baseball's reserve system had many of the attributes of the NFL rules and  practices of which Partee complains.  Baseball's reserve system involved an agreement by all of the teams to be involved in a  draft creating exclusive bargaining rights in the club as to the draftee; a uniform player's contract empowering the signing club  unilaterally to renew a player's contract from year to year; denial of any right in a player, once signed, to negotiate with any other  team; a prescribed number of players per team; and the unilateral right of a team to assign the contract to another team.

141,"The dissent asserts that today's holding strikes a significant blow to the vitality of the Cartwright Act and that by this opinion ""we  would necessarily have to exempt all businesses engaged in multistate activities."" (Dis. opn. at pp. 389, 408.) This opinion has a  limited scope.  The Cartwright Act remains vital.  We do not mean to suggest that multistate activities of other businesses may  not be subject to state regulation upon due consideration of the commerce clause.

142,"Concur Dissent (U.S. Const., art. VI,  cl. 2 .) ""The Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate Commerce . . . among the several States . . . ."" (U.S.  Const., art. I, Â§ 8 ,  cl. 3 .)  The Supreme Court has explained: ""The Commerce Clause reaches, in the main, three categories of problems.  First, the use of  channels of interstate or foreign commerce which Congress deems are being misused, as, for example, the shipment of stolen  goods . . . or of persons who have been kidnapped . . . .  Second, protection of the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, as,  for example, the destruction of an aircraft . . . or persons or things in commerce, as, for example, thefts from interstate shipments  . . . .  Third, those activities affecting commerce."" (  Perez v. United States (1971) 402 U.S. 146, 150 [28 L.Ed.2d 686, 690, 91  S.Ct. 1357] .) We are here concerned with the third element of interstate commerce jurisdiction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
143,"""Consequently, it would be difficult to prove that a policy which removes privately instituted interferences, delays, interruptions,  and inconveniences with interstate commerce, is itself a delay, interference, interruption, and inconvenience to interstate  commerce when enforced at the local level by the States."" (Flynn, Federalism and State Antitrust Regulation (1964) at p. 84.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
145,"Pursuant to federal rules of procedure for class actions, a notice was sent to all class members, including Partee, concerning  the potential settlement. The settlement notice contained the following statement: ""Neither the covenant not to sue, nor the  dismissal with prejudice of this action shall prevent any member of the plaintiff class who duly commenced an individual action . .  . in any Federal  or State Court , prior to March 4, 1977, from pursuing such action to its lawful conclusion through trial and  appeal."" (Italics added.) The court found in favor of the Chargers on fraud and unpaid wages causes of action. The traditional preemption doctrine focuses on congressional intent.  Thus, state regulation is preempted if Congress  expresses a clear intent to reserve a field exclusively within its jurisdiction (see, e.g.,  Pennsylvania v. Nelson (1956) 350 U.S.  497 [100 L.Ed. 640, 76 S.Ct. 477] ;  Charleston & W.C. Railway v. Varnville Furniture Co. (1915) 237 U.S. 597 [59 L.Ed. 1137, 35  S.Ct. 715] ) or if such an intent can be inferred in a field dominated by pervasive federal regulation (see, e.g.,  Garner v.  Teamsters Union (1953) 346 U.S. 485 [98 L.Ed. 228, 74 S.Ct. 161] ;  Hines v. Davidowitz, supra, 312 U.S. 52 ). Conversely, in the  absence of congressional occupation of a field, a state may regulate the interstate aspects of an activity, even though the  regulation has some effect on interstate commerce. (See, e.g.,  Head v. New Mexico Board (1936) 374 U.S. 424 [10 L.Ed.2d  983, 83 S.Ct. 1759] ;  Huron Cement Co. v. Detroit (1960) 362 U.S. 440 [4 L.Ed.2d 852, 80 S.Ct. 813, 78 A.L.R.2d 1294] .)  However, even in this latter area, state laws which conflict with federal law may be preempted. (E.g.,  California v. Zook (1949)  336 U.S. 725 [93 L.Ed. 1005, 69 S.Ct. 841] ; but see  Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland (1978) 437 U.S. 117 [57 L.Ed.2d 91,  98 S.Ct. 2207] ;  Parker v. Brown (1943) 317 U.S. 341 [87 L.Ed. 315, 63 S.Ct. 307] .)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
146,"""The history of the Sherman Antitrust Act makes it clear that the Congress did not intend that the federal legislation preempt  parallel state efforts to control unfair competitive practices.  Before the enactment of the Sherman Act, some 21 states had  legislation proscribing 'combinations in restraint of trade.' Thus, it was not by accident that Congress did not use language in its  act that would expressly preclude state regulation though the activity possessed interstate qualities.  Senator Sherman, in urging  enactment of his bill, stated: 'This bill . . . has for its . . . object to invoke the aid of the courts of the United States to deal with the  combinations . . . when they affect injuriously our foreign and interstate commerce . . . and in this way to supplement the  enforcement of the established rules of the common and statute laws by the several states in dealing with combinations that  affect injuriously the industrial liberty of the citizens of those states.  It is to arm the federal courts within the limit of their  constitutional power  that they may cooperate with the state courts  in checking, curbing and controlling the most dangerous  combinations that now threaten the business, property, and trade of the people of the United States . . . .' (21 Cong. Rec. 2457  (1890).)"" (  R. E. Spriggs Co. v. Coors, supra, 37 Cal.App.3d at p. 660 , original italics, fn. omitted.) Thus, the fact that federal  antitrust enforcement has historically become the dominant force in the field does not in itself mean that state  antitrust law  is  displaced or preempted by the Sherman Act which, as noted, was passed for the purpose of supplementing state antitrust  enforcement by providing for more efficient regulation of anticompetitive interstate activities. Also relevant in this regard is the shared common law heritage of state and federal antitrust laws. (See Flynn, Federalism and  State Antitrust Regulation,  supra , at p. 90.) As this court stated in  Speegle v. Board of Fire Underwriters (1946) 29 Cal.2d 34, 44  [172 P.2d 867] : ""The Cartwright Act merely articulates in greater detail a public policy against restraint of trade that has long  been recognized at common law . . . ."" This policy is wholly in conformity with the purposes sought to be furthered by the  Sherman Act. (See, e.g.,  Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States (1958) 356 U.S. 1 [2 L.Ed.2d 545, 78 S.Ct. 514] ;  Apex Hosiery  Co. v. Leader (1940) 310 U.S. 469 [84 L.Ed. 1311, 60 S.Ct. 982, 128 A.L.R. 1044] .) Although some courts have employed supremacy clause preemption and commerce clause preclusion terminology  interchangeably, it is apparent that preclusion has been treated as a species of preemption.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
147,"Conversely, the reach of federal antitrust jurisdiction into intrastate activity, while generally expansive, is also limited by the  requirement that the impact of the local conduct on interstate commerce be more than incidental.  (See, e.g.,  Sun Valley  Disposal Co. v. Silver State Disposal Co. (9th Cir. 1969) 420 F.2d 341  [garbage collection];  Kallen v. Nexus Corp. (N.D.Ill. 1973)  353 F.Supp. 33  [bar review courses].) The boundaries in this area, however, are elusive.  The courts have disagreed as to what  type of activities are ""essentially local"" and thus not subject to federal intervention.  (Compare  United States v. Yellow Cab Co.  (1947) 332 U.S. 218, 230 [91 L.Ed. 2010, 2020, 67 S.Ct. 1560]  with  Times-Picayne v. United States (1953) 345 U.S. 594, 602,  fn. 11 [97 L.Ed. 1277, 1286, 73 S.Ct. 872] .) In  Allied Chemical, supra, 101 N.W.2d 133 , three out-of-state corporate defendants were charged with a price-fixing  conspiracy under the Wisconsin  antitrust law . Defendants had neither offices nor employees in the state; and prices were set  nationwide. Nonetheless, the court found them within the purview of the Wisconsin law.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
148,"As previously noted, some cases do appear to discuss preclusion and preemption interchangeably.  One example is  Alfred M.  Lewis, Inc.  v.  Warehousemen etc. Local No. 542,  supra, 163 Cal.App.2d 771 , which involved an agreement to restrict  competition.  The trial court had determined that the agreement ""would have been in violation of the Cartwright Act if it involved  'local businesses not engaged in interstate commerce,' but that because appellant [Lewis] was engaged in interstate commerce,  the laws of the United States apply."" (  Id., at p. 783 .) Lewis was ""engaged in interstate business, operating grocery stores in  many states."" (  Id., at p. 775 .) Thus, the issue of commerce clause preclusion was squarely raised.  The Court of Appeal  reversed, holding that the Sherman Act does not preempt the Cartwright Act since there is no conflict between the acts.  The  court also discussed commerce clause preclusion: it stated that, even assuming ""that the activities in question are within the  sphere of the commerce clause [,] . . . [the] fact that Congress has acted to prevent restraints on trade in commerce, of itself,  does not invalidate legislation by a state effecting the subtantially same result."" (  Id., at p. 788 .)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
149,"McHugh , the Massachusetts case cited by the Court of Appeal, makes the following pertinent observations in arguing against  a restricted role for state antitrust regulation: ""Monopolies and restraints of trade are of infinite form and variety . . . .  Some  expend their efforts almost wholly upon intrastate commerce and are of only local interest and some almost wholly upon  interstate commerce and so become matters of national concern, and there are all graduations in between.  In many cases it  would be very difficult to draw the line.  If State laws have no force as soon as interstate commerce begins to be affected, a very  large area will be fenced off in which the States will be practically helpless to protect their citizens without, so far as we can  perceive, any corresponding contribution to the national welfare . . . .  Especially is this true in view of the immense broadening  in the conception of interstate commerce in recent years."" ( 326 Mass. at p. 265 .) The final paragraph of the opinion states: ""The argument that the Sherman Act necessarily invalidates many state laws  regulating insurance we regard as [greatly] exaggerated."" ( 322 U.S. at p. 562 [88 L.Ed. at p. 1462 ].) In response to  South- Eastern , Congress enacted the McCarran-Ferguson Act which provides that federal law is only ""applicable to the business of  insurance to the extent that such business is not regulated by state law."" ((1945) 59 Stat. 33,  15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1011 ,  1012 .)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
150,"While  Speegle  relied on an antitrust case (  South-Eastern, supra ),  Coors  necessarily relied on commerce clause decisions  outside the field of antitrust because the Supreme Court, to my knowledge, has never specifically addressed itself to the  question of the outer limit of state antitrust regulation of interstate commerce. Nevertheless, in every case I have found that  raised the question factually, the high court has expressed a willingness to defer to state regulation. (See  Waters-Pierce Oil Co.  v.  Texas  (No. 1)  (1909) 212 U.S. 86 [53 L.Ed. 417, 29 S.Ct. 220] ;  Standard Oil Co. v. Tennessee (1910) 217 U.S. 413 [54 L.Ed.  817, 30 S.Ct. 543] ;  Straus v. Am. Publishers' Ass'n. (1913) 231 U.S. 222 [58 L.Ed. 192, 34 S.Ct. 84] ; cf.   Gibbs v. Buick (1939)  307 U.S. 66, 83 [83 L.Ed. 1111, 1121, 59 S.Ct. 725]  [Black, J., dis.]; see also  U.S. v. Underwriters Assn., supra 322 U.S. 533 .)  The early cases are of limited precedential value, however, since they only implicitly approved the application of state  antitrust  law , and also because these decisions were rendered in the era of strict adherence to the mechanical intrastate-interstate view  of the commerce clause. It appears that in these early cases the court perceived the activity in question as purely intrastate in  nature.  As an example, see  Standard Oil's  rejection of a contention that the Tennessee  antitrust law  constituted ""an  unreasonable constitutional interference with commerce among the States."" ( 217 U.S. at p. 419 [54 L.Ed. at p. 820 ].) Justice  Holmes responded: ""The mere fact that [the Tennessee act] may happen to remove an interference with commerce among the  States as well with the rest does not invalidate it.  It hardly would be an answer to an indictment for forgery that the instrument  forged was a foreign bill of lading, or for assault and battery that the person assaulted was engaged in peddling goods from  another State.  How far Congress could deal with such cases we need not consider, but certainly  there is nothing in the present  state of the law at least that excludes the States from a familiar exercise of their power ."" (  Id., at p. 422 [54 L.Ed. at p. 821 ],  italics added.) I note that commentators are ""overwhelmingly supportive of the extension of state antitrust regulation to include conduct and  practices that, while possessing a local nexus, nonetheless 'affect' or are 'in' interstate commerce."" (Rubin,  Rethinking State  Antitrust Enforcement  (1974) 26 U.Fla.L.Rev. 653, 670; see also Flynn, Federalism and State Antitrust Regulation,  supra , at pp.  56-108; Mosk,  State Antitrust Enforcement  (1962) 21 A.B.A., Antitrust Section 358; Note,  The Commerce Clause and State  Antitrust Enforcement  (1961) 61 Colum.L.Rev. 1469.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
151,"The lower courts accepted this inconsistent result, but they did so reluctantly.  One circuit court stated: ""We freely  acknowledge our belief that  Federal Baseball  was not one of Justice Holmes' happiest days, that the rationale of  Toolson  is  extremely dubious and that, to use the Supreme Court's own adjectives, the distinction between baseball and other professional  sports is 'unrealistic,' 'inconsistent' and 'illogical.' [Citation.] . . . However, . . . we continue to believe that the Supreme Court  should retain the exclusive privilege of overruling its own decisions . . . ."" (  Salerno v. American League of Prof. Baseball Clubs  (2d Cir. 1970) 429 F.2d 1003 , quoting  Radovich v. National Football League, supra, 352 U.S. at p. 452 [1 L.Ed.2d at p. 461 ].)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
153,"I note that the preemption holding alone is sufficient to dispose of the  Flood  case.  If state antitrust regulation is completely  preempted by the supremacy clause there is no need to weigh the state's interest in regulating the activity against the burden  imposed upon interstate commerce. Under a commerce clause analysis, state interference is presumed valid unless it unduly  burdens commerce; therefore, such analysis must be preceded by a judicial determination (or litigant's concession) that state  law is  not  preempted by the supremacy clause. In  Flood , the circuit court did not discuss supremacy clause preemption; nor did  it comment on the district court's preemption holding.  It might be argued, therefore, that the high court's affirmance of the district  court rendered the circuit court's commerce-clause-preclusion holding dictum, or that the court's affirmance of the circuit court is  itself dictum. The Supreme Court has sustained preemption challenges against state law in most cases where the ""national interest""  implicated is in the area of national security or labor policy, neither of which is in issue here.  (See, e.g.,  Hines v. Davidowitz,  supra, 312 U.S. 52 ;  Pennsylvania v. Nelson (1956) 350 U.S. 497 [100 L.Ed. 640, 76 S.Ct. 477] ;  Garner v. Teamsters Union  (1955) 346 U.S. 485 [98 L.Ed. 228, 74 S.Ct. 161] ;  Hill v. Florida (1945) 325 U.S. 538 [89 L.Ed. 1782, 65 S.Ct. 1373] .) Chief Justice Stone's statement in  Parker v. Brown, supra, 317 U.S. at page 351 [87 L.Ed. at p. 326 ], is particularly apt in this  regard: ""In a dual system of government in which, under the Constitution, the states are sovereign, save only as Congress may",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
154,"constitutionally subtract from their authority, an unexpressed purpose to nullify a state's [regulatory scheme] is not lightly to be  attributed to Congress."" I recognize of course that state and federal lower courts have held state antitrust laws inapplicable to various professional  sports. (See  State v. Milwaukee Braves, Inc. (1966) 31 Wis.2d 699, 719-732 [144 N.W.2d 1] , cert. den.   (1966) 385 U.S. 990 [17  L.Ed.2d 451, 87 S.Ct. 598] ;  Matuszak v. Houston Oilers (Tex.Civ.App. 1974) 515 S.W.2d 725 ;  Robertson v. National Basketball  Association (S.D.N.Y. 1975) 389 F.Supp. 867, 880-881 ;  HMC Management v. New Orleans Basketball Club (La.App. 1979) 375  So.2d 700, 706 , cert. den. (La. 1980)  379 So.2d 11 .) These authorities, however, are not controlling. In  Milwaukee Braves , a pre- Flood  case, Wisconsin brought an action against 10 baseball teams alleging that the league's  decision to move the Braves' franchise to Atlanta violated its state  antitrust law . In holding state law inapplicable, the majority  opinion obliquely stated that ""some members"" of the court believed state law was preempted under the supremacy clause while  ""other members"" preferred a commerce clause rationale.  In either event, the court makes clear that its decision was grounded  on baseball's unique ""history of judicial action and legislative inaction"" and the resulting ""conflict between state and federal  policy."" ( 31 Wis.2d at p. 721 .) Moreover, ""transfer of a team franchise is certainly distinguishable (particularly with regard to the  likelihood of state discrimination in favor of its own economic interests) from restraints imposed . . . upon players' freedom to  negotiate, . . ."" (  Flood, supra, 316 F.Supp. 271, 279 .) Similarly,  HMC Management  involved an attempt to keep the ""Jazz"" basketball team from moving from New Orleans.  Relying  on  Flood , the court held on preemption grounds that ""most of the violations that are alleged cannot be subject to Louisiana Anti- Trust Laws."" ( 375 So.2d at p. 706 .) The court held, however, that the alleged violation of a lease, if proven to be the result of  anticompetitive conspiracy, would be subject to the state law. (  Id., at p. 707 .) As I have explained, though, this court cannot,  absent an unambiguous Supreme Court directive to the contrary, limit our state  antitrust law  to purely intrastate activities. In  Matuszak , a football case, the Texas court simply quoted the circuit court's opinion in  Flood  and concluded, on ""federal pre- emption"" grounds and without analysis, that the circuit court's ""holding is applicable to the instant case . . . [therefore], the  question of whether Matuszak's contract violates federal law is a question for the Federal Courts."" ( 515 S.W.2d at pp. 728-729 .) Finally, in  Robertson  a federal district court found ""the opinion of the Court of Appeals [in  Flood ] unquestionably applicable and  controlling."" ( 389 F.Supp. at p. 880 .) The court held state antitrust regulation inapplicable to professional basketball because that  sport is in the ""'same business'"" as baseball, involving ""'substantial volumes of interstate . . . commerce.'"" (  Id., at p. 881 .). To the extent that  HMC Management, Matuszak  and  Robertson  held (either without analysis or in reliance on the virtually  identical league structures and interstate nature of professional sports) that state  antitrust law  is preempted or precluded, we  should decline to follow these cases.  In my view we should not decide the instant case on the basis of the organizational  similarities between professional football and baseball; rather, we should focus on the aberrant treatment historically accorded  the latter sport.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regarding rental units for which there was no periodic rent in effect on  that date, or during the six months preceding that date, the base rent ceiling is a ""good faith estimate"" of the median rent in effect  for comparable units in the City of Berkeley on May 31, 1980.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
194,"While the case was pending on appeal the Berkeley electorate enacted the ""Tenants' Rights Amendments Act of 1982,""  revising certain sections of the ordinance, including two sections relevant to our inquiry in this case: section 11, quoted  post  at  pages 687-689, footnote 44, and section 14, quoted  post  at page 693, footnote 54.  Although the amendment was not before the  trial court at the time it held the ordinance facially constitutional, any issues that may arise as a result of the amendments are  questions of law and thus may be properly resolved by this court in determining facial validity.  Therefore we will review the  regulation as amended. HN4 [ ] It is well settled that a court will consider on appeal a new point of law decided while the appeal is pending.  (  Claremont Imp. Club v. Buckingham (1948) 89 Cal.App.2d 32, 33 [200 P.2d 47] .) Although prior to  Boulder  there existed a  plausible basis for alleging a municipal regulation to be in conflict with antitrust laws pursuant to  City of Lafayette v. Louisiana  Power & Light Co. (1978) 435 U.S. 389 [55 L.Ed.2d 364, 98 S.Ct. 1123]  (discussed  post , pp. 658-659), that case involved  proprietary, rather than regulatory conduct, and hence such a claim could not reasonably have been expected to survive  demurrer.  In a real sense, therefore, the spectre of antitrust scrutiny of municipal regulatory conduct first arose in  Boulder . HN5 [ ] It is also established that on appeal from judgments granting or denying an injunction, the court applies the law that is  current at the time of the decision.  (  Cal-Dak Co. v. Sav-On Drugs, Inc. (1953) 40 Cal.2d 492, 496-497 [254 P.2d 497]   [congressional amendment of antitrust laws while appeal pending given effect to exempt a manufacturer from Sherman Act  Â§ 1   charges]; see also  M Restaurants, Inc. v. San Francisco Local Joint Exec. Bd. Culinary etc. Union (1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 666,  673 [177 Cal.Rptr. 690] .) Further, we have held that parties may advance new theories on appeal when the issue posed is  purely a question of law based on undisputed facts, and involves important questions of public policy.  (  Frink v. Prod (1982) 31  Cal.3d 166, 170 [181 Cal.Rptr. 893, 643 P.2d 476]  (plurality decision);  Carman v. Alvord (1982) 31 Cal.3d 318, 324 [182  Cal.Rptr. 506, 644 P.2d 192] ;  UFITEC, S.A. v.

In  Di  Grazia, supra , we rejected defendants' contention that because an issue regarding the rule against perpetuities had not been  raised at trial, it would be improper for this court to address the question on appeal.  Justice Tobriner, writing for the court,  suggested that defendants' contention was meritless, and that ""in any event, the issue as to the rule against perpetuities [is of]  considerable public interest; it has been fully argued before this court; we, accordingly, dispose of the issue on its merits."" ( 60  Cal.2d 525, 532, fn. 9 .) We believe that the validity of municipal rent controls under  antitrust law  raises extremely significant  issues of public policy and public interest.  (See, e.g., Goodrich,  The Limits of Municipal Power  (Mar. 1984) 4 Cal.Law. 26;  Spiegel,  Local Governments and the Terror of Antitrust  (1983) 69 A.B.A.J. 163.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plaintiffs in this case, however, do not seek a private remedy against  defendants; instead, they seek to enjoin enforcement of a local regulation alleged to be facially unconstitutional under the  supremacy clause.  It is clear that state courts may both construe and ""enforce"" the federal antitrust statutes for the purpose of  ruling on such facial attacks.  (  Rice v. Norman Williams Co.

196,"In  Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar (1975) 421 U.S. 773 [44 L.Ed.2d 572, 95 S.Ct. 2004] , the court held minimum fee schedules  for lawyers enforced by the state bar subject to scrutiny under the Act.  The state bar's status as an agent of the state supreme  court did not make its fee schedule ""state action"" because such anticompetitive conduct was not ""compelled by direction of the  State acting as a sovereign."" (  Id. at p. 791 [44 L.Ed.2d at p. 587 ].) The court again denied protection from antitrust scrutiny in  Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co. (1976) 428 U.S. 579 [49 L.Ed.2d 1141, 96 S.Ct. 3110] . In that case the state public utility  commission approved an anticompetitive tariff requiring the defendant to provide its customers ""free"" light bulbs.  Rejecting the  utility's argument that commission approval ""compelled"" it to operate the light bulb distribution program despite its  anticompetitive effects, the court held that mere approval was insufficient to invoke state action protection because it signified  only state neutrality toward the conduct in question.  (  Id. at p. 585 [49 L.Ed.2d at pp. 1146-1147 ].) In the following year, the court recognized state action protection in  Bates v. State Bar of Arizona (1977) 433 U.S. 350 [53  L.Ed.2d 810, 97 S.Ct. 2691] . In  Bates  the state supreme court, acting as the state's ultimate authority over the practice of law,  promulgated American Bar Association-sponsored disciplinary rules banning lawyer advertising.  The United States Supreme  Court held that ""[although] the State Bar plays a part in the enforcement of the rules, its role is completely defined by the court;  the [State Bar] acts as the agent of the court under its continuous supervision."" (  Id. at p. 361 [53 L.Ed.2d at p. 822 ].) The court  concluded that the state's anticompetitive policy was ""clearly and affirmatively expressed"" (  id. at p. 362 [53 L.Ed.2d at p. 822 ]),  and that the state bar's conduct was sufficiently compelled by the state to warrant protection from antitrust scrutiny.

(1978) 439 U.S. 96 [58 L.Ed.2d 361, 99 S.Ct. 403] , and  California Retail  Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc. (1980) 445 U.S. 97 [63 L.Ed.2d 233, 100 S.Ct. 937] , the court again addressed  the state action exemption as it applies to private business enterprises.  In  Orrin Fox  the court held that a state-imposed scheme  that restricted intrabrand competition in the sale of new automobiles was exempt from scrutiny under the antitrust laws because  the program operated under ""clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed"" legislative guidelines.  ( 439 U.S. at p. 109 [58  L.Ed.2d at p. 376 ].) In  Midcal , on the other hand, the court held that a state-imposed maximum resale price maintenance  system, affecting all wine producers and wholesalers in this state, was not exempt from antitrust laws. Although the scheme was  ""'clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy,'"" it was not ""'actively supervised' by the State itself."" ( 445 U.S. at  p. 105 [63 L.Ed.2d at p. 243 ], quoting  Lafayette, supra, 435 U.S. 389, 410 [55 L.Ed.2d 364, 381]  (plur. opn.).) Most recently, in  Hoover v. Ronwin (1984) 466 U.S. 558 [80 L.Ed.2d 590, 104 S.Ct. 1989] , the court, on a four-to-three vote,  found Arizona state bar examiners exempt from antitrust scrutiny.  The majority held the examiners' actions constituted action of  the sovereign itself, and hence exempt from antitrust scrutiny under  Parker  ( id . at p. -- [ 80 L.Ed.2d at p. 599, 104 S.Ct. at p.  1995 ]). Therefore, the majority found it unnecessary to consider whether the alleged anticompetitive policy was ""clearly  articulated"" or ""actively supervised.""

197,"Four justices dissenting, led by Justice Stewart, maintained that exemption applied because ""petitioners are governmental  bodies, not private persons, and their actions are '[acts] of government' which  Parker  v.

198,"Justice Rehnquist, writing for the dissent in  Boulder , correctly noted that the  Parker  court cast its decision in the language of  preemption.  (  Parker, supra, 317 U.S. 341, 351 [87 L.Ed. 315, 326] .)  Parker , which was a suit to enjoin enforcement of a state  statute, has been characterized by  Boulder  and  Lafayette , however, as establishing a state action exemption from antitrust laws.  ( 455 U.S. 40, 43 [70 L.Ed.2d 810, 814] ;  435 U.S. 389, 394 [55 L.Ed.2d 364, 371] .) Unlike  Parker , both of these latter cases were  private antitrust suits for damages, not invalidation of a regulation. In the court's most recent case in this area,  Rice  v.  Norman  Williams Co . (1982)  supra ,  458 U.S. 654 , the plaintiffs sought to enjoin enforcement of one of this state's liquor statutes.   Consistently with  Parker , the court framed its analysis in terms of preemption.  In view of these cases, we agree with plaintiffs  and amici that the question in the present appeal is whether defendants' regulation conflicts with, and hence is preempted by,  the Sherman Act.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
199,"In this regard, we must also reject defendants' attempt to distinguish  Boulder  on the ground that the city in that case stood to  acquire revenues from its franchise awards.  Again, it must be noted that the challenged activity in  Boulder  concerned not  collection of franchise fees, but merely the city's imposition, under its regulatory powers, of a three-month moratorium on  expansion of petitioner's franchise.  Nowhere in the court's majority, concurring, or dissenting opinions is it even suggested that  resolution of the case rested on defendants' ""revenue generating"" theory.  If in fact the United States Supreme Court had found  the city's apparent interest in collecting fees for its franchise awards to be determinative, we believe that court would have said  so somewhere in its opinion. Plaintiffs and amici argue that a local enactment is preempted by federal law not only when its operation would bring it  expressly within the federal statute, but also whenever its operation would frustrate the broad objectives that underlie federal  legislation.  (See  Hines v. Davidowitz (1941) 312 U.S. 52, 67 [85 L.Ed. 581, 586-587, 61 S.Ct. 399]  (the test of preemption is  whether the state law stands ""as an obstacle to the accomplishment . . . of the full purposes and objectives of Congress"").) See  generally, Posner,  The Proper Relationship Between State Regulation and the Federal Antitrust Laws  (1974) 49 N.Y.U.L.Rev.  693, 698-703 (suggesting that the federal policy of free and open competition can be applied to prevent the operation of state  law that clearly transgresses the ""spirit of the Sherman Act,"" ""even if the conflict is not within the express language of the federal  statute"").  We are not convinced that such a broad view is warranted or that the United States Supreme Court has embraced it.   Indeed, the court has recently indicated that it will not follow plaintiffs' approach: the court stated that ""[a] state statute is not pre- empted by the federal antitrust laws simply because the state scheme might have an anticompetitive effect"" (  Rice v. Norman  Williams Co., supra, 458 U.S. 654, 659 [73 L.Ed.2d 1042, 1049])  and suggested that it will invalidate state legislation in the  abstract ""only if it mandates . . .  a  violation  of the antitrust laws in all cases . . . ."" (  Id. at p. 661 [73 L.Ed.2d at p. 1051 ], italics  added.) Because it is necessary to prove the requisite concerted action and interstate commerce elements in order to prove a  violation of  section 1 , the court's statement must reasonably be construed to require proof of those elements even in a facial  attack such as this. It is therefore unnecessary to discuss either the ""intraenterprise"" or the  Noerr/Pennington  issues raised in the briefs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

204,"Likewise, it has long been recognized that courts are poorly suited to judge the reasonableness of prices set by businesses.  (  United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Ass'n (1897) 166 U.S. 290, 331-332 [41 L.Ed. 1007, 1024-1025, 17 S.Ct. 540] .) Surely, the ordinance at issue here is not a naked restraint of trade with no purpose except stifling of competition.  (See Note,  Crawling Out From Under Boulder  (1984) 34 Case Western Res. L.Rev. 303, 332-333.) In this regard, the dissent recognizes  that per se rules are inapplicable if the challenged restraint has ""any redeeming virtue"" ( post , p. 715;  Continental T. V., Inc. v.  GTE Sylvania Inc. (1977) 433 U.S. 36, 50 [53 L.Ed.2d 568, 580, 97 S.Ct. 2549] , quoting  Northern Pacific, supra, 356 U.S. at p. 5  [2 L.Ed.2d at p. 549 ]), but proceeds to ignore this established test, in favor of its own subjective inquiry into whether the  ordinance's anticompetitive effects ""override"" its redeeming virtue.  This unprecedented modification of  Northern Pacific-Sylvania   renders the dissent's analysis internally contradictory: at the same time the dissent recognizes the impropriety of balancing local  policy against antitrust policy ( post , p. 717), it plunges head-on to do just that by balancing a local policy's redeeming virtue  against its anticompetitive effects.  ( Post , p. 718.) Thus -- through the thinly veiled guise of its revised standard of review -- the  dissent would engage in the same  Lochner -type analysis that it purports to disclaim, in order to accomplish the desired result:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
205,"judicial veto of local economic regulation deemed to be unwise.  (Indeed, one need look no further than the titles of the dissent's  authorities to see that this is the ultimate objective.) Furthermore, even if the dissent might somehow be read to avoid such balancing, its analysis would be plainly circular.  In order  to determine that the per se rule of illegality of price fixing -- itself a presumption -- applies here, the dissent would apparently  create a foundational presumption that municipal price fixing lacks ""any redeeming virtue""; in other words, according to the  dissent, municipal price fixing is per se illegal because it is per se meritless.  This effectively guts the  Northern Pacific-Sylvania   holdings that presence of ""redeeming virtue"" renders per se analysis inapplicable.  Finally, the dissent's suggestion that failure to  apply a per se rule would somehow violate federal policy is curious at best.  The Sherman Act says nothing of per se rules.  The  per se rule is a procedural device created by the federal courts largely for their administrative convenience; it is not a substantive  rule of law.  (  Northern Pacific, supra, 356 U.S. at p. 5 [2 L.Ed.2d at p. 549 ];  Maricopa, supra, 457 U.S. at p. 344 [73 L.Ed.2d at  p. 58 ].) A state court violates no federal policy by declining to extend per se analysis to an unprecedented attack on municipal  regulation. A third possible justification for application of per se rules, closely related to the ease of administration justification, relates to  predictability.  This justification, in turn, assumes clearly defined judicial pronouncements on prohibited and permissible conduct  -- an assumption that has no basis with respect to the novel question of potential federal antitrust conflict with a municipality's  exercise of its police powers. For yet another reason, the per se rule is not applicable in this case.  The per se rule is itself dependent on the applicability of  the rule of reason. (E.g., Note,  Antitrust Standing, Antitrust Inquiry, and the Per Se Standard  (1984)  93 Yale L.J. 1309, 1311 .) As  noted above, the per se rule reflects an irrebuttable presumption that, if the court were to subject the conduct in question to a  full-blown inquiry, a violation would be found under the traditional rule of reason.  If, as we conclude below, the traditional rule of  reason must be modified or rejected in order to accommodate municipal defendants, it follows that traditional per se analysis  cannot be applied to those defendants.

For the same reason we decline to analyze municipal conduct under a so-called ""municipal rule of reason."" (See, e.g., James,  supra , 6 U.Ark. Little Rock L.J. at pp. 291-296 [proposing such an approach]; Comment,  supra , 35 Baylor L.Rev. at pp. 816-818  [same].) Whereas the rule of reason as presently formulated focuses solely on the policy of promoting competition (  Professional",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
207,"Engineers, supra ), recognition of a municipal public policy ""defense"" within the framework of the rule of reason would drastically  alter the nature of a court's rule of reason inquiry: a court would apparently be called on to balance the ""amount"" of  anticompetitive restraint against a municipality's interest in effectuating a desired local purpose.  If the rule of reason were so  modified, it would be no more than a means for judges to impose their own policy judgments on municipal actions.  (See  Boulder, supra, 455 U.S. at pp. 67-68 [70 L.Ed.2d at pp. 829-830 ], Rehnquist, J., dis.; Civiletti,  The Fallout from Community  Communications Co. v.

Marticorena,  supra , 9  Western St.U.L.Rev. at pp. 166-167.) We therefore reject a modified rule of reason; instead, we adopt a test that prevents  judicial second-guessing of local decisions to accomplish proper local purposes.  (See  post , pp. 675-676, fn. 28.) Certainly, official misconduct or conflict of interest should not be immune from condemnation under the antitrust laws. See  Note,  supra , 79 Colum.L.Rev. at page 538; compare, Cirace,  supra , 61 Tex.L.Rev. at page 498 (arguing that municipalities  should be exempt from antitrust scrutiny if (a) displacement of competition is no broader than the scope of the substantial market  failure, imperfection, or instability at which it is directed, and (b) implementation involves no official misconduct, discrimination, or  conflict of interest).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
208,"This formulation would not rest determination of permissible anticompetitive municipal conduct on findings that the local  government engaged in ""traditional,"" or ""integral"" functions, nor would an ordinance's validity turn on the distinction between  ""governmental"" as opposed to ""proprietary"" activities.  Framing permissible conduct in terms of a municipality's exercise of its  legitimate police powers, on the other hand, encompasses all local actions rationally related to promotion of local health, safety  and welfare.  ( Home Rule, supra , 49 Brooklyn L.Rev. at p. 294, fn. 191.) We recognize that this standard calls on courts to make difficult determinations as to whether proposed alternative means of  accomplishing a legitimate local purpose would do so (1) as effectively as the challenged means and (2) through means that  intrude less on the policies of the federal antitrust laws. Regardless of the difficulty of these determinations, however, this  standard is preferable to a so-called ""municipal rule of reason,"" because it would not require a court to balance competing -- and  often incommensurable -- policies.  (See  ante , pp. 673-674, fn. 25.) Instead, the standard we embrace today prevents judicial  second-guessing of legitimate local purposes.  However,  HN26 [ ] although a court may not invalidate local legislation by  balancing the propriety of (or need for) a legitimate local purpose against federal antitrust policies, a court may invalidate a  municipality's means of achieving a local policy if the local goal is sought to be advanced through discriminatory or irrational  means, or if it could be achieved as effectively by means that can be demonstrated to likely intrude less on federal antitrust  policies. This subdivision was amended in 1982 to limit the exemption to rental property divided into two units.  See  ante , page 654,  footnote 2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
209,"Although plaintiffs argue that any landlords so disposed would already have taken such measures because rental property of  four or fewer units was already exempt from rent control by the terms of a prior ordinance (the Temporary Rent Stabilization  Ordinance, passed by the Berkeley City Council eff. Dec. 30, 1979), this response ignores the fact that the ordinance now in  question is far more comprehensive than its recent predecessor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
210,"As a preliminary matter, we reject plaintiffs' procedural claim that it was improper for the court to grant judgment on the  pleadings because this denied them the opportunity to present evidence as to their claims of confiscation, denial of equal  protection, and unlawful restraint on alienation.  On a defense motion for judgment on the pleadings, all facts alleged in the  complaint are deemed admitted.  (  Sullivan v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 12 Cal.3d 710, 714, fn. 3 [117 Cal.Rptr. 241, 527  P.2d 865] ;  Colberg, Inc.  v.  State of California  ex rel.   Dept. Pub. Wks. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 408, 411-412 [62 Cal.Rptr. 401] .) There  was no need for plaintiffs to present any evidence.  Further, although they claim that judgment on the pleadings denied them a  declaration as to facial invalidity, the judgment expressly declared the ordinance ""valid on its face.""  HN30 [ ] It is well  established that a motion for judgment on the pleadings ""may be used in an action for declaratory relief to obtain a  declaratory  judgment on the merits in favor of the defendant  rather than a dismissal of the plaintiff's suit."" (4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed.  1971) Proceedings Without Trial, Â§ 161, p. 2817, italics in original.) Finally, although plaintiffs claim they should have been  granted leave to amend their complaint, any amendment to make further factual allegations would only be applicable to the claim  that the ordinance was invalid  as applied .  They were granted leave to amend as to this claim, but later dismissed the amended  complaint. In reality, defendants' ordinance employs two administrative standards for setting maximum rents. As discussed  post  at pages  687-689, section 11 provides for annual rent adjustment, but precludes the Board from granting such citywide rent adjustment  except to offset certain increases in general costs.  This is, in essence, a variation on the so-called ""maintenance of net  operating income,"" or ""cost passthrough"" approach.  (See Baar,  supra , 35 Rutgers L.Rev. at pp. 809-816.) Section 12,  subdivision (c), on the other hand, provides for individual rent increases based on ""all relevant factors, including (but not limited  to): . . . . (8) the landlord's rate of return on investment,"" as well as the landlord's costs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
211,"Whereas the return on investment standard determines ""just and reasonable return"" by focusing on the landlord's investment,  the return on value standard determines fair return by focusing on the market value of the landlord's property.  The fair return on  market value standard advocated by plaintiffs and amici was used by the United States Supreme Court in an early railroad rate  case,  Smyth v. Ames (1898) 169 U.S. 466 [42 L.Ed. 819, 18 S.Ct. 418] , decree mod.,  171 U.S. 361 [43 L.Ed. 197, 18 S.Ct. 888] ,  in which the court held that railroads were entitled to rates sufficient, after deducting reasonable operating expenses, to produce  a fair return on the fair market value of their assets.  ( 169 U.S. at p. 547 [42 L.Ed. at p. 849 ].) The Supreme Court later changed  its position, and approved use of an approach designed to ensure a fair return on investment.  (  Hope Gas, supra, 320 U.S. at  pp. 599-605 [88 L.Ed. at pp. 343-346 ]; see Siegel,  Understanding the Lochner Era: Lessons From the Controversy Over  Railroad and Utility Rate Regulation  (1984)  70 Va.L.Rev. 187, 215-259 .) Rejecting the idea that rates set by the Federal Power  Commission must be based on the present ""fair value"" of property, the  Hope Gas  court observed: ""[the] heart of the matter is  that rates cannot be made to depend upon 'fair value' when the value of the going enterprise depends on earnings under  whatever rates may be anticipated."" ( Id. at p. 601 [88 L.Ed. at p. 344 ].) Implicit in this statement is the suggestion that a return on  fair value standard is circular and unworkable.  ""Value"" is the current worth of future benefits that may be derived from an  investment.  The ""value"" of a utility company, for example, depends in part on the rates that the utility company may charge for  its product.  Thus, to set rates by reference to the company's ""value"" is a circular process.  (Siegel,  supra , 70 Va.L.Rev. at p. 246  & fn. 253.) The same circularity problem exists when fair market value concepts are applied in the rent control context.  (See  Helmsley v.  Borough of Fort Lee (1978) 78 N.J. 200 [394 A.2d 65, 71-72] ; Baar,  supra , 35 Rutgers L.Rev. at pp. 798-803;  Reasonable  Return Doctrine, supra , 33 Rutgers L.Rev.) ""Value is an expression of a building's potential capacity to generate rental income  and incidental or intangible benefits of ownership during its useful life."" ( Fair Return, supra , 12 Rutgers L.J. at p. 640.) The  current ""value"" of a rental property thus depends in large part on the amount of rental income the property is expected to  generate.  As in the utility rate cases, the process of using value to determine what rental income shall be permitted becomes  circular.  (Accord,  Cotati Alliance, supra , 148 Cal.App.3d 280, 287-289;  Palos Verdes Estates, supra, 142 Cal.App.3d 362, 370- 371 .) The  Cotati Alliance  court thus rejected a landlord's claim that a return on value standard is mandated for an ordinance to  be facially constitutional: ""The fatal flaw in the return on value standard is that income property most commonly is valued through  capitalization of its income.  Thus, the process of making individual rent adjustments on the basis of a return on value standard  is meaningless because it is inevitably circular: value is determined by rental income, the amount of which is in turn set  according to value.  Use of a return on value standard would thoroughly undermine rent control, since the use of uncontrolled  income potential to determine value would result in the same rents as those which would be charged in the absence of  regulation. Value (and hence rents) would increase in a never-ending spiral."" ( 148 Cal.App.3d at p. 287 ; accord,  Helmsley,  supra, 394 A.2d at pp. 71-72 ;  Niles v. Boston Rent Control Administrator (1978) 6 Mass.App. 135 [374 N.E.2d 296, 300-303] .) Amicus for plaintiffs suggests adoption of the ""public utility investment standard,"" which, it is urged, would result in a base rent  commensurate with the value of the regulated property at the time rent controls were imposed.  (Cf.   Southern Cal. Gas Co. v.  Public Utilities Com. (1979) 23 Cal.3d 470, 474 [153 Cal.Rptr. 10, 591 P.2d 34] .) Aside from the questionable propriety of  applying public utility law to the very different area of local regulation of private economic transactions, it has been observed that",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
212,"""if there was a housing shortage which caused rents to be artificially high, use of prerent control value as the measure [for  calculating fair return] will perpetuate artificially inflated rents. Rent control utilizing this standard is no rent control at all."" (  Cotati  Alliance, supra , 148 Cal.App.3d 280, 287.) As is apparently conceded by both parties, it would be premature and problematic for us to attempt to articulate, in the context  of this facial attack, the constitutional test against which specific applications of various administrative standards are to be  judged.  We will face that question when we review a challenge to rent control as applied to particular plaintiffs.  It is sufficient in  this case to measure defendants' fair return on investment standard against the general proposition that an administrative  standard must be such that it will permit those who administer it to avoid confiscatory results. On a similar point, we also wish to dispel suggestions based on dictum in  Birkenfeld  that we have previously established, as a  constitutional test, a requirement that rent controls must provide landlords a ""just and reasonable return on their property."" ( 17  Cal.3d at p. 165 .) This statement was made in the context of a broader discussion of the legitimate exercise of local police  power, and was most certainly not intended to articulate a constitutional standard.   Birkenfeld's  reference to the term ""property""  should therefore be viewed with caution; it would be inappropriate to suggest that the  Birkenfeld  statement can be used to  predict the specific constitutional standard that we will articulate when we review a challenge to rent control as applied. Plaintiffs demonstrate this point by the following hypothetical: In May of 1980, a landlord's gross rental income is $ 10,000; his  operating expenses total $ 9,000, as follows: mortgage payment of $ 6,000; property taxes of $ 1,000; utility bills of $ 2,000.   Thus his net return (profit) is $ 1,000.  In May of 1982 his expenses remain the same except that utility costs increase by $ 500  to $ 1,500, thereby reducing his net return to $ 500.  Under these circumstances the section 11 annual general adjustment  mechanism allows the Board to provide for a 5 percent increase in rent, to $ 10,500, so that the landlord's profit amount would  be the same number of dollars ($ 1,000) as it was two years earlier.  However, no relief is or can be provided under section 11  for the erosionary effect of two years of inflation on the $ 1,000 base income, the purchasing power of which has been  diminished. The ""effect of inflation"" issue was apparently raised for the first time at oral argument in the Court of Appeal.  On July 21, 1983,  the appellate court vacated submission of the case in order to receive defendants' written concession of July 5, 1983, that the  term ""fair return on investment"" in section 12, subdivisions (c) and (i), may reasonably be interpreted to permit the Board to  consider and allow for any decrease in the purchasing power of the landlord's return caused by inflation.  Both the court's order  and defendants' letter, as well as plaintiffs' response thereto, are part of the record before us on appeal.  The issue has been  briefed and responses have been filed. Plaintiffs' point can best be explained by a hypothetical example.  Assuming that the Board were to fix a ""fair return on  investment"" at 10 percent for all landlords, the following might occur: Recent investor A has invested $ 70,000 since 1979, and  he earned a profit of $ 6,000 in 1980.  In 1984 he petitions the Board under section 12 for an increase in his return on",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
213,"investment.  Under its 10 percent return on investment standard, the Board may grant A an increase of $ 1,000, so that his 1984  amount of profit is $ 7,000.  Additional contributions to capital could, of course, also yield a 10 percent return. In contrast, long-term investor B has invested $ 40,000 since 1950, and he, too, earned a profit of $ 6,000 in 1980.  However,  when in 1984 he petitions the Board under section 12 for an increase in his return on investment, he will be turned down if the  Board mechanically multiplies his $ 40,000 investment by a 10 percent return.  Hence, B would be limited to his frozen May 1980  amount of return -- $ 6,000.  Only if (as plaintiffs suggest is mandatory) the Board takes into account the effect of inflation on his  investment, and ""adjusts"" his investment figure accordingly, or if (as Â§ 12, subd. (c)(8), seems to allow (see  post , p. 683, fn. 39))  the Board assigns him a higher rate of return, may he secure an increase in the amount of profit he received in 1980. For example, nothing in the ordinance precludes the Board from adjusting the rate (percentage) of return on investment in  order to increase a landlord's amount of profit.  Indeed, the ordinance seems to contemplate ad hoc adjustment of individual  landlord's rates of return in order to reach this result: section 12, subdivision (c)(8), provides that in making individual  adjustments the Board shall consider ""[the] landlord's  rate  of return on investment."" (Italics added.) See section 12, subdivision  (c), set out  post , page 689, footnote 46. Nothing in the ordinance requires the Board to fix a landlord's return based only on his ""actual"" investment.  Further, although  section 12, subdivision (c), contains a list of ""relevant factors"" to be considered by the Board in determining the appropriate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
214,"amount of a landlord's rents, these factors are expressly nonexclusive.  And perhaps most significant, subsection (8) of  subdivision (c), permits the Board to consider ""all relevant factors"" in determining the ""landlord's rate of return on investment.""  See section 12, subdivision (c), set out  post  at page 689, footnote 46. We read  Cotati Alliance  to be consistent with our determination today.  That case merely suggests that a rent board "" may ""  consider the effect of inflation if doing so is necessary to assure a landlord a fair return, and hence avoid a confiscatory result, in  a specific case.  ( 148 Cal.App.3d at p. 289 .) See section 12, subdivisions (d) and (e), set out  post , page 692, footnote 53. The court further noted: ""[landlords] also argue that the ordinance unfairly denies long-time landlords any appreciation from the  time of acquisition to the date when rents were first controlled, but the ordinance did not  reduce  rents when it was enacted, and  thus, did not affect preordinance appreciation.""

Another exception is presented by an automatic appeal from a judgment imposing a penalty of death.  In an automatic appeal,  this court has a statutory duty to examine the complete record to determine whether the defendant was given a fair trial.  (  People v. Stanworth (1969) 71 Cal.2d 820, 833 [80 Cal.Rptr. 49, 457 P.2d 889] ;  Pen. Code, Â§ 1239, subd. (b) .) Accordingly, an  amicus will be permitted to raise a new issue bearing on that question.  (  People v. Easley (1983) 34 Cal.3d 858, 863-864 [196  Cal.Rptr. 309, 671 P.2d 813]  [rehearing granted to consider issues raised by amicus curiae after initial decision filed but before  the opinion became final].) In this respect, the problem presented here differs from the one confronting the Court of Appeal in  Younger .  With certain  exceptions, this court has discretion as to which cases it will hear.  The Courts of Appeal, again with minor exceptions, must rule  on all duly filed appeals from final judgments and appealable orders.  (See  Cal. Const., art.  VI, Â§Â§ 11 ,  12 ; Cal. Rules of Court,  rules 28, 29;  Code Civ. Proc., Â§ 901 et seq. ;  6  Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Appeal, Â§ 30, p. 4045.) Hence, this court has  an additional basis for insisting upon timely notification of the issues posed by an appeal. On May 6, 1985, this particular problem will be lessened considerably when a recently approved amendment to the California  Constitution takes effect.  ( Cal. Const., art. VI, Â§ 12 , as adopted Nov. 6, 1984.)

Other examples abound.  (See, e.g.,  United States v. Exxon Corp. (D.D.C. 1983) 561 F.Supp. 816, 856-857 , affd. in relevant part (T.E.C.A. 1985)  773 F.2d 1240 , pp.  1280-1287 [recovery in oil overcharge case paid to the United States Treasury for future distribution to states for use in state and  federal energy conservation and related programs]; see generally, 3 Newberg, Class Actions,  supra , Â§ 4620, p. 86.) Some commentators have suggested that the benefits of earmarked escheat may be diluted since there is nothing to prevent  the Legislature from reducing appropriations to the recipient agency by the amount of the damage award.  (See, e.g., Durand,  An Economic Analysis of Fluid Class Recovery Mechanisms  (1981) 34 Stan.L.Rev. 173, 180-181 [hereafter  Economic  Analysis ].) However, earmarked escheats can be conditioned on the state's promise not to divert previously budgeted funds.   (See  Cy Pres Remedy, supra , 39 U.Chi. L.Rev. at p. 458, fn. 42.) Though the court's ability to enforce such conditions may be  limited, there is no reason to assume that the state would act in bad faith.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
274,"Of course, a court considering the allocation of funds to an existing private body must be mindful of possible conflicts of  interest.  An organization seeking the right to administer class funds may view a large recovery as a pot of gold to fund projects  ranked high on the group's own agenda but of little or no benefit to the class.  Trial courts are frequently called upon to make  similar assessments when deciding whether a plaintiff seeking to maintain an action on behalf of a class will fairly and  adequately represent the interests of all members of the class.  (See 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Pleading, Â§Â§ 207-  209, pp. 245-248.) Where such a conflict is identified, earmarked escheat or the creation of a new body to administer the  consumer trust fund may provide suitable alternatives. Claimant fund sharing can be used as a method for distributing the residue -- that portion of the fund that remains after class  members have proved their actual damages.  It also can be employed, as here, to distribute the entire fund to individual  claimants on a pro-rata basis.  Had distribution in this case not been delayed by the appellate process, the class fund would  have been distributed pro-rata, leaving little if any residue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
275,"The reserve role of the  parens patriae  action is readily apparent from the fact that it, unlike the private class action, does not  provide for the recovery of treble damages.  ( Â§ 16760, subd. (a)(2) ;  Â§ 16750, subd. (a) .) This conclusion is in no way altered where, as here, the two types of action are brought together and settled together.  To hold  otherwise would penalize the Attorney General and the class for employing the  parens patriae  action in its intended role as a  backup for private class actions.  In view of this conclusion, it is not necessary to decide whether the  parens patriae  statute",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
276,"operates retroactively to cover this action.  The alleged violations occurred in 1972-1976.   Section 16760  was enacted in 1977.   (Stats. 1977, ch. 543, Â§ 1, p. 1747.) By contrast, the statute's approach is consistent with the character of the  parens patriae  action, which is less concerned with  compensation.  ""The most reasonable interpretation of  section 16760, subdivision (e)  is that the Legislature has sanctioned the  use of a civil action by the Attorney General . . . regardless of the compensatory effect of the action.""

The class notice stated: ""If you wish to object to the settlement, you must file a  notice of intention to appear and state all of the reasons you object to the proposed settlement in writing by April 6, 1981.""

We also note that plaintiffs do not argue that private insurance rates are  actually ""excessive"" in violation of  Insurance Code section 1852 .  Plaintiffs assert that even if the Commissioner and various  insurers had been joined as defendants, and even if we found plaintiffs' legal propositions persuasive, we would be without  power to remedy the situation through a decree directed at the Commissioner or any insurer.

They do strongly maintain, however,  that private insurers do not constitute an arm of the state, and their acts are not ""state acts"" cognizable under the  Fourteenth  Amendment to the United States Constitution  or  article I, section 7 of the California Constitution . We note that the statistics quoted by plaintiffs as establishing the number of citations issued under the 1984 Act prior to the  trial court's hearing did not differentiate between those who could not afford or could not obtain insurance, and those who simply  would not buy it even if they could afford it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
297,"However, unlike California, Michigan required that all insurance rates be approved by its insurance commissioner. See  Gay Law Students Assn. v. Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co. (1979) 24 Cal.3d 458 [156 Cal. Rptr. 14, 595 P.2d 592] . In  Gay Law  Students , we found that a public utility is more akin to a governmental entity than a purely private employer.  As factors leading  to that conclusion, we noted the following: ""[Breadth] and depth"" of governmental regulation; a regulatory framework establishing  that the state ""expects"" a utility to act like a governmental entity, not a private corporation; the fact that the prices charged for the  utility and the standards of the facilities were determined by the state; the endowment of the utility with a number of the state's  sovereign powers; the guaranteed monopoly status of the utility; the guaranteed return on investment; and the public's need to  purchase the monopolistic utility's product.  (  Id. at pp. 469-472 .) Insurance companies might possess only the last of the  foregoing attributes: the public's need to buy the product.  Without more, that does not approach the situation described in  Gay  Law Students .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
298,"Plaintiffs have conceded that if after a due process hearing the same rates were approved as are now in effect, they would  have no remedy. We did not reach this issue in  Watson, supra, 212 Cal. 279 , which concerned a substantive due process challenge to the  financial responsibility laws, and plaintiffs do not quarrel with the result in that case. Plaintiffs cite  Applebaum v. Board of Directors (1980) 104 Cal. App. 3d 648, 657 [163 Cal. Rptr. 831] , for the proposition that  private enterprises affected with a public interest must provide ""fair procedures,"" a notion akin to due process.  However, that  case and the law review article upon which it relies make it clear that ""fair procedures"" extend only to membership decisions of  work-related entities, such as unions or professional organizations.  The only exception is that the doctrine has been extended to  a hospital's decisions concerning a doctor's staff privileges.  (Sloss & Becker,  The Organization Affected With a Public Interest  and Its Members -- Justice Tobriner's Contribution to Evolving Common Law Doctrine  (1977) 29 Hastings L.J. 99.)  Applebaum   has no application to this case. We note, though, that there is certainly no ""statutory presumption"" in California that CAARP rates are higher than those in the  voluntary market, in contrast to the described situation in Michigan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
299,"In his March 20, 1986, decision, the Commissioner explained that a recent change in the CAARP regulations was designed ""to  double the premium surcharges [of drivers with points] in order to place the increasing costs of liability insurance on the  negligent automobile operator who has documented traffic violations.  This change is also necessary to reflect inflation because  these fixed surcharges haven't been changed in past years when the base rates were increased."" This explanation takes into  account much of plaintiffs' concern.  Before these changes were adopted, base rates, paid by all CAARP insureds, increased  although the dollar differentiation between ""good"" and ""bad"" drivers remained constant.  In effect, the percentage differential  between such drivers decreased each time that the base rates increased.  The prior $ 200 spread between the best and worst  drivers did not fully reflect the actuarial difference in the cost of insurance between them.  Hence, plaintiffs were correct in  asserting that good drivers in CAARP subsidized bad drivers. That concern now has less persuasive force. As plaintiffs have not filed a complaint with the Commissioner, nor joined him in the present case, we cannot determine  whether the rates are actually excessive. We note, though, that such a claim was made in a complaint filed with the  Commissioner by the County of Los Angeles.  Plaintiffs here are, of course, also free to file a complaint.  As stated previously,  the Commissioner's final determination is subject to judicial review. One plaintiff, in his declaration, states that he believes it is ""unfair"" for him to be placed in CAARP, where he claims he is  ""lumped with bad drivers,"" just because of where he lives.  This argument was not set forth in plaintiffs' brief as evidence of  ""stigmatization."" Moreover, as plaintiffs themselves point out, 35 percent of those insured through CAARP are good drivers.  Given the differentiation in rates based on driving record, and the foregoing statistic, it cannot be said that this declaration, if  true, establishes stigmatization. Plaintiffs expressly concede for purposes of this suit the procedural due process adequacy of the CAARP rate-setting  procedures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

301,"Concur In  Shavers v. Kelley (1978) 402 Mich. 554 [267 N.W.2d. 72] , the Michigan Supreme Court held that ""[motorists] are  constitutionally entitled to have . . . insurance made available on a fair and equitable basis."" Every state which has enacted compulsory automobile insurance laws (whether liability insurance or no fault insurance) has  also enacted procedures for review of private insurance rates, an assigned risk program, or both.  Most states go further,  requiring advance approval of insurance rates by an insurance commissioner or board, but there appear to be none which do not  recognize the obligation to make sure that insurance is available to those required to possess it. This claim, while plausible on its face, may be historically inaccurate.  According to  Cal. State Auto. etc. Bureau v. Downey  (1950) 96 Cal. App. 2d 876, 880-881 [216 P.2d 882] , the impetus for the current assigned risk program was the refusal of  insurance companies to insure small trucking companies regardless of their accident record.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
302,"The other forms of proof may be found in  Vehicle Code sections 16053  (certificate of self insurance); 16054 (insurance policy  or bond); 16054.2, subdivision (a) (cash deposit of $ 50,000 with the DMV).  The certificate of self insurance can only be issued  to fleet owners of more than 25 vehicles.  ( Â§ 16053, subd. (a) .) The bond mentioned in section 16054, subdivision (a) is not in  fact sold by any surety in the state.  It is self-evident that a person who cannot afford to pay the several hundred dollars required  for minimum liability insurance is equally unable to deposit $ 50,000 in cash with the DMV as required by section 16054.2,  subdivision (a).  Accordingly, purchase of an automobile insurance liability policy is, in fact, compulsory. The minimum insurance currently required is $ 15,000 liability coverage per person injured, $ 50,000 per accident, and $ 5,000  for property damage.  ( Veh. Code, Â§ 16056, subd.  (a) .) The individual plaintiffs in the present case all reside in South Central Los Angeles, and the evidentiary record on which they  base their motion for preliminary injunction refers to that area.  Statewide information on insurance rates, however, suggests that  the problem of obtaining insurance at affordable rates exists in portions of Oakland, and probably in other low-income urban  areas. For discussion of a similar problem involving property insurance, see Note,  Property Insurance and the American Ghetto: A  Study in Social Irresponsibility  (1971) 44 So. Cal. L. Rev.  218.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
303,"The declarations refer to insurance rates as of 1985; current rates are generally higher and the magnitude of the problem has,  if anything, become worse.  (See Dept. Ins. Auto Ins.  Premium Survey (July 15, 1987).) The survey gave the example of a  policy providing minimum coverage issued to a 45-year-old married couple with clean driving records.  Such a policy would cost  from $ 750 to $ 1,500 in South Central Los Angeles (an average of about $ 1,000).  It would cost from $ 250 to $ 400 in San  Diego, and from $ 150 to $ 300 in Redding. As of 1985, $ 481 was the lowest assigned risk rate available for this territory.  (Current rates are higher.) It applied to males  over 25, or females over 21, who do not use their car to drive to work, and have a completely clean driving record. It is possible  that some other plaintiffs could have obtained assigned risk policies for $ 481, far less than the private rates recited in their  declarations. Typically, assigned risk rates are much higher than private rates.  The converse situation in South Central Los Angeles arises  not because assigned risk rates are low for that region -- to the contrary, that territory has the highest assigned risk rates -- but  because the territorial differences in assigned risk rates are much less than the territorial differences in private rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
304,"Davis explained that residents can obtain insurance in only three ways, assigned risk, ""substandard companies,"" and  insurance by mail.  The substandard companies charge more than assigned risk rates.  Companies operating by mail ""provide  no service through agents or offices for acquiring insurance, servicing policies, or handling claims."" As summarized in  County of Los Angeles v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1982) 132 Cal. App. 3d 77, 87 [182 Cal. Rptr. 879] :  ""[The] Commissioner has the power to take corrective action as he deems necessary and proper ( Ins. Code, Â§ 1858.3 ); he can  impose a money penalty not to exceed $ 1,000 for each failure to comply up to a total penalty of and aggregating no more than $  30,000 ( Ins. Code, Â§ 1858.3 ); he can issue an order specifying in what respects a violation exists and require compliance within  a reasonable time thereafter ( Ins. Code, Â§ 1855.3, subds. (b)  and  (c) ); and in addition to the other penalties provided, he may  suspend or revoke, in whole or in part, the certificate of authority of an insurer with respect to the class or classes of insurance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
305,"specified in such order which fails to comply within the time limited by such lawful order of the Commissioner pursuant to  section  1858.3 .  ( Ins. Code, Â§ 1858.4 .)"" Plaintiffs challenge the insurers' claim that rates in South Central Los Angeles are actuarially sound, contending that so little  private insurance is now sold in that area that the insurers' accident and loss computations are not statistically reliable.  Indeed,  considering the disparity between private rates and assigned risk rates for that region, it is difficult to believe that both are  actuarially sound.  The question is one which would have to be tested by inquiry into the rates at a trial on the merits.  At this  stage of the litigation, however, plaintiffs have presented insufficient evidence for us to conclude that the insurers' rates lack  actuarial justification. The fact that current territorial rates may be actuarially justified does not mean that a rate which placed less weight on  residence would be unsound, or would be unfair to residents of low-risk territories.  As explained by the United States Supreme  Court, discussing a company requirement that women pay more into a retirement program because they live longer as a class,  ""when insurance risks are grouped, the better risks always subsidize the poorer risks.  Healthy persons subsidize medical  benefits for the less healthy; unmarried workers subsidize the pensions of married workers; persons who eat, drink, or smoke to  excess may subsidize pension profits for persons whose habits are more temperate.  Treating different classes of risks as  though they were the same for purposes of group insurance is a common practice that has never been considered inherently  unfair. To insure the flabby and the fit as though they were equivalent risks may be more common than treating men and women  alike; but nothing more than habit makes one 'subsidy' seem less fair than the other."" (  Los Angeles Dept. of Water & Power v.  Manhart (1978) 435 U.S. 702, 710 , fns. omitted [ 55 L. Ed. 2d 657, 666-667, 98 S. Ct. 1370] .) In  Shavers v. Kelley, supra, 267 N.W.2d 72 , the Michigan Supreme Court found state regulation of automobile insurance rates  constitutionally inadequate, in part because ""[the] statutory structure against 'excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory'  rates is without the support of clarifying rules established by the Commissioner, with legislatively sufficient definition, and without  any history of prior court interpretation."" (P. 88.) In 1978 the County of Los Angeles filed a complaint with the Insurance Commission, charging two insurers with 20 specified  unlawful practices relating to territorial classifications. The Commissioner conducted public hearings and reached the following  conclusions: "". . . .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
306,"""2. That the use of territorial classification does constitute a reasonable and credible rating criterion, but that this finding should  not be considered a blanket approval of the territorial classification presently used by the insurance industry.  '[Concerns]  expressed by many individuals who wrote to the Commissioners or testified at the hearings to express their sincere and honest  bewilderment about the fact that such costs appear to fall more heavily upon those least able to pay are clearly well deserving of  further consideration by the Department to identify these perceived inequities'; ""3. That the methodologies used to develop geographical rates reasonably achieve the goals intended and therefore are  actuarially valid."" (  County of Los Angeles v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, supra, 132 Cal. App. 3d 77, 84-85 , summarizing the  Commissioner's ""Findings and Recommendations"" filed Dec. 20, 1979.) The county then filed suit against the insurers and the Commissioner.  The trial court upheld demurrers, with leave to amend as  to the Commissioner but without leave to amend as to the insurers. On appeal from the latter ruling, the Court of Appeal held  that the county had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies because it had not insisted that the Commissioner render  findings on the specific unlawful practices alleged in the original complaint.  ( 132 Cal. App. 3d 77, 87 .) We have not been informed about any further developments in this suit.  And despite the reservations in the Commissioner's  1979 decision, the Commissioner has done little or nothing to curb pricing polices which ""fall more heavily on those least able to  pay.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
307,"Plaintiffs assert that a person insured under the program is often rejected or charged higher rates by private companies when  he seeks additional insurance (collision or comprehensive coverage, or liability coverage above the minimum).  He may also be  subject to discrimination when he later tries to leave the program and obtain private coverage. The Commissioner has taken  note of this discrimination, but true to the philosophy that nothing is unfair which is actuarially sound, he has ordered the insurers  only to desist from discrimination if they cannot show actuarial justification. In 1985 the insurers requested an increase in assigned risk rates of 60 percent.  The Commissioner granted only a 20 percent  increase.  His opinion, however, makes no mention of affordability, but rejects the insurers' proposal because it did not take  account of investment income. Amicus Consumers Union did appear at the hearing to set the rates which took effect in January of 1987.  It complains that  while it was permitted to put on its evidence, it was not permitted to participate as a party and to cross-examine the insurers'  witnesses.  Consumers Union further claims that the Commissioner's decision simply stated the alternatives and adopted one of  them, without considering Consumers Union's contentions -- a format which impedes judicial review.  The complaints sound very  much like those plaintiffs raise about Commissioner action under  section 1852 .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

314,"Opinion Several days after oral argument in this case, defendant Texaco petitioned under the federal bankruptcy law for protection from  creditors.  Thereafter the United States Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, approved by order a stipulation  between the parties in this suit.

316,"Although overlooked by some prominent commentators who have focused on the history of the federal antitrust laws, it has  been correctly observed that ""the first legislation spawned by the national antitrust movement of the late nineteenth century  occurred at the state level."" (Thorelli, The Federal Antitrust Policy: Origin of An American Tradition (1955) pp. 155-157; Rubin,  supra , 26 U. Fla. L.Rev at p. 657, and fn. 21.) Indeed, it appears from the debates of the Sherman Act, and the language of the  Clayton Act, that Congress borrowed liberally from state statutes of the day (in addition to the common law).  On the subject of  mergers, for example, compare the acts of Texas (1899), Mississippi (1900), Texas (1903), and Arkansas (1905), all discussed  post , pages 1159-1160, with the original language of the Clayton Act (38 Stats. 730 (1914)). (1890) Miss. Laws, ch. 36.) Still, the Texas law was well publicized in this early period.  The Texas bill was presented at  conventions of state legislators in 1889 and 1890, and ""this attention . . . resulted in several states copying [the Texas bill].""

In addition to the initial round of states that adopted the Kansas-Maine format ( ante , p. 1154), at least five more states adopted  that format. (1891 Ill. Laws, p. 206; 1897 S.C. Acts, No. 265; 1899 Ark. Acts 41; 1907 Wis. Laws, Â§ 1791j, pp. 432-433; 1907  Ind.Acts, ch. 243.) Moreover, a number of states, some of which had previously embraced the Texas format, subsequently  enacted a law using the Kansas-Maine format. (See the laws of Kansas, Texas, and Mississippi,  post , fn. 9.) It is widely recognized that the 1889 Texas act served as the model for a number of state acts that followed it.  (Rubin,  supra ,  26 U. Fla. L.Rev. 653, 659; Mathews, Texas Antitrust Laws, pp. 29-30.) In addition to the initial laws of Mississippi and Ohio (see  1890 Miss. Laws, ch. 36; 1898 Ohio Laws, p. 143), the Texas act appears to have been the model for the subsequent acts of  Kansas, Michigan, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, as well as forming the basis for later revisions of the Texas antitrust  acts.  (See  post , fn. 9.) Texas enacted a new act, similar in all relevant respects to its first, in 1895.  (1895 Tex. Gen. Laws, ch. 83.) Mississippi, in  1900, and Texas, in 1899, switched from the Texas format to the Kansas-Maine format. (1900 Miss. Laws, ch. 88; 1899 Tex.  Gen. Laws, ch. 146.) Missouri reenacted its Kansas-type act in 1891 (Mo. Laws, p. 186) and did so again in 1895 (Mo. Laws, p.  237).  Texas then switched, as did five other states, from the Kansas-Maine format to the Texas format. (1903 Tex. Gen. Laws,  ch. 94; 1897 Neb. Laws, ch. 79; 1897 Kan. Sess. Laws, ch. 265; 1897 S.D. Laws, ch. 94; 1899 Mich. Pub. Acts, No. 255; 1905  N.D. Laws, ch. 188.) In 1893, and again in 1897, Illinois reenacted Kansas-type laws (Ill. Laws, p. 89; Ill. Laws, p. 298).  In 1899  Kansas returned to its original format, and Missouri again reenacted a Kansas-type law (1899 Kan. Sess. Laws, ch. 293; 1899  Mo. Laws, p. 314).  In 1905, Nebraska switched to a format following the Sherman Act. (1905 Neb. Laws, ch. 162.) Tennessee  reenacted a law following the Kansas scheme (1903 Tenn. Pub. Acts, ch. 140), and Michigan returned to a Kansas-type law.   (1905 Mich. Pub. Acts, No. 229.) Arkansas reenacted a Kansas-type law (1905 Ark. Acts, No. 1).  Finally, Missouri continued to  tinker with its Kansas-type law.  (1907 Mo. Laws, p. 377.) At least one state enacted a law that combined attributes of the two  formats. (1892 La.

318,"The court first confronted the meaning of the term in   Texas & P. Coal Co. v. Lawson (1896) 89 Tex. 400 [34 S.W. 919] . In that  case, a coal company leased some of its land to a saloon owner.  The contract provided the company would lease to no other  saloon; that it would pay its employees by check, not money; and that the saloon would accept the checks as payment, and  remit to the company two-thirds of the profits as rent.  The court held this illegal under the statute because ""the contract  provided, not only for the union or association by the parties of their capital, but also for their united and associated action,  during the entire term, in furtherance of the common object, and was, therefore, a 'combination of capital' and 'acts.'""

320,"Comparison of selected relevant language (and enforcement provisions) from the various acts and the Reagan bills of 1889  and 1890 demonstrates that the Cartwright Act, although similar in many respects to the Reagan bill of 1890, is more similar to  the Texas and Michigan acts.  Comparison also discloses that the language of the Cartwright Act has very little in common with  that of the Sherman Act. By way of example, some key passages are set out below, with deviation from the words and  punctuation of the Cartwright Act noted by underscoring. The Cartwright Act.  As originally enacted, the Cartwright Act read: ""A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or  more persons, firms, partnerships, corporations or associations of persons, or of any two or more of them for either, any or all of  the following purposes: [para. ] 1. To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce. . . .  [para. ] 5. To make or enter into  or execute or carry out any contracts, obligations or agreements of any kind or description, . . . so as to directly or indirectly  preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves, . . . or by which they shall agree to pool, combine or directly or  indirectly unite any interests that they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any such article or commodity, that  its price might in any manner be affected.  . . ."" (Stats. 1907, ch. 530,  Â§ 1 (1)  &  (5) , pp. 984-985.) The Reagan Bill of 1888.  This bill read: ""That a trust is the combination of capital    or skill . . . by two or more persons    . . . for .  . . the following purposes: [para. ] First. To create or carry out restrictions on trade . . . .  [para. ] Fourth.  To create a monopoly. .  . ."" (19 Cong.Rec. p. 7512.) The Texas act of 1889.  The original Texas act expanded the scope and specified the reach of the 1888 Reagan bill by rewriting  the first sentence, and adding a fifth paragraph.  It also narrowed the reach of the act by deleting the monopoly provision.  It read  as follows: ""That a trust is a combination of capital, skill, or acts by two or more persons, firms, . . . corporations, or associations  of persons, or of either two or more of them for either, any, or all of the following purposes: First -- To create or carry out  restrictions in trade . . . .

(1889 Tex. Gen. Laws, ch. 117,  Â§ 1 .) The acts of  Mississippi and North Dakota closely follow this language.  (1890 Miss. Laws, ch. 36,  Â§ 1 ; 1905 N.D. Laws, ch. 188,  Â§ 1 .) The Reagan bill of 1890.  This second Reagan bill copied the first sentence of the above act, replaced the monopoly provision,  renumbered the final sentence as paragraph six, copied the first half of that sentence from the above act, and made syntax and  punctuation changes in the last half of that sentence.  It read as follows: ""That a trust is a combination of capital, skill, or acts by  two or more persons, firms, . . . corporations, or associations of persons, or of any two or more of them for either, any, or all of  the following purposes: [para. ] First.

(21 Cong.Rec. p. 2456 (1890).) The Michigan act of 1899.  This act modified the first sentence by adding the word ""partnerships,"" substituting ""arts"" for ""acts,""  and deleting some punctuation.  It also deleted the monopoly provision, added an opening clause to the fifth paragraph, made  plural that paragraph's list of ""contracts, obligations or agreements,"" added the phrase ""directly or indirectly"" in two places in the  middle of that sentence, and modified (consistently with the 1889 Texas act) the syntax of the final clause of the last sentence  (""that its price might in any manner be affected.  . . ."").

(1899 Mich. Pub. Acts, No. 255,  Â§ 1 (1)  &  (5) .)  Michigan, in turn, appears to have followed the language of the Ohio act of 1898.  (See Ohio Laws, p. 143 et seq.,  Â§ 1 (1)  &  (5) .) (The language of the Sherman Act, by contrast, differed substantially from all of the above.  See  ante , pp. 1155-1156, quoting  15  U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1 ,  2 .) In addition to the above noted differences in language and coverage between the Reagan bills and the Cartwright Act, we also  note that the two Reagan bills differed in another significant respect from the Cartwright Act, and from the acts of Texas and  Michigan: Unlike the latter acts, the Reagan bills contained essentially no enforcement provision.  (Compare 19 Cong.Rec.  7512-7513 (1888), and 21 Cong.Rec. 2456 (1890), with 1889 Tex. Gen. Laws, ch. 117, Â§Â§ 2-5, 7-9; 1899 Mich. Pub. Acts, No.  255, Â§Â§ 2-3, 5-6, 11; and Stats. 1907, ch. 530, Â§Â§ 2-3, 5-6, 11.) This, together with the striking similarity between the  enforcement provisions of the three acts, further indicates that the Cartwright Act was modeled after the Texas and Michigan  acts, and not the Reagan bills or the Sherman Act. Additionally, it is clear that our Legislature is well aware of the Clayton Act, section 7 of which expressly regulates mergers.  ( 15 U.S.C. Â§ 18 ; see  post , fn. 18.) In 1961 the Legislature enacted  Business and Professions Code section 16727 , essentially  adopting  section 3  of the Clayton Act ( 15 U.S.C.

337,"The pertinent discussion in  Gates  is as follows: ""In order to constitute a trust, within the meaning of the statute, there must be a  'combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more.' 'Combination,' as here used, means union or association.  If there be no  union or association by two or more of their 'capital, skill or acts,' there can be no 'combination,' and hence no 'trust.' When we  consider the purposes for which the 'combination' must be formed, to come within the statute, the essential meaning of the word  'combination,' and the fact that a punishment is prescribed for each day that the trust continues in existence, we are led to the  conclusion that the union or association of 'capital, skill or acts' denounced is where the parties in the particular case designed  the united co-operation of such agencies, which might have been otherwise independent and competing, for the accomplishment  of one or more of such purposes.  In the case stated in the petition there is no 'combination.' The plaintiff bought defendant's  goods, together with the good will of his business, both of which were subjects of purchase and sale; and, in order to render the  sale of the good will effectual, the seller agreed that he would not, for one year thereafter, do a like business in that town.  This  was but a kind of covenant or warranty that the purchaser should have the use and benefit of such good will during that year; for  it is clear that, if the seller had immediately engaged in a like business at the same place, the purchaser would have had no  benefit therefrom.  By this transaction neither the capital, skill, nor acts of the parties were brought into any kind of union,  association, or co-operative action.  The purchaser became the owner of the things sold, and the seller was, by the terms of the  contract, restrained from doing a thing which, if done, would have defeated in part the effectiveness of the sale.  The agreement  that the seller would exert himself to aid the purchaser in securing patronage but constituted the former the agent of the latter for  that purpose, and in no wise contravened the statute.""

338,"The majority present three minor arguments in support of their conclusion that the Cartwright Act cannot be construed to cover  mergers. The first is that at the time the statute was enacted the term ""combination"" referred narrowly to only that kind of  arrangement in which the combining entities maintain separate and independent interests and identities.  As I have shown, this  is not so.  The majority may be understood to claim that certain language in   G.H.I.I. v. MTS, Inc. (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 256,  266 [195 Cal.Rptr. 211, 41 A.L.R.4th 653] , and   Bondi v. Jewels by Edwar, Ltd. (1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 672, 678 [73 Cal.Rptr.  494] , support their construction.  They are wrong: that language says nothing more than that ""combination"" does embrace an  arrangement between two or more persons  within a single entity . The majority's second argument is that had the Legislature intended the Cartwright Act to apply to mergers it would have  inserted an express antimerger provision as other state legislatures had done.  But if as I have concluded the language of the  act is broad enough to reach mergers, no such express provision was needed.  If the Legislature has never expressly provided  that the Cartwright Act is applicable to mergers, it is because it has never had to.  As I have explained, in   Munter v. Eastman  Kodak Co., supra, 28 Cal.App. 660 , the Court of Appeal stated clearly, albeit impliedly, that although only mergers with  anticompetitive effects are unlawful under the Cartwright Act, mergers are indeed within the act's coverage. The majority's third argument appears to be as follows: in 1961 the Legislature enacted  Business and Professions Code section  16727  (hereinafter  section 16727 ), which essentially incorporated  section 3  of the Clayton Act ( 15 U.S.C. Â§ 14 ) prohibiting  exclusive-dealing agreements; in so doing it manifested its recognition that the Cartwright Act did not have the reach of the  Clayton Act generally; it thereby impliedly recognized that the Cartwright Act did not cover mergers. The argument is  unpersuasive.  I believe that the Legislature's enactment of  section 16727  can reasonably be understood not as the recognition  the majority claim it is, but rather as a response to the decision in   Rolley, Inc. v. Merle Norman Cosmetics, supra, 129  Cal.App.2d 844, 845-852 , which held that the Cartwright Act did not apply to exclusive-dealing agreements. In an attempt to support their conclusion that the Legislature did not intend to include mergers in the scope of the Cartwright Act,  the majority assert that that body may have had a reason to so limit the statute's reach.  On this point, however, they engage in  mere speculation and conjecture -- and altogether unpersuasive speculation and conjecture at that: in view of the fact that it  sought to further consumer welfare by enacting the Cartwright Act, the Legislature cannot reasonably be deemed to have  intended the application of the statute to turn on the formal characteristics of an arrangement rather than on its potential  economic effects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
339,"In   Rolley, Inc. v. Merle Norman Cosmetics, supra, 129 Cal.App.2d 844 , the court stated: ""the Clayton Act is broader in its  prohibitions than the Sherman Act.

(1957) 152 Cal.App.2d 418 [313 P.2d 936] , the court followed  Rolley : ""the Clayton Act is broader in its  prohibitions than the Sherman Act, and, in the same respects, is broader than the Cartwright Act . . . .""

340,"I observe in passing that as of this date the FTC's ""solution"" to the anticompetitive problems posed by the Texaco-Getty merger  in California appears destined for failure.  As noted above, that ""solution"" was predicated on the expectation that by 1989, when  the part of the consent order requiring Texaco to supply Getty crude oil to independent refiners in the state expires, there would  be new supplies of oil from offshore sites to satisfy all market demands.  That expectation, however, will likely be frustrated.  It  currently appears that offshore sites may not even be leased for oil production until 1990 or later. Defendants have submitted briefs in which they present arguments to the contrary.  In the course of my analysis I shall address  their points.  After briefing was completed, they directed the court's attention to an article by Daniel Oliver, appointed to the FTC  as Chairman in 1986, which is essentially devoted to an analysis of the present action:  Federal and State Antitrust Enforcement:  Constitutional Principles and Policy Considerations   (1988) 9 Cardozo L.Rev. 1245 [hereinafter Oliver,  Federal and State  Antitrust Enforcement ].

The legislative history cited by defendants and rehearsed  in Oliver,  Federal and State Antitrust Enforcement, supra , 9 Cardozo L.Rev. at page 1270, establishes only that the savings  provision was intended, inter alia, to preserve the federal government's right to challenge a merger -- not that it was meant to  preclude a challenge founded in state law.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chief assistant expressed concern that notwithstanding other sections of the UIPA, it could be construed to  preclude use of the sanctions available under existing law. That concern led to the inclusion of  section 790.09  in the proposed  legislation. The Insurance Commissioner, whose office proposed inclusion of  section 790.09  in the UIPA to ensure that existing remedies  would be preserved, continues to take the position that the Legislature did not intend, by adoption of the UIPA, to supersede the  Cartwright Act or any other state laws. Appearing as amicus curiae in support of plaintiff, the commissioner expresses his belief  that regulatory enforcement by his office is complementary to the Cartwright Act and the UCA. Both the commissioner and the  California District Attorneys Association, which also appears as amicus curiae, express the belief that the public interest is  served by vigorous enforcement of all three statutes. The California District Attorneys Association asserts that actions under the  UCA have become the principal law enforcement instrument of prosecutors in the areas of consumer protection and unfair  competition, with more than 200 such actions being prosecuted annually. The UCA is also the basis for prosecutions brought to  supplement provisions of the Health and Safety Code and the Labor Code to remedy public health and sanitation and public  safety violations, and its use to supplement other provisions of law has been upheld repeatedly.

(Dis. opn.,  post , at p. 1272.) In our view, the text of  section 17045  is not so much ambiguous as simply silent on the question before us; it neither restricts ""competition"" to the  primary line, nor expressly extends to competition in the secondary line. The dissent, like MECA, relies heavily on a supposed  implication arising from  section 17045 's reference to the prohibited acts of sellers, but, as we have seen, any such implication  dissolves when the statutory context--especially  sections 17046 ,  17047  and  17048 --is considered.

[P] The Goliath is the huge  chain stores sapping the civic life of local communities with an absentee overlordship, draining off their earnings to his coffers,  and reducing their independent business men to employees or to idleness. [P] His weapon is huge buying power, by the  manipulation of which he threatens manufacturers and others with financial stringency or even bankruptcy if they refuse him the  prices and terms he demands. His opponents are not only these manufacturers, not only the independent competitors whom he  seeks to eliminate, but the consuming public, whom he hopes then to have at his mercy."" (Remarks of Rep.

Elsewhere Representative  Patman emphasized that the chains were enriching themselves at the expense of independent merchants not through fair and  open competition but through ""secret rebates"" and ""special discounts"" not available to the independents.

Plotkin  did not involve unearned discounts or any form of  discriminatory pricing, and discussed only  sections 17040  and  17043 . The discussion in  Carlock  concerned only  section 17040 .  Similarly, the dissenting opinion's reliance on  Beam v. Monsanto Co., Inc. (1976) 259 Ark. 253 [532 S.W.2d 175, 181-182]  (dis.  opn.,  post , at p. 1279, fn. 2) is misplaced, as that decision concerned only a locality discrimination prohibition modeled on  sections 17031  and  17040 . For the proposition that the UPA operates ""horizontally"" rather than ""vertically,"" we cited, in  Harris , three law review articles, two  of which MECA cites for the same proposition. None specifically addresses the question before us. The principal authority relied  upon, Professor Ewald Grether, appears to have meant, in distinguishing between the ""horizontal"" UPA and the ""vertical"" Fair  Trade Law, merely that under the UPA ""action . . . need not wait upon the initiative of manufacturers or distributors at the apex of  the distributive pyramid, but may arise at any level."" (Grether,  supra , 24 Cal.L.Rev. at p. 686.) One should also note that  Professor Grether, in the cited article, focused on the historical background and prospects for enforcement of the UPA and Fair  Trade Law, and disavowed any intent to engage in ""[i]nterpretation of the law, technically speaking."" (  Id. at p. 641 .) The  reference to ""the horizontal concept of trade regulation"" in Cupp,  The Unfair Practices Act  (1936) 10 So.Cal.L.Rev. 18, is brief  and nonspecific. The final academic passage quoted in  Harris, supra, 64 Cal. 2d at pages 461-462 , deals specifically with  primary versus secondary line injury, but was concerned only with the locality discrimination provisions, which, of course, were  also the only provisions at issue in this part of  Harris . (Bermingham,  Legal Aspects of Petroleum Marketing Under Federal and  California Laws  (1960)  7 UCLA L.Rev. 161, 246-247 .)

In its second cause of action, ABC alleged MECA's violation of  section 17045  constituted  unfair competition within this definition. HN10 [ ]  MECA also cites and provides the court with selected staff analyses, reports and letters accompanying the 1976 amendment  of  section 17203  by which the explicit authorization for restitutionary relief was added. None of them discuss the question before  us, although the language of some reveals the authors'  assumptions  that restitution would be ancillary to an injunction. Whatever  value these materials might have provided in resolving the present question evaporates upon examination of other reports,  analyses and letters cited and provided by an amicus curiae supporting ABC's position--materials that, in some cases, reflect the  opposite assumption as to the independence of restitution from injunctive relief, and in other cases neutrally describe the  proposed amendments without making any such assumption. Neither set of legislative materials indicates the Legislature  actually considered and resolved the question before us. (See  California Teachers Assn. v.

This account of the scope of unfair practice provisions of other states differs, it is apparent, from the majority's evaluation. (Maj.  opn.,  ante , at p. 1261, fn. 6.) The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals' gloss on the Arkansas act, cited by the majority, merely  declares, without analysis or discussion, that it was passed in 1937 shortly after the Robinson-Patman Act, ""and was obviously  designed to prohibit similar types of business conduct.""

I am persuaded by the contrary reasoning and result of the Arkansas cases cited above interpreting that  state's statute as ""horizontal."" The opinion of the Wyoming Supreme Court in  State v. Langley (1938) 53 Wyo. 332 [84 P.2d  767] , also cited by the majority, involved a criminal prosecution under a statute prohibiting sales below cost; although a provision  of the statute contains language similar to  section 17001 , the opinion is too obscure to stand for much, other than the statement  that the provision prohibiting such sales ""was probably intended mainly for"" the independent merchant.  ( 84 P.2d at p. 774 .) The  price discrimination provision of the Wisconsin act, also cited by the majority, is almost identical to  section 17045 , and at least  one Wisconsin appellate court has construed it as applying vertically.

Neither PG&E's  petition for review nor the briefs of the parties in this court mention the matter. Accordingly, we do not consider the propriety of  the County's cause of action for unfair competition. On January 16, 1996, shortly after we granted review of this matter, the federal district court dismissed the County's class  action for reasons unrelated to the issues in this case. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld  the dismissal. (  County of Stanislaus v. Pacific Gas and Elec. Co. (9th Cir. 1997) 114 F.3d 858 .) Neither party has argued that  the dismissal has rendered this case moot. Although PG&E's cause of action seeking injunctive relief appears moot, a live  controversy may remain regarding its request for declaratory relief. (See  Van Atta v. Scott (1980) 27 Cal. 3d 424, 449-450 [166  Cal. Rptr. 149, 613 P.2d 210] ;  Stanson v. Mott (1976) 17 Cal. 3d 206, 223 [130 Cal. Rptr. 697, 551 P.2d 1] .)

437,"Apparently taking her cue from the brief of amicus curiae American Council of Life Insurance, Justice Kennard asserts the  unfair competition law did nothing more than codify the common law. (Conc. & dis. opn. of Kennard, J.,  post , at p. 194.) (Even  L.A. Cellular does not make such a sweeping argument.) She relies primarily on  International etc. Workers v.

Regarding the language Justice Kennard cites, we  stated, ""Although the  Landowitz  opinion does contain some language which may be read to limit [Civil Code former] section  3369 [the original unfair competition law] to common law 'unfair competition,' subsequent cases . . . have not confined the  section so narrowly; in view of the factual context of  Landowitz , such language was not crucial to the decision.""

We held in  each that the plaintiff's allegations--entirely different from the allegations here--did not state a cause of action under the unfair  competition law or some other law.

440,"Section 5 contains two prohibitions: one against ""unfair methods of competition"" and the other against ""unfair or deceptive acts  or practices."" The former generally governs injuries to competitors, the latter injuries to consumers as well as competitors. (  Barquis v. Merchants Collection Assn., supra, 7 Cal. 3d at pp. 109-110 .) Our notice of federal law under section 5 means only  that federal cases interpreting the prohibition against ""unfair methods of competition"" may assist us in determining whether a  particular challenged act or practice is unfair under the test we adopt. We do not deem the federal cases controlling or  determinative, merely persuasive. This case involves an action by a competitor alleging anticompetitive practices. Our discussion and this test are limited to that  context. Nothing we say relates to actions by consumers or by competitors alleging other kinds of violations of the unfair  competition law such as ""fraudulent"" or ""unlawful"" business practices or ""unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising."" We  also express no view on the application of federal cases such as  FTC v. Sperry & Hutchinson Co. (1972) 405 U.S. 233 [92 S. Ct.  898, 31 L. Ed. 2d 170]  that involve injury to consumers and therefore do not relate to actions like this one.   Contrary to Justice Kennard's concurring and dissenting opinion, this test is not unduly uncertain. A body of law interpreting  section 5 already exists. (See, e.g., Averitt,  The Meaning of ""Unfair Methods of Competition"" in Section 5 of the Federal Trade  Commission Act  (1980) 21 B.C. L.Rev. 227.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

444,"In the prestatutory period, the one use of the term ""unfair competition"" in the common law that developed outside the area of  consumer deception was trade secret misappropriation. (  Scavengers' P. Assn. v. Serv-U-Garbage Co. (1933) 218 Cal. 568 [24  P.2d 489] ;  Pasadena Ice Co. v. Reeder (1929) 206 Cal. 697, 703 [275 P. 944, 276 P. 995] ;  New Method Laundry Co. v.  MacCann (1916) 174 Cal. 26, 30 [161 P. 990] .) Economically, however, there is a strong similarity between the deceptive  misappropriation of a trade name and the form of trade secret misappropriation most common in this court's cases of that period,  namely, use of a competitor's customer lists. This becomes apparent when one considers that for a transaction to occur it is not  enough for a business to offer a desirable product at a competitive price. Every business also faces the problem, and expense,  of searching out customers to inform them of its product and to persuade them to purchase it. In a trade name misappropriation  case, the plaintiff has done so by incurring the cost of establishing a valuable trade name that serves as an efficient vehicle for  disseminating information about its product to its customers. In a customer list misappropriation case, the plaintiff has done so  by identifying individual customers and their needs, incurring the cost of acquiring that information. In both trade name and  customer list misappropriation cases, the defendant is able to reduce its search costs incurred in obtaining new customers by  free-riding on the investments of the plaintiff in searching out customers. It may have been an intuitive recognition of this  similarity that led courts of the prestatutory period to extend the rubric of unfair competition to trade secret misappropriation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
446,"In looking to section 5 of the FTC Act, the majority may have been misled by this court's previous statement that the unfair  competition law had ""its origin as one of the so-called 'little FTC Acts' of the 1930's, enacted by many states in the wake of  amendments to the Federal Trade Commission Act [i.e., the Wheeler-Lea Act of 1938, 52 Statutes at Large 111, which added  the phrase 'unfair or deceptive acts or practices' to the 'unfair methods of competition' prohibited by section 5 of the FTC Act]  enlarging the commission's regulatory jurisdiction to include unfair business practices that harmed, not merely the interests of  business competitors, but of the general public as well."" (  Rubin v. Green (1993) 4 Cal. 4th 1187, 1200 [17 Cal. Rptr. 2d 828,  847 P.2d 1044] .)  Contrary to the assertion in  Rubin v. Green, supra, 4 Cal. 4th 1187, 1200 , there were no "" 'little FTC Acts' of the 1930's."" The  term ""little FTC Act"" instead denotes a group of state statutes enacted in the 1960's and 1970's; these statutes, promoted by the  FTC among others, were meant to complement the deceptive practices jurisdiction of the FTC, not its antitrust jurisdiction, and  they address deceptive trade practices, not antitrust threats to competition. (See, e.g., Karns,  State Regulation of Deceptive  Trade Practices Under ""Little FTC Acts"": Should Federal Standards Control?  (1990) 94 Dick. L.Rev. 373, 373-376; Bailey &  Pertschuk,  The Law of Deception: The Past as Prologue  (1984)  33 Am. U.

California has such a ""little FTC Act"" incorporating verbatim the language of section 5 of the FTC Act, but it is not  Business and  Professions Code section 17200 et seq. , the unfair competition law, and it does not prohibit penumbral antitrust threats. Rather,  it is  Civil Code sections 1750- 1784 , the Consumers Legal Remedies Act, which was enacted in 1970. The act lists certain  prohibited ""unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices"" (the language of section 5 of the FTC Act),  beginning with ""passing off,"" and it provides various remedies to injured consumers. (  Civ. Code, Â§ 1770 ; see also Reed,  Legislating for the Consumer: An Insider's Analysis of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act  (1971) 2 Pacific L.J. 1.)  In addition to misunderstanding the term ""little FTC Act,""  Rubin v. Green, supra, 4 Cal. 4th 1187, 1200 , mixes up its chronology;  because  section 3369  was enacted in 1933, five years before the 1938 amendment expanding the FTC's jurisdiction, it obviously  was not enacted in the ""wake"" of that amendment. The sole authority  Rubin  cites on this point,  Bank of the West v. Superior  Court, supra, 2 Cal. 4th 1254, 1264 , is equally confused: ""A host of so-called 'little FTC Acts' followed [the 1938 amendment of  the FTC Act] including California's Unfair Business Practices Act. ( Â§ 17200 et seq. ; see also Civ. Code, former  Â§ 3369 .)"" It is  worth noting that in each of these cases the question of the historical origins of the unfair competition law was not at issue and  was not dispositive of any issue. Each decision discussed the point only in passing by way of background. The majority also misunderstands the significance of  Barquis's  statement that "" section 3369  indicates that 'unfair competition'  as used in the section cannot be equated with the common law definition of 'unfair competition,' but instead specifies that, for the  purposes of its provisions, unfair competition 'shall mean and include  unlawful ,  unfair  or fraudulent business practice . . . .' "" (  Barquis v. Merchants Collection Assn., supra, 7 Cal. 3d at p. 109 , italics original; see maj. opn.,  ante , at p. 181, fn. 9.) Our point  was that the unfair competition law expanded beyond the limits of common law unfair competition along two dimensions: First,  because the unfair competition law provided relief for injury to consumers even absent any showing of injury to a competitor, it  ""extended to the entire consuming public the protection once afforded only to business competitors."" (  Barquis v. Merchants  Collection Assn., supra, 7 Cal. 3d at p. 109 ; see also  id. at p. 110  [""the courts, in interpreting the section, have long declared that  the provision is at least as equally directed toward 'the right of the  public  to protection from fraud and deceit[,]' as toward the  preservation of fair business competition"" (italics original)].) Second, because the unfair competition law included  unlawful  as  well as  unfair  business practices, it prohibited a broader range of conduct than did common law unfair competition. (  Id. at pp.  112-113 .) Specifically, the unfair competition law prohibited not only the deceptive conduct that was an ""unfair . . . business  practice"" but also, as an ""unlawful . . . business practice,"" "" 'anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at  the same time is forbidden by law.' "" (  Id. at p. 113 .) Nothing in  Barquis  suggested, however, that the term ""unfair . . . business  practice"" meant penumbral antitrust threats, or that it did not mean deceptive conduct.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"" 'Cost' as applied to warranty service agreements includes the cost of parts, transporting the parts, labor, and all overhead  expenses of the service agency.

There, under pre-1985 procedures, a single appeal in  consolidated cases was before this court on grant of hearing. The discussion of the  section 17071  presumption there was in the  portion of the vacated Court of Appeal opinion which addressed a UPA cause of action. This court adopted that part of the  opinion because neither of the parties raised any issue as to its adequacy in the petition for hearing.  ( 63 Cal. 2d at p. 203 .) The  first issue addressed was whether the defendant corporation had sold its product below cost. The trial court found and the Court  of Appeal agreed that the evidence supported its finding that under applicable accounting practices the product was not sold  below cost. Moreover, the corporation did not intend to sell below cost. In that context the opinion states: ""That evidence was  sufficient to render the presumption embodied in  section 17071 of the Business and Professions Code  of little evidentiary value.  Consequently, it does not appear to be probable that a result more favorable to the plaintiff Tri-Q, Inc., would have been reached  by the trial court even if it had found that such prices were less than the actual cost of the product.""

499,"In successfully moving the superior court for a new trial following its order granting the petroleum companies summary  judgment, Aguilar, in effect, sought and obtained reconsideration of the order granting summary judgment. It is not hard to infer  why she did not move for reconsideration  eo nomine . First, to make a motion for reconsideration, she would have had to have  ""new or different facts, circumstances, or law"" in support. (  Code Civ. Proc., Â§ 1008, subd. (a) .) She apparently had none.  Second, by the date on which she made her motion for a new trial, the superior court had caused entry of judgment. After entry  of judgment, the superior court did not have jurisdiction to entertain or decide a motion for reconsideration. (See, e.g.,  In re  Marriage of Condon (1998) 62 Cal. App. 4th 533, 541, fn. 8 [73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 33] ;  Betz v. Pankow (1993) 16 Cal. App. 4th 931,  937-938 [20 Cal. Rptr. 2d 841] .)

That is not the case. See,  ante , at page 842, footnote 2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
502,"Exchange agreements have also be recognized as ""pro-environmental"" and safety enhancing, as by the Court of Appeal, to  the extent that they obviate or reduce the ecological and other risks attendant on the storage and transportation of petroleum  products. See, e.g.,  Serfecz v. Jewel Food Stores (7th Cir. 1995) 67 F.3d 591, 600-601  (holding that, ""by itself,"" evidence of motive to  enter into an unlawful conspiracy ""does not tend to exclude the possibility of independent, legitimate action and supplies no  basis for inferring [such] a conspiracy"");  Alvord-Polk, Inc. v. F. Schumacher & Co. (3d Cir. 1994) 37 F.3d 996, 1013  (holding to  similar effect expressly as to evidence of opportunity and impliedly as to evidence of means). In the course of its opinion, the Court of Appeal characterized the superior court's determination that it made an error in law in  its reading and application of  Biljac  as ""in fact"" a ""reflect[ion]"" of ""its belief that its initial decision regarding the evidentiary  strength of"" the declarations by officers and managers and similar employees presented by the petroleum companies ""was  incorrect."" We agree with the Court of Appeal about the superior court's belief.

503,"Although it did not criticize the superior court on this score, the Court of Appeal all but expressly concluded that evidence that  conclusively negated an unlawful conspiracy was of course sufficient, but not necessary, to carry an initial burden of production  to make a prima facie showing of the absence of any conspiracy. In alleging facts for her Cartwright Act cause of action, Aguilar proceeded on a theory, which was legally sound (see  Corwin v.  Los Angeles Newspaper Service Bureau, Inc., supra, 22 Cal. 3d at p. 314 ), that the assertedly unlawful conspiracy consisted of  an agreement among the petroleum companies as competitors to restrict the output of CARB gasoline and to raise its price, and  was unlawful per se without regard to any of its effects. In granting the petroleum companies summary judgment, the superior  court did so on that theory. On appeal, Aguilar apparently attempted to introduce an alternative theory, which was also legally  sound (see  ibid .), that the assertedly unlawful conspiracy consisted of the various exchange agreements entered into by the  various petroleum companies, and was unlawful because of its effects. The Court of Appeal rejected any such attempt as too  late. To the extent that Aguilar makes the same attempt on review, we reject it for the same reason. (See  Redwood Hatchery v.  Meadowbrook Farms (1957) 152 Cal. App. 2d 481, 486 [313 P.2d 146]  [stating that ""it is the duty of litigants to diligently prepare  cases for trial and ordinarily they will not be allowed to gamble on the result of a trial by presenting one theory and then if  judgment go against them get a new trial in order to try again for a favorable result under a different theory""].)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rptr. 2d 420, 900 P.2d 669] , rather than on  Quelimane, supra, 19 Cal.4th 26 . Both cases  discuss the intent requirement for the tort of interference with contract. Yet the  Quelimane  court did not consider the earlier per  curiam decision in  Seaman's . As we noted in  Della Penna , the  Seaman's  court ""rel[ied] on the  first  Restatement . . . without  reviewing or even mentioning intervening revaluations of the tort by the Restatement Second, other state high courts and our  own Court of Appeal."" (  Della Penna, supra, 11 Cal.4th at p. 389 .) Further, we expressly disapproved of our language in  Seaman's  to the extent that it was inconsistent with  Della Penna . ( Della Penna, at p. 393, fn. 5 .) Thus, we find in  Quelimane ,  which relies on  Della Penna  and the Restatement Second of Torts, a better representation than  Seaman's  of the current state of  the law .

We consider only whether, to state a claim for this tort, a plaintiff need allege that the defendant acted with a specific intent to  interfere with the plaintiff's business expectancy. A defendant's intent, as defined in  section 8A of the Restatement Second of  Torts , is still a triable issue of fact.

But it is apparent that each of the statements it quotes in support of this contention, when read in  context, are merely made in furtherance of  Buckaloo 's central thesis: that the existence of a contract is not  necessary  to maintain  an action for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. We need not in this case further define which sources of law can be relied on to determine whether a defendant has engaged  in an independently wrongful act, other than to say that such an act must be wrongful by some legal measure, rather than merely  a product of an improper, but lawful, purpose or motive. To the extent that the lower courts have determined otherwise, these  decisions are disapproved. (See, e.g.,  PMC, Inc. v. Saban Entertainment, Inc. (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 579, 603 [52 Cal.

548,"Contrary to the assertion of the concurring and dissenting opinion,  section 767  ""applies to each form of the tort,"" and is  therefore applicable to both interference with contract and interference with prospective economic advantage. (  Rest.2d Torts, Â§  767, com. a , p. 27.) Further, we find federal cases discussing antitrust and RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) law to be  inapplicable to the question of whether a plaintiff may state a claim under the California common law tort of interference with  prospective economic advantage. The federal antitrust cases cited by the concurring and dissenting opinion address the  question of whether the plaintiffs in those cases could maintain standing under section 4 of the Clayton Act ( 15 U.S.C. Â§ 15 ). (  Associated General Contractors v. California State Council of Carpenters (1983) 459 U.S. 519, 529 [74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 103 S. Ct.  897] .) To answer this question, these courts engage, inter alia, in an analysis of the statutory language of the Clayton Act, as  well as its relevant legislative history and objectives.  ( 459 U.S. at pp. 529-531, 538-540 .) The question of whether a plaintiff has  standing to bring a claim under a California common law tort is not subject to the same considerations and limitations that were  raised in the Clayton Act and RICO cases. Adopting this federal case law would be a significant departure from our prior cases  discussing this tort, especially  Buckaloo, supra, 14 Cal.3d 815 , and  Della Penna, supra, 11 Cal.4th 376 . Nevertheless, the  concurring and dissenting opinion points to the Restatement, which states in  section 768, comment f , that ""there is therefore  interplay between [ antitrust] law  and the law of tortious interference with prospective contractual relations."" The concurring and  dissenting opinion fails to include the remainder of this sentence, which continues: ""[ antitrust] law  is so involved and is so  primarily concerned with areas of public law  only   tangentially related  to tort law that it must be regarded as  outside the scope  of  the Restatement of Torts."" (  Rest.2d Torts, Â§ 768, com. c , p. 43, italics added.) We address only plaintiff's allegations as pleaded in its complaint. We express no view as to whether plaintiff's proof will be  sufficient to establish these elements at trial.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Maj. opn.,  ante , at p. 1163, fn. 12.) What I do assert is that given  the Restatement Second's caution that ""the weight carried by"" the various factors ""may vary considerably"" with respect to the  different interference torts ( Rest.2d, Â§ 767, com. a , p. 27), the majority errs in simply assuming that comment h's discussion of  remoteness in the context of interference with contract necessarily applies to the same extent to intentional interference with  prospective economic advantage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

562,"For similar reasons, the court also held that the distributors' antitrust claim failed as a matter of law. The court explained that  the distributors' injury was ""derivative of"" the bottling company's injury, and that ""a party in a business relationship with an entity  that failed as a result of an antitrust violation"" does ""not have standing to bring an antitrust claim."" (  G.K.A. Beverage Corp. v.  Honickman, supra, 55 F.3d at pp. 766-767 .) This rule, the court explained, ""follows naturally"" from the rule that "" '[m]erely",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
563,"derivative injuries sustained by employees, officers, stockholders, and creditors of an injured company do not . . . confer antitrust  standing.' [Citation.]"" (  Id. at p. 766 .) Apparently, under New York law, instead of showing wrongful means, a plaintiff may alternatively show that the defendant  ""acted for the sole purpose of inflicting intentional harm on plaintiffs."" (  NBT Bancorp Inc. v. Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc.  (1995) 215 A.D.2d 990 [628 N.Y.S.2d 408, 410] .) This fact does not undermine my conclusion that we should follow New York  law regarding remoteness. On the contrary, it reinforces my conclusion, because a defendant who acts solely to harm the  plaintiff is at least as blameworthy as a defendant who uses wrongful means and is only substantially certain that the plaintiff will  be harmed. Notably, in the Court of Appeal, even KSC agreed that federal cases addressing ""standing under the antitrust laws provide  useful guidance . . . in determining the reach of the tort of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.""  Similarly, the law review article on which the majority relies (maj. opn.,  ante , at p. 1163) states that ""[i]n a business competition  setting, antitrust laws . . . may serve as a yardstick for liability,"" and it argues for ""[i]ncorporating the fluid doctrines of antitrust",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Â§ 9.133 (2003) ; all further  citations to the Code of Federal Regulations are to the 2003 edition unless otherwise indicated.)   The labels set forth in Bronco's appendix to the petition for writ of mandate are divided into sections for each of the three brand  names. The labels selected for description below and displayed in the appendix to our opinion are the first from each section.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
580,"The word ?œvinted??is used when wine is fermented at one address and thereafter subjected to ?œcellar treatment??(such as  filtering) at a different address stated on the label. (See 27 C.F.R. Â§ 4.35a(a)(3)(iii) & (v).) Each back label also contains a further  statement concerning the appellation of origin. The Napa Ridge back label states: ?œThis White Merlot, from the Lodi Region of  Northern California, starts with an enticing aroma of strawberry and cherry ??.??The Napa Creek Winery back label states: ?œFrom  vineyards blessed by the warm days and cool nights of California's famed Lodi viticultural area, our Chardonnay is well  structured with complex flavors from partial barrel fermentation. ?¦â€?The Rutherford Vintners back label reads: ?œThese grapes  were harvested from the lush vineyards of Stanislaus County. ?¦â€?  The Legislature heard evidence of intent, or at least willingness, to expand dramatically the marketing of Napa-named brands,  including the hope of fully utilizing the capacity of the new 18-million-case bottling plant in the City of Napa, to produce wine from  grapes grown outside Napa County. (See transcript of Sen. Governmental Organization Com., hearings on Assem. Bill No. 683  (1999??000 Reg. Sess.) (June 27, 2000), pp. 29 & 31 [responses to questions by Sen. Chesbro].)   Bronco contests the Legislature's findings, asserting that labels such as those set out in the record are not in law or in fact  deceptive because they display a correct appellation of origin. The Legislature's findings to the contrary, however, are supported  both by testimony and survey results presented at the hearings disclosing consumer confusion relating to such labels. Moreover,  as observed at the hearings, an uninformed consumer may not know that an unelaborated term (for example, Lodi) appearing on  a label refers to a geographic location outside Napa County or even that the named location (in contrast to the brand name of  the wine) signifies the place where the grapes used to make the wine actually were grown. Similarly, consumers in restaurants  who order wine by the bottle or the glass from menus may be aware only of the brand name of the wine and generally will not  have an opportunity to read the label of the bottle before placing an order.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
581,"Section 25241  sets out in  subdivision (a)  the findings quoted above, and then  HN1 [ ] provides: ??b) No wine produced, bottled, labeled, offered for sale or sold in California shall use, in a brand name or otherwise, on any  label, packaging material, or advertising, any of the names of viticultural significance listed in subdivision (c), unless that wine  qualifies under Section 4.25a [now section 4.25?”see 68 Federal Register 39454, 39455 (July 2, 2003)] of Title 27 of the Code of  Federal Regulations for the appellation of origin Napa County and includes on the label, packaging material, and advertising that  appellation or a viticultural area appellation of origin that is located entirely within Napa County, subject to compliance with  Section 25240. ?œNotwithstanding the above, this subdivision shall not grant any labeling, packaging, or advertising rights that are prohibited  under federal law or regulations. ??c) The following are names of viticultural significance for purposes of this section:  ??1) Napa. ??2) Any viticultural area appellation of origin established pursuant to Part 9 (commencing with Section 9.1) of Title 27 of the  Code of Federal Regulations that is located entirely within Napa County.  ??3) Any similar name to those in paragraph (1) or (2) that is likely to cause confusion as to the origin of the wine.  ??d) The appellation of origin required by this section shall meet the legibility and size-of-type requirements set forth in either  Section 4.38 or Section 4.63 of Title 27 of the Code of Federal Regulations, whichever is applicable.  ??e) Notwithstanding subdivision (b), any name of viticultural significance may appear either as part of the address required by  Sections 4.35 and 4.62 of Title 27 of the Code of Federal Regulations, if it is also the post office address of the bottling or  producing winery or of the permittee responsible for the advertising, or as part of any factual, nonmisleading statement as to the  history or location of the winery.  ??f) The department may suspend or revoke the license of any person who produces or bottles wine who violates this section.  Following notice of violation to the person in possession of the wine and a hearing to be held within 15 days thereafter, if  requested by any interested party within five days following the notice, the department may seize wine labeled or packaged in  violation of this section regardless of where found, and may dispose of the wine upon order of the department.

Bronco asserts that the statute was drafted in such a manner as to protect other established Napa County wineries, and to  target ?œonly a single brand owner?”Bronco??(and its three grandfathered brands). The record discloses, however, at least 32  other Napa-related ?œgrandfathered??brands (none of which, it appears,  presently  produces any wine that would violate  section  25241 ) that also would be covered by the statute, including the ?œNapa named??brands Napa Wine Cellars, Napa Wine Co., Napa  Cellars, Napa Valley Winery, Napa Vintners, and ?œNapa viticultural appellation??brands Rutherford Hill, Stag's Leap Wine Cellars,  Stags' Leap Winery, Spring Mountain, Mount Veeder Winery, St. Helena Vineyards, and Oakville Vineyards. Bronco also complains that the statute is underinclusive, in that it does not restrict the use of non-Napa brand names, such as  ?œMonterey Vineyards??or ?œSonoma Creek,??nor does it preclude the use of brand labels denoting a viticultural area within Napa,  such as the brand ?œStag's Leap Wine Cellars,??for a Napa County wine made with grapes grown outside the Stags Leap District  of the Napa Valley. (Cf.  Bus. & Prof. Code, Â§ 25240  [requiring such labels to state a ?œNapa Valley??appellation in addition to the  viticultural area within Napa Valley].) Any such underinclusiveness, however, is irrelevant to our present preemption inquiry.    Business and Professions Code section 23090.5   HN4 [ ] divests the superior court of jurisdiction to enjoin or restrain a  decision of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, the agency charged with enforcing  Business and Professions Code  section 25241 .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
583,"Bronco suggests, however, that the state properly may ?œenact an ?˜in-state??version of  section 25241 ?â€”a regulation that would,  presumably, apply only with respect to wine that is not sold in interstate commerce.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bronco, relying upon two Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals decisions (  Lewis v. Brunswick Corp. (11th Cir. 1997) 107 F.3d  1494, 1502 , and   Taylor v. General Motors Corp. (11th Cir. 1989) 875 F.2d 816, 826) , and, to a lesser extent, two high court  decisions (  Geier v. American Honda Motor Co. (2002) 529 U.S. 861, 870??74 [146 L. Ed. 2d 914, 120 S.

Ct. 1756, 1763] (Engine Manufacturers) ), also asserts, as a preliminary matter, that the presumption against preemption  is categorically inapplicable in implied preemption cases such as this, in which the question is whether state law would stand as  an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress. The United States Supreme  Court has not so held, however, and indeed has assumed otherwise. (  Crosby, supra, 530 U.S. 363, 373??74 & fn. 8 .)   Geier , by  contrast, did not even address the presumption-against-preemption doctrine, and in   Engine Manufacturers  the court simply  found it unnecessary, because of its conclusion that the federal legislation  expressly  preempted the relevant state law, to  address the presumption against preemption or even the legislative history of the federal statute. We discern no persuasive  reason why the traditional presumption against preemption should be categorically inapplicable in the present circumstances,  and until the high court directs otherwise, we reject Bronco's view on this point. (See, e.g.,   Philip Morris Inc. v. Harshbarger (1st  Cir. 1997) 122 F.3d 58, 85??6  [applying a ?œstrong presumption against preemption??concerning state health and safety  regulations and finding those regulations not to frustrate congressional purposes].)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
585,"At oral argument, as in the Department's briefs, the NVVA maintained that the ?œrelevant area??for purposes of determining  whether the presumption against preemption is applicable should be viewed as consumer protection related to the labeling of  foods and beverages in general or, more specifically, as consumer protection related to the labeling of wines. Bronco, although  generally challenging the appropriateness of applying any presumption against preemption in this case (see  ante , fn. 12), does  not contest the definition of the relevant area for such an inquiry as proposed by the Department and the NVVA. For purposes of  this opinion, and consistently with the high court's approach in such matters (see, e.g.,   ARC America Corp., supra, 490 U.S. 93,  101  [in addressing whether federal  antitrust law  preempts state law, defining the relevant area as ?œstate common-law and  statutory remedies against monopolies and unfair business practices?]), we view the relevant area as being consumer protection  related to food and beverage labeling, with special emphasis upon wine labeling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
586,"Some state laws of this era regulated the production and labeling of specific items of food such as flour, butter,  oleomargarine, and vinegar. (E.g., Hutt & Hutt,  A History of Government Regulation of Adulteration and Misbranding of Food   (1984) 39 Food Drug Cosm. L.J. 2, 42??4 [citing and describing early Virginia statutes].) During this same period, Congress  enacted similar laws concerning specific food items such as tea, oleomargarine, and meats. ( Id ., at pp. 45??6.)   Citing only the 1895 North Carolina law, Bronco asserts that ?œsome??of these state laws were intended to apply only to food  and beverages sold within a given state. The North Carolina provision, however, is the only such law of which we are aware to  have intimated or specified such a limitation; none of the other laws cited above was so confined, and most instead broadly  applied to foods and beverages that were ?œmanufactured for sale?â€”wherever that sale would occur. But in any event, the  relevant point is that the states (most of them broadly, although in the case of North Carolina, narrowly) exercised their  traditional police powers by specifically regulating the labeling of food products and beverages, including wines.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
587,"As of 1890, those three states produced approximately 60, 10, and 8 percent, respectively, of the wine produced in the United  States. (U.S. Dept. of Interior, Census Off., Rep. of Statistics of Agriculture in the U.S. at the 11th Census: 1890 (1895) p. 602.)   See Pinney, A History of Wine in America (1989) pages 404??05, 420??22 (describing early winemaking in Arkansas and  Oregon).   As observed  ante , footnote 16, by 1890 California produced most of the wine grown and made in the United States. Today,  according  to  the  Wine  Institute,  California  produces  more  than  90  percent  of  the  nation's  wine.  (See  < http://www.wineinstitute.org/communications/statistics/wine_production_key_facts.htm>  [as of Aug. 5, 2004].)  See generally, California Wine Industry,  supra , at pages 26 (?œthe French viticultural journal,  Revue Viticole , in 1862, credited  California with being the only wine-producing area of North America capable of competing with the product from Europe?? and  133 (noting that 35 medals were awarded to California wines at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1889).  In addition?”and belying Bronco's claims that this and similar statutes lacked detail?”the statute contained various other  provisions dealing comprehensively with the production and labeling of wine. (See Stats. 1887, ch. 36, Â§Â§ 3??, pp. 47??9.)  The  Ex parte Kohler  decision proceeded to construe the act's labeling requirements as prohibiting the sale of wines not  meeting the definition of pure wines under the act, but as not subjecting to penalty a merchant who sells wine that is pure but  lacks the required labels. (  Ex parte Kohler, supra, 74 Cal. at pp. 44??5 .)   (1887 Colo. Sess. Laws, Â§ 2, p. 18 et seq.) The legislation required that wine be ?œpure?â€”defined as made from ?œthe juice of  the grape?â€”and specified that ?œ[n]o vinous ??liquors shall be offered or exposed for sale in this State, unless the ??package,  containing such liquors, shall be plainly??marked with ?œthe word ?˜pure??wine,??and displaying ?œthe name or brand of the particular  kind of wine so offered or exposed.??( Id ., Â§Â§ 3 & 4, pp. 18??9.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
588,"(1887 N.Y. Laws, ch. 603, p. 814 et seq.) The New York law was designed to address its specific regional needs as reflected  in the industry practices of New York winemakers who, like those in Europe and other areas of the United States but unlike  those in California, often found it necessary to add sugar in the production of their wines. The law defined and made illegal  adulterated wine, and thereafter defined and required the proper labeling of ?œpure wine,???œhalf wine,??and ?œmade wine.??( Id ., Â§Â§ 1??4, pp. 814??16.) As Bronco observes, the New York provision, as codified in 1889 (N.Y. Pub. Health Law, ch. 25, art. III, Â§Â§ 46??9 (Birdseye  1889)), referred, in its definition of adulterated wines, to those ?œoffered for sale or manufactured with intent to sell within this  state.??( Id ., Â§ 46.) Bronco asserts this and similar phrasing in the statute's penalty provision ( id ., Â§ 49) suggests the New York  statute was intended to apply only to wines sold within the state. There is no evidence that the similar California law mentioned  above, or the Ohio law mentioned below, was so confined or intended. But in any event, the relevant point is that New York?”like  the other states?”exercised its traditional police powers by specifically regulating the labeling of wines.   (1889 Ohio Laws, p. 96 et seq.; 1891 Ohio Laws, p. 231.) As amended in 1891, the Ohio law defined three versions of  permitted wine: ?œpure wine,???œwine,??and ?œcompound wine,??and specifically allowed sugar to be added to the latter two products.  The statute provided that each type of wine ?œshall be ??labeled, designated and sold??as such and made it illegal to label or  package, in a manner ?œcalculated to mislead or deceive any person, or cause to be supposed that the contents thereof be pure  wine,??any product not meeting the definition of pure wine. (1891 Ohio Laws, Â§Â§ 2??, pp. 231??33.)   (1897 Ark. Acts, act 42, Â§ 4, p. 108.) As subsequently amended (1899 Ark. Acts, act 80, pp. 137??38) and codified (Stats. of  Ark., ch. 103, Â§ 5101 (Kirby 1904)), the statute provided: ?œAll wine sold in this State shall, before sale, be labeled so as to truly  designate its kind and quality. Nothing but the pure fermented juice of the grape shall be labeled ?˜Natural Wine.??Wine to which  sugar has been added before fermentation shall be labeled ?˜Sugared Wine.??The label shall also state if the wine be sweetened  or unsweetened.??  (1905 Or. Laws, ch. 209, p. 347 et seq.) The Oregon law defined and barred ?œadulterated wine,??allowed certain amounts of  sugar to be used in the production of ?œpure wine,??and defined and permitted ?œhalf wine??and ?œmade wine,??so long as those  products were labeled as such.

The proposed legislation would have defined  wine as ?œpure,???œcarbonated,??or ?œartificial,??and required labeling as such. (Feb. hearings,  supra , at pp. 5??.) During a second  committee hearing concerning the bill and a revised version of the bill, the committee made clear that in considering the  proposed federal legislation it had consulted the related wine laws of France, Italy, Germany, Ohio, New York, ?œand other  states.??(Apr. hearings,  supra , at pp. 62, 73, 101, 109??12.) A recurring theme during the hearings was the harm posed to the wine industry by the sale of ?œsophisticated and fabricated  wines.??The proponents' stated concern was that if the sale of such products were ?œallowed or countenanced ??in time honest  wine will be driven from the market, ??to the injury of the vineyardists ??.??(Apr. hearings,  supra , at p. 66; see also  id ., at pp.  73??4, 102.)

592,"In this respect, the author of the 1912 treatise relied upon by Bronco observed that ?œthe prohibitions in the California statute ?? against misstatements as to geographical source??were ?œmore detailed??than those under federal law. (American Pure Food and  Drug Laws,  supra , at p. 339.)   In early 1908, California's Department of Public Health adopted comprehensive regulations implementing the 1907 state Act,  broadly regulating ?œfor domestic commerce??the labeling of foods and beverages and specifically providing that ?œ[ t ] he label shall  be free from any statement, design, or device regarding ??place of origin, which is false or misleading in any particular. ??(Cal.  Dept. of Pub. Health, Rules and Regs. for Enforcement of Cal. Pure Foods and Drugs Acts (1909) reg. No. 16, p. 22, italics  added.)

No. 13(d) & (e), p. 20 [providing as quoted above,  and further providing that food or beverages shall not be ?œlabeled or branded in such a manner as to deceive or mislead the  consumer?]; Cal.

See American Pure Food and Drug Laws,  supra , listing, as of 1912, the following additional states that had adopted the  Secretary of Agriculture's food (and wine) standards, or essentially identical standards: Alabama (at p. 270); Delaware (at p.  418); Florida (at p. 438); Georgia (at pp. 468??74); Idaho (at p. 499); Illinois (at pp. 524??25); Indiana (at p. 551); Kansas (at pp.  604??05); Kentucky (at pp. 634??35); Louisiana (at pp. 661??62); Maine (at pp. 680??81); Maryland (at pp. 705??06);  Mississippi (at pp. 828??29); Missouri (at p. 851); Montana (at p. 880); Nevada (at p. 932); New Hampshire (at p. 952); New  Jersey (at p. 980); North Carolina (at p. 1051); Oklahoma (at p. 1128); Rhode Island (at pp. 1207??208); South Dakota (at p.  1241); Texas (at p. 1285); Utah (at p. 1306); Virginia (at pp. 1350??351); Wisconsin (at pp. 1416??417); and Wyoming (at p.  1441). (See also  Interpretative Regulations, supra,  29 Geo. L.J. at p. 13 & fn. 27.)   Effective through at least 1935, the state's 1907 Pure Foods Act continued to adopt?”as  minimum  standards?”the federal  food standards (including the wine standards).

593,"In 1932, anticipating ratification of the repeal of Prohibition, California voters passed a constitutional amendment, providing as  follows: ??HN8 [ ] The State of California, subject to the internal revenue laws of the United States, shall have the exclusive right  and power to license and regulate  the manufacture , sale, purchase, possession and transportation of alcoholic beverages within  the State, and subject to the laws of the United States regulating commerce between foreign nations and among the states shall  have the exclusive right and power to regulate the importation into and  exportation from the State , of alcoholic beverages. ?¦â€? ( Cal. Const., art XX, Â§ 22 , italics added.)   At that same time, the Legislature repealed the 1907 ?œCala??wine labeling statute. (See Stats. 1935, ch. 330, Â§ 69, p. 1152;  Caddow,  Permanent Wine Labeling Regulations  in Wines & Vines (Feb. 1936) 10.) The 1887 state ?œpure wine??labeling statute  (Stats. 1887, ch. 36, p. 46) previously had been repealed in 1911. (Stats. 1911, ch. 587, Â§ 1, p. 1110.) Of course, despite these  repeals, the state's 1907 Pure Foods Act (Stats. 1907, ch. 181, p. 208 et seq.), which as noted above incorporated specific wine  standards, and the regulations adopted under the 1907 Act (all described  ante , pt. II.B.1.d.), remained in effect and prohibited  the mislabeling of wine.  Contrary to assertions in Bronco's supplemental briefs, there is no indication that the scope of the 1934 regulations was  limited to wine sold to consumers in California and that the regulations did not address wines destined for interstate commerce.   The regulation provided: ??Champagne  is a light white sparkling wine identical with champagne as made in the Champagne  district in France in respect to composition and basic manufacturing principle. If the secondary fermentation is not within the  bottle, there shall be stated in direct conjunction with the word ?˜Champagne??the words ?˜Secondary Fermentation in Bulk.????(1934  Regs., at p. 2.) The regulations also provided specific labeling requirements for artificially carbonated wines: ?œThe word  ?˜carbonated??should be in the same color [and] style of type on the same colored background as the wine described.??( Ibid .)   The regulations also restricted the use, on wine labels, of statements of age and the word ?œold??(1934 Regs., at pp. 2??), and  further required that any product made from pomace be labeled ?œIMITATION WINE/ Made of Wine Pomace, Water and Sugar?? ( id ., at p. 2).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
594,"The original Ohio wine law (1889 Ohio Laws, p. 96 et seq.) was, by 1938, codified in Page's Ohio Revised Code Annotated  (Anderson 1938) title II, chapter 1, sections 5795??805. Oregon's 1905 wine labeling statute (1905 Or. Laws, ch. 209, Â§Â§ 54??6,  pp. 361??62) was reenacted a decade later (1915 Or. Laws, ch. 343, Â§Â§ 41??3, pp. 570??71) and apparently still was effective  through mid-1937, when Oregon adopted post-Prohibition-repeal wine labeling regulations. (See also Or. Liquor Control Admin.  (1937) reg. 5(c) [specifically enforcing the California wine regulations discussed above] & 6 [setting forth labeling requirements].)  For example, the food and beverage labeling statutes of Massachusetts, North Dakota, and Washington, described  ante , part  II.B.1.a, each remained in force in 1935, as revised, and each defined as ?œmisbranded??any food or drink label bearing ?œany  statement, design or device??that was ?œfalse or misleading in any particular,??or any item ?œfalsely branded as to the state or  country where it was manufactured or produced,??or very similar words to that effect. (See  1932 Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 94, Â§Â§  186 , 187; 1923 N.D. Laws, ch. 222, Â§Â§ 4, 6, pp. 289??91; Rev. Stats. of Wash. (Remington 1932) tit. 40, Â§Â§ 6145, 6147; see  also Rev. Stats. of Wash.,  supra , Â§ 6137 [adopting the federal food standards, including wine standards, as minimum  standards].)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
595,"In New York, Colorado, and Arkansas, the previous wine-specific labeling statutes described  ante , part II.B.1.b, had given way,  by 1935, to the states' respective general food and beverage mislabeling/misbranding regulations, all of which regulated both  food and drink. (See N.Y. Agric. & Mkts. Law, ch. 1, art. 17, Â§ 200 (Cahill 1930); Ann. Stats. of Colo., ch. 1, Â§ 6 (Courtright 1930);  Stats. of Ark., ch. 69, Â§ 4823 (1919).) There is no indication, with respect to any of these changes in the various states' laws, that  any diminution of state regulatory authority over the labeling of wines thereby was intended or effected.   For the reasons set forth above, we also reject Bronco's related assertion, pressed in its supplemental briefs and at oral  argument, that no presumption against preemption applies here because, Bronco claims, the states' regulatory activity was  augmented in the early 20th century by a ?œsignificant federal presence.??(See   Locke, supra, 529 U.S. 89, 108  [finding no  presumption against preemption regarding regulation of maritime vessels].) As explained  ante , part II.B.1, prior to adoption of the  FAA Act in 1935 , the federal role with respect to wine label regulation was neither dominant nor particularly significant in  comparison with that of the states?”and in any event, unlike the situation in   Locke , federal activity in the field of wine label  regulation certainly was not ?œmanifest since the beginning of our Republic.??(  Locke, supra, at p. 99 .)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
596,"As originally enacted, the statute referred to the ?œAdministrator??of the ?œFederal Alcohol Administration.??That agency was  abolished, and its functions were directed to be administered by the Secretary of the Treasury through the Bureau of Internal  Revenue (now the Internal Revenue Service) in the Department of the Treasury. (See  27 U.S.C. Â§ 201 , Transfer of Functions.)  Thereafter, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) was established in 1972 and given the pertinent functions of  the Internal Revenue Service with regard to wine regulation. ( Ibid .) Subsequently, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 ( 6 U.S.C.  Â§ 101 ) transferred responsibility for the regulation of interstate commerce in alcoholic beverages to a newly formed Alcohol and  Tobacco Tax Trade Bureau within the Department of the Treasury. (68 Fed.Reg. 3744 (Jan. 24, 2003).) For convenience, and  because the regulations here at issue were adopted by the BATF, we shall continue to refer in this case to the BATF as the  responsible regulatory agency.   In the Tobacco Inspection Act (Pub.L. No. 74-314 (Aug. 23, 1935) 49 Stat. 731)?”enacted six days prior to adoption of the  FAA Act ?”Congress used language making very clear its intent to adopt ?œuniform??national standards that would displace state  regulation, thereby revealing that when the 74th Congress intended to make its regulation exclusive, it knew how to do so. As  observed in   Florida Avocado, supra, 373 U.S. 132, 147 , with regard to the Tobacco Act, ?œCongress had declared ?˜uniform  standards of classification and inspection??to be ?˜imperative for the protection of producers and others engaged in commerce and  the public interest therein.??[Citation.] The legislative history was replete with references to a need for ?˜uniform??or ?˜official??
597,standards", which could harmonize the grading and inspection of tobacco at all markets throughout the country. Under the statute  a single set of standards was to be promulgated by the Secretary of Agriculture, ?˜and the standards so established would be the  official standards of the United States for such purpose.????No such language or comparable provision appears in the  FAA Act , as  adopted in 1935.  See also House of Representatives Report No. 1542 (74th Cong., 1st Sess.) pages 13??4 (July 17, 1935) (citing the  FAA  Act ?˜s ?œrelabeling??provision and noting that anticipated regulations would permit ?œappropriate additional labeling requirements  imposed by a State pursuant to its own law not in conflict with the Federal requirements??. Bronco asserts that by this relabeling  provision (see 27 C.F.R. Â§ 4.30(b)(1)) and the cited comment, Congress had in mind only the authority of states, pursuant to the  Twenty-first Amendment , to impose additional labeling requirements on alcoholic products imported for sale from other states,  and did not contemplate that a state would be permitted to impose additional labeling requirements on wines destined for  interstate commerce. We find no persuasive evidence of any such intent, however.   Although on occasion we have questioned reliance upon the views of individual legislators as a basis upon which to discern  the intent of the state Legislature (e.g.,   People v. Dennis (1998) 17 Cal.4th 468,501, fn. 7 [71 Cal. Rptr. 2d 680, 950 P.2d  1035] , and cases cited), in the present case Bronco does not challenge Representative Cullen's statements on that ground, and  we recently observed in   Dowhal, supra, 32 Cal.4th 910 , that  HN12 [ ] statements by a single member of Congress ???˜can  provide evidence of Congress??intent.' ??(  Id., at p. 926, fn. 6 .) Moreover, in the present case there are strong reasons to rely  upon the quoted statements. Representative Cullen was the author of the  FAA Act , and was looked upon as an authority during  the House debates, fielding many questions from his colleagues. (E.g., Remarks of Rep. Doughton, 79 Cong. Rec. (1935) 11713  [Rep. Doughton, author of a prior version of the bill, observing on the House floor that Rep.

Cullen's  various responses to questions, etc.].) In addition, Representative Cullen's comments essentially reiterated that which was set  out in the House Report of the Ways and Means Committee, cited in the text above?”and later incorporated into the Senate  Report of the Committee on Finance on House Resolution No. 8870 (Fed. Alcohol Control Admin., Legis. History of Fed. Alcohol  Admin. Act (Sept. 15, 1935) appen. IV, p. 166), and hence the cited comments did not amount merely to expressions of personal  opinion.

Â§Â§ 4.23, 4.24, 4.28 .)  As Bronco concedes, California long has enforced regulations that differ from the federal regulations with respect to method of  manufacture. (See, e.g.,  Cal.

599,"from federal regulations with what it contends are impermissible deviations from federal  labeling  standards?”especially federal  regulations concerning the use of brand names on labels.

Despite the efforts of librarians  throughout the state, we have been unable to locate the intervening  regulations ?”if indeed there were any?”or the 1940 Rules  Governing California Vintage Wines. Article III, section 12(1) of the 1942 Regulations also provided, consistently with many of the prior statutes and regulations  described earlier, that wine labels ?œshall not contain [Â¶] (1)  any statement, design, device or representation which is false or  misleading in any material particular .??(Italics added.)   That California regulation, as adopted in the early 1940s, was in force until the mid-1980s. (See former Cal. Admin. Code, tit.  17, Â§Â§ 17001(a) & 17075(c)(2) (1978).) Oregon as well had a similar ?œcoined??brand-name provision until the mid-1980s. (See  Or. Admin. R. 845-10-285(3)(a) (1978).)   The appellation ?œCalifornia Central Coast counties??has since fallen into disuse. (See  Regulation of American Wine Labeling,  supra , 11 U.C. Davis L.Rev. at p. 143.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
600,"See Statutes 1939, chapter 60 (establishing the Health & Safety Code), page 992 (enacting former  Â§ 26541 , requiring that  certain state food and distilled spirits regulations not impose a standard higher than certain federal regulations?”but  not  requiring  such conformity with regard to state  wine  regulations); Statutes 1941, chapter 1042, section 3, page 2698 (enacting former  Â§  26540.2 , authorizing the State Board of Health to promulgate wine regulations), and section 4, page 2699 (amending  Â§ 26541  to  specify that the section's general prohibition on imposition of higher state standards concerning food and distilled spirits ??shall  not apply to wine ??. (Italics added.) Former  section 26541 ?˜s exemption of state wine regulations from the general rule against  imposition of higher state standards relating to other foods and distilled spirits continued through various amendments of that  former section, until that exemption ultimately was recast in 1970 as a positive right of state regulators to ?œdiffer from or be  inconsistent with??corresponding federal wine regulations. (Stats. 1970, ch. 1573, Â§ 5, p. 3255; see  post , fn. 53 [quoting current  Health & Saf. Code, Â§ 110525 ]; cf.   44 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 122, 125 (1964)  [discussing similar history of Health & Saf. Code,  former Â§ 26542].)   In 1970, Health and Safety Code former  section 26515  was amended to specify: ?œStandards of identity and quality for wine  adopted pursuant to this section  may differ from or be inconsistent with  the standards promulgated by [the federal regulators in  the Department of the Treasury].??(Stats. 1970, ch. 1573, Â§ 5, p. 3255, italics added.) The statute today provides the same.  ( Health & Saf. Code, Â§ 110525   HN15 [ ] [?œStandards of identity and quality for wine adopted pursuant to this section may differ  from or be inconsistent with the standards promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the  Federal Alcohol  Administration Act ?].)   Indeed, other jurisdictions, since 1976, expressly have recognized and incorporated California's more stringent ??00 percent  rule??into their own state wine regulations (see 16 Tex. Admin. Code, Â§ 45.45(b) & (c) (eff. Jan. 1976) [?œall grape wine bearing  labels showing ?˜California??as the origin of such wine shall be derived 100 % from grapes grown and wine from such grapes  fermented within the State of California?];  Wash. Admin. Code, Â§ 314-24-003(5)  [same]), and the federal regulating body itself  has recognized California's ??00 percent rule??as a valid exercise of state regulatory power. (See 58 Fed.Reg. 65295, 65297  (Dec. 14, 1993) [acknowledging ?œCalifornia's authority to enforce its own labeling requirements within the area of its  jurisdiction?].)   Under the then existing federal regulations, use of geographic brand names was permitted if (i) the word ?brand??appeared  after the brand name ( 27 C.F.R. Â§ 4.33(b) (1976) ) or (ii) at least 75 percent of the grapes originated in the appellation suggested  by the brand name ( id .,  Â§ 4.25 (1976) ).   Although the BATF in 1978 adopted new rules regulating the use in brand names of terms of geographic or viticultural  significance, it delayed implementation of those rules, first until 1983 and ultimately until 1986. (43 Fed.Reg. 37672, 37674,  37678 (Aug. 23, 1978).) The brand-name rules that were adopted in 1978 (but never became effective) would have provided: ?œA  brand name of viticultural significance may not be used unless the bottling winery is located within the geographical area used in  the brand name, and the wine meets the appellation of origin requirements for the area named??(meaning at least 75 percent of",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
601,"the grapes used to make the wine must be from that area). (43 Fed.Reg. 37672, 37678 (Aug. 23, 1978).) Alternatively, the 1978  regulation, as initially adopted, would have permitted use of a brand name of viticultural significance if ?œthe brand name is  qualified by the word ?˜brand??immediately following the brand name in the same size of type and as conspicuous as the brand  name itself.??( Ibid .)  As noted, implementation of the brand-name aspects of the rules repeatedly was delayed. (See 48 Fed.Reg. 2762 (Jan. 21,  1983); 50 Fed.Reg. 758 (Jan. 7, 1985).) Meanwhile, in 1984 the BATF retreated from its 1978 proposal concerning the use of  brand names and proposed instead to address the issue by adopting either that plan, or one of three alternative plans. (49  Fed.Reg. 19330, 19331??9332 (May 7, 1984); see  post , fn. 70 [describing the BATF's 1984 comments concerning proposed  branding rules].) As explained below, based upon further review and the comments concerning its 1984 proposal, the BATF  ultimately adopted, effective July 7, 1986, the regulation at issue in the present case. (51 Fed.Reg. 20480 (June 5, 1986).)   An ?œappellation of origin??was, and continues to be, defined as a political division or subdivision?”for example, a state, or  group of states, or a county, or group of counties?”in which grapes used to make a wine are grown. (See  27 C.F.R. Â§  4.25(a)(1)(i)-(vi) .) A ?œviticultural area,??by contrast, is a special subcategory within an appellation of origin (see  27 C.F.R. Â§  4.25(a)(1)(vi) ) demarked not by political boundaries, but by geographic terms and characteristics.   The other requirements for ?œviticultural area appellation??labeling were (and remain) (i) that the area be recognized under part  9 of 27 Code of Federal Regulations; (ii) that the wine be made from at least 85 percent grapes grown in that viticultural area;  and (iii) that the wine be fully ?œfinished??within the state (or one of the states) of the viticultural area. ( 27 C.F.R. Â§ 4.25(e)(3)(i), (ii)  & (iv) .)   An administrative regulation of the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (former Or. Admin. R. 845-10-292(6)(c), eff. Mar. 1,  1977, currently Or. Admin. R. 845-010-0920(1) & (2) (2004)), requires: ??1) An appellation of origin must appear on every wine  brand label in direct conjunction with, and in lettering as conspicuous as, the wine's class or type designation. The lettering must  be at least two millimeters in height. [Â¶] (2) No person may sell or offer to sell a wine, claiming or implying a certain appellation of  origin anywhere on its label, unless 100 percent of the grapes used in its production grew within the legal boundaries of that  appellation of origin. ?¦â€?The corresponding federal regulations, by contrast, impose only a 75 percent rule for appellations of  origin ( 27 C.F.R. Â§ 4.25(b)(1)(i) ), an 85 percent rule for American viticultural areas ( 27 C.F.R. Â§ 4.25(e)(3)(ii) ), and a 95 percent  rule for individual vineyard appellations ( 27 C.F.R. Â§ 4.39(m) ).   Compare Oregon Administrative Rule 845-10-292(5), effective March 1, 1977, currently Oregon Administrative Rule 845-010- 0930 (2004) (barring use of ?œsemi-generic??place names [such as Burgundy, Chablis, and Chianti] on Oregon wine labels) with  27 Code of Federal Regulations section 4.24(b)(2)  (permitting those same names on federally approved labels).   Compare Oregon Administrative Rule 845-10-292(3)(a), effective March 1, 1977, currently Oregon Administrative Rule 845- 010-0915(1) (2004) (a varietal name [such as Chardonnay or Pinot Noir] may not be used on an Oregon wine label unless at  least 90 percent of the wine's grapes are of that varietal) with  27 Code of Federal Regulations section 4.23(b)  (permitting use of  a varietal name on federally approved labels if only 75 percent of the wine's grapes are of that varietal).   Compare Oregon Administrative Rule 845-10-292(4)(c), effective March 1, 1977, currently Oregon Administrative Rule 845- 010-0925 (2004) (barring use of the term ?œestate bottled??on Oregon wine labels unless, among other things, the wine's grapes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
602,"were grown within five miles of the winery) with  27 Code of Federal Regulations section 4.26  (permitting the term ?œestate bottled?? on federally approved labels without requiring that the wine's grapes have been grown within five miles of the winery).   See Oregon Administrative Rule 845-10-292(6)(e), effective March 1, 1977, currently Oregon Administrative Rule 845-010- 0920(4)(f) (2004), discussed in the text,  post .   See Oregon Administrative Rule 845-10-290(2) (1977), currently Oregon Administrative Rule 845-010-0290(2) (2004)  (providing that each wine label must (i) receive a federal COLA  and  (ii) comply with the more stringent Oregon rules concerning  percentage contents for appellations of origin, semi-generic names, grape content of varietal wines, brand names, and use of  the term ?œestate bottled??.   We note the narrowness of this grandfather provision compared with the federal grandfather clause that we consider in the  present case. In addition to the earlier cutoff date (1977 under the state regulation, as compared with 1986 under the federal  regulation), the phrasing of the provision suggests that the right of grandfathered use may not be transferred to another entity, as  was done in the present case. (Cf. Comment,  On Vino Veritas Clarifying the Use of Geographic References on American Wine  Labels  (2001)   89 Cal. L.Rev. 1881, 1912??913 .)   As most recently amended, the regulation provides that appellation names?”again including the names of Oregon counties,  and the names of Oregon wine-producing regions Willamette Valley, Umpqua Valley, and Rogue Valley or ?œwords that may be  mistaken for an approved appellation of origin in a brand name [or] in a winery name, or in any other manner on a wine label?? may not be used ?œunless the wine meets the requirements for use of that appellation of origin??(Or. Admin. R. 845-010-0920(4)(f)  (2004)), that is, ??00 percent of the grapes used in its production grew within the legal boundaries of that appellation of origin.?? ( Id ., 845-010-0920(2) (2004).) Like the original version of the regulation, the provision also retains a restrictive grandfather  clause: ?œA winery may continue to use any brand name that  it has used  on its approved label since before  January 1, 1977 .??( Id .,  845-010-0920(4)(f) (2004), italics added.)   We reject Bronco's preliminary argument, raised in its supplemental briefs, that Oregon Administrative Rule 845-010-0280  implicitly nullifies Oregon wine regulations discussed above, such as the estate-bottled provision and the geographic brand- name provision. The cited rule addresses ?œStandards of Identity and Prohibited Practices Concerning Wine??and provides that Oregon regulations  concerning those two topics, set forth in Oregon Administrative Rule ??45-010-0905 [definitions]  and  845-010-0940 [use of  water, wine spirits and other sweetening agents],??shall prevail over any less stringent or restrictive federal law. (Or. Admin. R.  845-010-0280 (2004), italics added.) As Bronco observes, in an introductory sentence the regulation  also  states: ?œThe  Commission adopts, by reference, 27 CFR [parts] 4 [the federal wine labeling regulations] and 24[] [wineries and wine-making  regulations] (1986). These regulations of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco [] and Firearms of the United States Department of  Treasury apply to all wine sold in Oregon by a Commission licensee.??( Ibid .)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
603,"Bronco reads this language as adopting generally the federal regulations concerning, for example, the use of the term ?œestate  bottled??and geographic brand names for all Oregon wines sold in that state?”and hence as implicitly repealing or at least  superseding those Oregon rules insofar as in-state sales of Oregon wines are concerned. Bronco's interpretation of the Oregon  rules is belied by Oregon Administrative Rule 845-010-0910(2) (2004), which plainly states that Oregon Administrative Rules  ??45-010-0905  through  845-010-0940 [i.e., including Oregon's estate-bottled and geographic brand-name provisions] apply to all  grape wines  produced or bottled in Oregon  ?¦â€â€”that is, regardless where such wines are  sold ?”and that ?œ[ t ] hese rules prevail in  any conflict between ??other rules in Chapter 845, Division 010 .??(Italics added.)   As the BATF explained, prior to adoption of its 1978 appellation rules, appellations of origin relating to American wines  generally were characterized as regions or places delimited by political boundaries, such as states or counties. As observed  ante , at footnote 57, the 1978 appellation rules expanded the concept of appellations of origin by additionally including under  that term ?œviticultural areas?â€”that is, grape-growing regions?”defined by geographic features, and not political lines. Because  some of these viticultural areas straddled states, a problem eventually arose concerning the federal requirement, then set out in  27 Code of Federal Regulations former section 4.25a(e)(3)(v) (1981??986), that in order to employ a viticultural area  designation, a winery must ?œconform[] to the laws and regulations of all the States contained in the viticultural area.??Specifically,  the BATF noted (51 Fed.Reg. 3773, 3774 (Jan. 30, 1986)), if a wine were to use the viticultural area designation ?œColumbia  Valley??(a federally recognized viticultural area straddling Oregon and Washington), the winery producing the wine would be  required to comply with Oregon's state regulations, even if the grapes were grown in the Washington part of the Columbia Valley  and the wine was made and finished only in Washington. Moreover, the BATF observed, ?œregulations of Oregon and Washington  differ greatly regarding the production  and labeling  of wine.  Oregon regulations are more stringent than Federal regulations .??(51  Fed.Reg. 3773, 3774 (Jan. 30, 1986), italics added.) The BATF observed that because former section ??.25a(e)(3)(v) required  compliance with laws and regulations of all states within a multistate viticultural area, regardless of where the wine is fermented  or finished, wine made from grapes originating and fermented in Washington, and finished and bottled within Washington was,  nevertheless, subjected to Oregon law and regulations if the wine claimed a multistate viticultural area appellation such as  Columbia Valley.??(51 Fed.Reg. 3773, 3774 (Jan. 30, 1986).) And yet, the BATF determined, ?œ[a]  Federal requirement  for  compliance with State laws and regulations is both unnecessary and difficult for the Federal Government to enforce  due to the  multitude of state and local laws and regulations .??( Ibid ., italics added.) Accordingly, the BATF concluded, it did not ?œbelieve that  Federal regulation should impose the State laws or regulations of one state upon transactions occurring in other states.??( Ibid .)   Underscoring this point, the BATF observed in the summary of its decision that although ?œthe requirement to comply with  State laws and regulations is removed as a Federal requirement,??still, ?œ[t]he State laws and regulations remain in effect and  will",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
604,"continue to be enforced by the agencies of the states involved in winemaking .??(51 Fed.Reg. 3773 (Jan. 30, 1986), italics  added.)   See  27 Code of Federal Regulations section 4.39(i) , quoted in full  ante , at footnote 7. As Bronco observes, in a notice of  proposed rulemaking issued in 1984?”two years prior to the BATF's adoption of the present brand-name provision and its  grandfather clause?”the BATF stated that it did not wish to adopt a regulation that ?œmay be too restrictive.??(49 Fed.Reg. 19330,  19331 (May 7, 1984).) After outlining four possible regulatory responses to the brand-name problem, the BATF stated, in  reference to a possible rule strictly regulating the use of terms of viticultural significance in brand names, its ?œbelie[f that] the wine  industry should be allowed flexibility in selecting brand names under which to market their products  without having a whole class  of brand names become totally unusable .??( Id ., at pp. 19331??9332, italics added.) As explained  post , part II.D.1, Bronco  suggests that this language supports a conclusion that two years later, when the BATF adopted  27 Code of Federal Regulations  section 4.39(i)(2)(ii)  and concluded that the new rule ?œwill provide the industry with sufficient flexibility in designing their labels,  while at the same time providing consumers with protection from any misleading impressions that might arise from the use of  geographic brand names??(51 Fed.Reg. 20480, 20482 (June 5, 1986)), the BATF, in so acting, engaged in a ?œcareful balancing  of federal policy objectives??and intended to  allow  the kind of brand-name labeling here at issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
608,"We note that the BATF has not been reluctant to commit its thoughts to public view through publication of proposed rules and  related comments in the Federal Register.   For similar reasons, we find unpersuasive the related arguments of amici curiae on behalf of Bronco that  section 25241   stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress, because the statute  assertedly (i) ?œimpairs the long-standing national policy favoring uniform and consistent federal wine labeling regulations,??(ii)  ?œimpairs the consistent federal policy permitting continued use of established brands,??and (iii) ?œwill frustrate the United States'  ability to protect established brands and trademarks in ongoing trade negotiations.??

Manufacturers argue that  Hanover Shoe, supra, 392 U.S. 481 , is not evidence of textual ambiguity because it was not a  statutory interpretation case. We disagree. The United States Supreme Court itself has indicated  Hanover Shoe  resolved ?œa  question of statutory interpretation,??namely, the ?œproper construction of Â§ 4 of the Clayton Act [ 15 U.S.C.

Rptr. 849, 444 P.2d 481] ) and ?œauthoritative??( Shasta Douglas Oil Co. v. Work (1963) 212 Cal. App.  2d 618, 625 [28 Cal. Rptr. 190] ) on Cartwright Act questions. Consequently, the Legislature feared  Illinois Brick 's rule would be  applied equally to the Cartwright Act. (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 3222 (1977??978 Reg. Sess.) as  introduced Mar. 27, 1978, p. 1 [bill introduced to ?œprevent a federal case interpretation of the Sherman Act precluding an indirect  purchaser's standing to sue in antitrust actions [i.e.,  Illinois Brick ] being applied to actions under the Cartwright Act?];  id.  at p. 2  [explaining the bill was needed because federal antitrust decisions like  Illinois Brick  were ?œconsidered ?˜persuasive??in interpreting  the provisions of the Cartwright Act?].)  California was not alone in this. To date, 25 states and the District of Columbia have passed  Illinois Brick  repealer statutes;  numerous others have interpreted existing state law to   [****51]  allow indirect purchaser suits. (Karon, ??Your Honor, Tear Down  that Illinois Brick Wall!??The National Movement Toward Indirect Purchaser Antitrust Standing and Consumer Justice  (2004)  30  Wm. Mitchell L.Rev. 1351, 1361??362 .) The Cartwright Act amendment and other like  Illinois Brick  repealer statutes have  subsequently been upheld against preemption challenges. ( California v. ARC America Corp., supra, 490 U.S. at pp. 105??06 .)  These implementation problems were those that would arise if indirect purchaser suits were permitted at the same time that  Hanover Shoe 's bar on a pass-on defense remained in place. (See  Illinois Brick, supra, 431 U.S. at pp. 737?747  (maj. opn.);  id.  at pp. 761??64  (dis. opn.).)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
663,"In a closely related vein, we previously have approved the use of fluid recovery funds under the Cartwright Act precisely  because they   [****56]  might be the only way to ?œensure that the policies of disgorgement or deterrence are realized??and  because Cartwright Act defendants should not be ?œpermitted to retain ill gotten gains simply because their conduct harmed large  numbers of people in small amounts instead of small numbers of people in large amounts.??( State of California v.

664,"Co. (1986) 41 Cal.3d 460, 472 [224 Cal. Rptr. 605, 715 P.2d 564] .) The same considerations are in play here, where rejection of  the  Hanover Shoe  rule would allow alleged antitrust violators to escape without sanction.  Indeed, the possibility that in this latter scenario Pharmacies did  not  lose sales as a result of the alleged price-fixing conspiracy  rests on the rather unlikely proposition that cash-paying customers' demand for drugs is wholly inelastic to price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
665,"Manufacturers argue, and the Court of Appeal agreed, that Pharmacies waived these other forms of injury. The record does  not support this claim. Pharmacies expressly did not concede that they had suffered no other injuries as a result of the alleged  price-fixing conspiracy. Rather, they waived any attempt to prove other injuries because those injuries' existence and measure  were legally irrelevant under  Hanover   [****61]  Shoe , the rule Pharmacies contended applied under the Cartwright Act. As we  agree that  Hanover Shoe  applies, we need not consider whether, had we concluded it did not, Pharmacies should have been  permitted to prove injuries other than the overcharge in this case. (Cf.  B.W.I. Custom Kitchen v. Owens-Illinois, Inc., supra, 191  Cal. App. 3d at p. 1353  [if the pass-on defense applies, plaintiffs should have the opportunity to prove other injuries].)  We are aware of no statute or case that adopts such an in-between rule, and Manufacturers have cited none. The irrationality  of such a rule is inferable as well from the United States Supreme Court's own precedents. To prevail on a pass-on defense in  those rare instances   [****63]  where it has been permitted under federal law, a defendant must show the plaintiff could not have  raised rates otherwise ( Kansas v. UtiliCorp United Inc., supra, 497 U.S. at p. 209 ;  Hanover Shoe, supra, 392 U.S. at p. 493, fn.  9 ) and did not lose sales, because the quantity to be purchased was controlled by a preexisting ?œcost-plus??contract ( Kansas v.  UtiliCorp United Inc., at p. 218 ;  Illinois Brick, supra, 431 U.S. at p. 736 ;  Hanover Shoe, at p. 494 ; see also Hovenkamp,  The  Indirect-Purchaser Rule and Cost-Plus Sales  (1990)  103 Harv. L.Rev. 1717, 1720  [cost-plus contracts involve both a fixed  markup and a fixed quantity to be delivered]). In essence, Supreme Court precedent recognizes that a pass-on defense (based  on evidence of secondary consequences) is only presentable in circumstances that foreclose the possibility of tertiary  consequences (lost sales and profits). Only then can one fairly say in defense that the plaintiff has suffered no injury as the  result of an illegal overcharge. In contrast, in stable markup cases such as this one, where a purchaser's resale price is fixed as a direct function of its  acquisition price so as to pass on any overcharge, the resale market's  response    [****64]  to that overcharge-inflated resale price  is  not  fixed and may be different than it would have been in the absence of the overcharge?”and that different response (e.g.,  lower sales) may injure the plaintiff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
667,"Doing so would render the UCL's standing requirement substantially  more  stringent than other state unfair competition statutes  such as the Cartwright Act, under which Pharmacies' standing is undisputed. Again, we see nothing in the text or history of  Proposition 64 that suggests the voters intended such a result.  In this court, Manufacturers argue that Pharmacies have waived reliance on their complaint's request for injunctive relief to  defeat summary adjudication. This argument misplaces the relevant burden. If Manufacturers sought summary judgment on the  ground Pharmacies could obtain no relief on their UCL claim, it was incumbent on Manufacturers, as the moving party, to show  that each form of relief sought by Pharmacies was unavailable. While Manufacturers attempted that showing with respect to the  request for restitution, their moving papers simply ignored Pharmacies' request for injunctive relief.  In any event, the issue whether the availability of injunctive relief bars summary adjudication was decided by the Court of Appeal  and fully briefed before us by the parties. It involves  HN9 [ ] a pure issue of law, reviewable de novo. We may exercise our  discretion to consider it. (See  People v. Superior Court (Laff) (2001) 25 Cal.4th 703, 712, fn. 3 [107 Cal.

Because  [****46]   the Cipro settlement involved cash, we need not  define precisely what noncash forms of consideration will qualify, but courts considering Cartwright Act claims should not let  creative variations in the form of consideration result in the purchase of freedom from competition escaping detection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

707,"Here, the brand, Bayer, settled out of the antitrust case, and Barr would not be in a superior position with regard to knowledge  of Bayer's future patent litigation costs, so the burden of production on this point would remain with plaintiffs.

This point also addresses Barr's argument that causation is lacking in reverse payment cases because absent a settlement,  the parties would have litigated, the patentee would likely or surely have won, and consumers would have been no better off.

736,"Opinion The unfair competition law is set forth at  Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq.  Although the Legislature has  not given an official name to these statutory provisions, the legislation has generally been referred to as the unfair competition  law, and we will refer to this statute as the UCL. (See  Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co.  (1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 169, fn. 2 [83 Cal. Rptr. 2d 548, 973 P.2d 527]  ( Cel-Tech ).) The FAL is set forth at  Business and Professions Code section 17500 et seq.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
737,"As initially filed, the complaint also alleged that Nationwide's practices violated the Check Sellers, Bill Payers and Proraters  Law ( Fin. Code, Â§ 12200 et seq. ) and asserted causes of action under that statute. While this case was pending before this  court, those causes of action were dismissed as part of a larger settlement between the Department of Business Oversight and  Nationwide. The underlying action now rests solely on the causes of action under the UCL and the FAL set forth in the  complaint. In the action brought by the CFPB, the federal district court, after a seven-day bench trial, found that although some of the  claims advanced by the CFPB were not meritorious, Nationwide had made a variety of misleading statements in its marketing  materials. The court imposed injunctive relief and civil penalties of more than $7 million against Nationwide based on that  misleading conduct. ( Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v. Nationwide Biweekly Administration, Inc. (N.D.Cal., Sept. 8,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Case Nos. 18-15431 & 18-15887, filed Mar. 15,  2018, & May 10, 2018.) In the answer brief filed in this court, Nationwide claims that the government seeks to impose ?œover $19.25  billion  in civil  penalties.??The complaint, however, seeks no specific amount in penalties, and, as explained hereafter, the applicable statutes  and case law grant trial courts broad, but not unlimited, discretion to impose penalties in a reasonable amount (up to $2,500 per  violation) in light of the nature and severity of an offending business's conduct. ( Post , at pp. 299, 307, 313.) The answer's  hyperbole in this regard does not advance its legal argument.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
740,"The 1933 amendment also defined ?œunfair competition??to include any violation of the then-existing provisions of  Penal Code  former sections 654a ,  654b , or  654c , all of which prohibited different specific forms of false advertising. (Stats. 1933, ch. 953, Â§  1, p. 2482 [ Civ. Code, former Â§ 3369, subd. (3) ].) In the statewide election held in November 2004, the voters approved Proposition 64, an initiative statute that restricted the  kinds of private plaintiffs that may seek an injunction or other equitable relief under the UCL or the FAL ( Bus. & Prof. Code, Â§Â§",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
741,"17203 ,  17204 ,  17535 ) and provided that the revenue from the civil penalties imposed under the UCL or the FAL may be used  only by the Attorney General and local public prosecutors for the enforcement of consumer protection laws. ( Bus. & Prof. Code,  Â§Â§ 17206, subd. (c) ,  17536, subd. (c) .) The changes effectuated by Proposition 64 have no direct bearing on the issue before us. The very broad consumer protective language set forth in the UCL closely tracks the broad language that Congress embodied  in the  Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. Â§ 41 et seq.)  to reach business practices that were not specifically forbidden by  the common law or other statutes. (See  15 U.S.C. Â§ 45(a)  [?œUnfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair  or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce??are declared unlawful]; see generally Baker & Baum,  Section 5 of the  Federal Trade Commission Act: A Continuing Process of Redefinition  (1962) 7 Vill. L.Rev. 517, 525??42.) California decisions  have long recognized the close relationship between the language of the UCL and the Federal Trade Commission Act. (See,  e.g.,  People ex rel. Mosk v. National Research Co. (1962) 201 Cal.App.2d 765, 772??73 [20 Cal. Rptr. 516] .)

742,"244 [31 L.Ed.2d 170, 92 S.Ct. 898] , concluded that ?œlegislative and judicial authorities alike convince us that the Federal Trade  Commission does not arrogate excessive power to itself if, in measuring a practice against the elusive, but congressionally  mandated standard of fairness, it,  like a court of equity , considers public values beyond simply those enshrined in the letter or  encompassed in the spirit of antitrust laws.??(Italics added.) See  People v. Casa Blanca Convalescent Homes, Inc. (1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 509, 530 [206 Cal.

Superior Court (1996)  45 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1104 [53 Cal.

743,One line of Court of Appeal decisions has held that a balancing test", which the  Cel-Tech  court declined to adopt in the  competitor context (see  Cel-Tech, supra, 20 Cal.4th at pp. 184??85 ), should nonetheless be applied in the consumer context,  under which the determination whether a business practice is unfair to consumers ?œâ€˜â€œinvolves an examination of [that practice's]  impact on its alleged victim, balanced against the reasons, justifications and motives of the alleged wrongdoer.

A second line of Court of Appeal decisions has adopted what has been termed a ?œtethering test,??requiring that ?œthe public policy  which is a predicate to [a consumer unfair competition action under the ?œunfair??prong of the UCL] must be ?˜tethered??to specific  constitutional, statutory or regulatory provisions??in a manner similar to which  Cel-Tech  requires a competitor's cause of action to  be tethered to the antitrust laws. ( Gregory v. Albertson's, Inc. (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 845, 854 [128 Cal. Rptr. 2d 389] ; see, e.g.,  Scripps Clinic v. Superior Court (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 917, 940 [134 Cal. Rptr. 2d 101] .) A third line of Court of Appeal cases has adopted the three-part definition of unfairness applied under section 5 of the FTC Act  since 1980, namely that: ??1) The consumer injury must be substantial; (2) the injury must not be outweighed by any  countervailing benefits to consumers or competition; and (3) it must be an injury that consumers themselves could not  reasonably have avoided.??( Camacho v. Automobile Club of Southern California (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1394, 1403 [48 Cal.  Rptr. 3d 770] ; see, e.g.,  Rubenstein v. The Gap, Inc. (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 870, 880 [222 Cal. Rptr. 3d 397] .) This test has  sometimes been termed the ??section 5  test.??,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
744,"The FAL traces its origin to the 1915 version of former  section 654a of the Penal Code  (Stats. 1915, ch. 634, Â§ 1, pp. 1252??1253), which, in turn, was based upon a model false advertising statute that was first proposed in 1911 in  Printer's Ink  magazine,  an advertising journal. (See Note,  The Regulation of Advertising  (1956) 56 Colum. L.Rev. 1018, 1058; Note,  Enforcing  California's False Advertising Law: A Guide to Adjudication  (1974) 25 Hastings L.J. 1105, 1106.) The 1911 model statute  proposed to make it a misdemeanor to publish an advertisement containing ?œâ€˜any assertion, representation or statement of fact  which is untrue, deceptive or misleading?™â€?and was quite stringent, omitting any requirement that the advertiser be shown to have  intended to deceive or to know the improper character of the advertisement. (Note,  The Regulation of Advertising, supra , 56  Colum. L.Rev. at pp. 1058??059 & fn. 245.) In adopting the statute in California in 1915, however, the Legislature added a  scienter requirement, requiring a showing that the advertiser knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of  the false, deceptive or misleading character of the advertisement.

749,"At oral argument, counsel for Nationwide suggested that in federal court juries often decide such questions in actions under  the FTC Act in which civil penalties are sought. Under the FTC Act, however, civil penalties may be sought only for a defendant's  violation of a prior cease and desist order ( 15 U.S.C. Â§ 45(l) ,  (m)(1)(B) ) or for a defendant's knowing violation of a specific trade  regulation rule ( 15 U.S.C. Â§ 45(m)(1)(A) ). Although federal courts have held that there is a right to a jury trial in such actions, the  jury in such actions does not determine whether the practice is unfair or deceptive within the meaning of the  FTC Act , but rather  determines only whether the defendant violated the existing cease and desist order or the specific trade regulation rule. (See,  e.g.,  U.S. v. J.B. Williams Co. (2d Cir. 1974) 498 F.2d 414, 421??30 ;  U.S. v. Dish Network, LLC (C.D.Ill. 2010) 754 F.Supp.2d  1002, 1003??004 ; see also  15 U.S.C. Â§ 45(m)(2)  [providing that when the cease and desist order was not issued against the  particular defendant from whom civil penalties are sought, upon request ??the court  shall ??review the determination of law made  by the Commission ??that the act or practice which was the subject of such proceeding constituted an unfair or deceptive act or  practice in violation of  subsection (a) ??(italics added)].)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
751,"In  Raedeke  itself, the court, after confirming the existence and validity of the ?œequity first preference,??held that a plaintiff who  brings an action presenting both legal and equitable issues can avoid the potential loss of a jury trial on common issues by  electing to forgo the equitable claim and thus removing the equitable issues from the case. (See  Raedeke, supra, 10 Cal.3d at  pp. 671??72 .)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
752,"Contrary to the implication of the Court of Appeal decision below (see  Nationwide Biweekly, supra, 24 Cal.App.5th at p. 456 ),  this court's recent decision in  Shaw, supra, 2 Cal.5th 983  did not purport to abrogate or change this state's well-established  ?œequity first preference??doctrine. In  Shaw , we interpreted one provision of the statute before the court??Health and Safety Code  section 1278.5, subdivision (m) , which provided that nothing in the new legislation ?œabrogate[s] or limit[s] any other theory of  liability or remedy otherwise available at law?â€”as preserving in full a plaintiff's complementary cause of action under  Tameny v.  Atlantic Richfield Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 167 [164 Cal. Rptr. 839, 610 P.2d 1330] , including the plaintiff's right to obtain a jury  resolution of the  Tameny  claim. ( Shaw, supra, 2 Cal.5th at p. 1006 .)  Shaw  did not purport to overrule or disapprove the  numerous California decisions cited above that have applied the ?œequity first preference??doctrine for more than a century. Because in this case the equitable and legal aspects of the UCL and FAL actions are nonseverable and because Nationwide  has not questioned the continued vitality of the ?œequity first preference??doctrine, we have no occasion to consider whether there  is any reason to reevaluate this doctrine or to determine its proper application in a particular context.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
753,"The legislation was adopted by the voters at the November 4, 1986 General Election. The Legislature has amended relevant  provisions of the act on numerous occasions since its inception.

755,In his seminal article on the right to civil jury trial", Professor Fleming James observed that, at common law, when a plaintiff  was seeking to obtain both injunctive relief and civil penalties for a defendant's alleged statutory violation, the plaintiff would  have been required to bring two separate actions?”one in equity and one in law. As Professor James explained: ?œB's violation of  A's statutory right ??might entitle A to an injunction, to compensatory damages, and to a penalty. The right to any relief would  turn on whether B violated the statute. A might get a determination of that issue without a jury in an equity suit, seeking an  injunction and perhaps compensatory damages as incidental to an injunction. Or he might get such determination in an action at  law for damages or for the penalty. Since equity refused to enforce a penalty and the law would not give an injunction, two suits  would be required for complete relief. A had the choice which to bring first. And the first determination of the common issue  (violation  vel non ) would bind the parties in the second action. The plaintiff then had the power to choose the mode of trial of the  common issue, and he could so exercise it as to leave no room for judicial discretion.??(James,"  Right to a Jury Trial in Civil""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
756,"Actions  (1963) 72 Yale L.J. 655, 671??72, fns. omitted.) Thus, as a general matter, at common law when a plaintiff sought both  injunctive relief and civil penalties based upon a business's alleged violation of a statute, the business was by no means  guaranteed that the question whether it violated the statute would be determined by a jury rather than by a court.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
758,"In concluding that the gist of the causes of action created by the UCL and the FAL is equitable even when civil penalties as  well as injunctive relief are sought, we have relied on the specific attributes of the California UCL and FAL statutes, as well as  the established understanding of the scope of the California constitutional jury trial provision. Every other state has adopted consumer protection legislation somewhat comparable to the UCL and the FAL. (See, e.g., Stern,  Cal. Practice Guide:  Bus. & Prof. Code Â§ 17200  Practice,  supra , Â¶Â¶ 2:54-2:62, pp. 2-22 to 2-24; Nat. Consumer Law Center,  Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices (9th ed. 2016) Â§ 1.1., p. 1.) Although the numerous unfair or deceptive practice statutes  in other jurisdictions differ from the California statutes in a variety of respects, we note that a substantial majority of other state  courts that have addressed the question whether there is a right to a jury trial in civil actions brought under those states' unfair or  deceptive practice laws have concluded that there is no right to a jury trial in such actions. (See  Nunley v. State (Ala. 1993) 628  So.2d 619, 621??22 ;  People v. Shifrin (2014) 2014 COA 14 [342 P.3d 506, 512??13] ;  Associated Investment Co. Limited  Partnership v.

Several states  have reached a contrary conclusion, but none of those cases involved a statute that created a cause of action in which both  injunctive relief as well as damages or civil penalties could be obtained. (See  Robinson v. McDougal (1988) 62 Ohio App.3d 253  [575 N.E.2d 469, 474] ;  State v. Credit Bureau of Loredo, Inc. (Tex. 1975) 530 S.W.2d 288, 290??92 ;  State v.

759,"Although the court in  Tull  held that the  Seventh Amendment  granted the developer a right to a jury trial on the issue of  liability ,  the majority went on to hold that the  Seventh Amendment  did not require a jury trial on  the amount of civil penalties . The majority  explained that because ?œhighly discretionary calculations that take into account multiple factors are necessary in order to set civil  penalties under the Clean Water Act??and ?œ[t]hese are the kinds of calculations traditionally performed by judges,???œthe  Seventh  Amendment  does not require a jury trial for that purpose in a civil action.??( Tull, supra, 481 U.S. at p. 427 .) Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Stevens, dissented from the latter holding, objecting that by fashioning a civil action in which  liability but not the amount of damages is to be decided by a jury, ?œthe Court creates a form of civil adjudication I have never  encountered.??( Tull, supra, 481 U.S. at p. 428  (dis. opn. of Scalia, J.).)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
760,"We note that since the decision in  Tull , a number of state courts, in interpreting and applying their own state constitutional civil  jury trial provisions, have concluded, unlike the  Tull  decision, that there is no right to a jury trial in statutory causes of action  authorizing both injunctive relief and civil penalties. (See, e.g.,  State ex rel. Darwin v. Arnett (2014) 235 Ariz. 239 [330 P.3d 996,  1002] ;  Commissioner of Environmental Protection v. Connecticut Building Wrecking Co.

A few states that have  traditionally looked to the  Seventh Amendment  in interpreting their own state jury trial provision have followed  Tull . (See, e.g.,  Dept. of Revenue v.

761,"California is by no means alone in employing a holistic, qualitative standard for determining whether an action involving both  legal and equitable aspects should be characterized as legal or equitable for purposes of an applicable constitutional jury trial  provision.

762,"Concur In its answer brief filed in this court, Nationwide maintains that if this court rejects its state constitutional claim, we should  address the question whether it has a right to a jury trial under the  Sixth  or  Seventh Amendment to the United States  Constitution  and should hold, notwithstanding the absence of federal decisional support, that it has a right to jury trial in a state  court action under those federal provisions. The Court of Appeal did not address these issues, neither the petition for review nor  any answer to the petition raised these issues, and thus we decline to address those issues. (See  Cal. Rules of Court, rule  8.516(b)(1) .)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
763,"Despite what the term ?œgist??might otherwise call to mind, the aim of this inquiry is not to identify a single essential element at  the action's theoretical core. We instead try to understand how the statutory cause of action, considered as a whole, relates to  the historical division between law and equity, the goal being to place the cause of action appropriately among its possible  historical analogues. I do not believe federal law differs a great deal on this basic point. Though the majority reads  Tull  as establishing a strict rule that  the plea for a legal remedy carries a jury trial right notwithstanding any other substantial equitable characteristics the action  might have (maj. opn.,  ante , at pp. 330??31), I do not read  Tull  this way. The high court's case law has long made clear that the  federal jury trial inquiry turns on a holistic examination of both ?œthe nature of the action and of the remedy sought?â€”a rule  Tull   cited without signaling any intent to depart from it. ( Tull, supra, 481 U.S. at p. 417 ; see also  id. at p. 422, fn. 6  [?œOur search is for  a single historical analog, taking into consideration the nature of the cause of action and the remedy as two important factors.?];  accord, e.g.,  Feltner v. Columbia Pictures Television, Inc. (1998) 523 U.S. 340, 348 [140 L.Ed.2d 438, 118 S.Ct. 1279]  [ 7th  Amend. to the U.S. Const . intended to apply to actions ?œâ€˜in which legal  rights  were to be ascertained and determined?™â€?(italics  omitted & added)].) In any event,  Tull  is distinguishable from this case on other, more case-specific grounds, which I discuss later in this opinion. We  need not rely here on any broad generalizations about how, if at all, the federal approach to the civil jury right differs from  California's.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
764,"The majority discusses the equitable character of the UCL and the FAL in detail only in part III of the opinion, which addresses  statutory  jury trial rights. The majority concludes there that in enacting and amending both statutes, ?œthe legislative history and  legislative purpose of both statutes convincingly establish that the Legislature intended that such causes of action under these  statutes would be tried by the court, exercising the traditional flexible discretion and judicial expertise of a court of equity ??.?? (Maj. opn.,  ante , at p. 297.) In its constitutional analysis, the majority simply cross-references this discussion. ( Id.  at p. 326.)  Readers should not be confused, however, by this organizational choice: The Legislature's intent does not control whether there  is a constitutional right to jury trial. (See  id.  at p. 314.) Business and Professions Code section 17500  defines the scope of false advertising liability: ?œIt is unlawful for any person ?? with intent directly or indirectly to dispose of real or personal property or to perform services ??to make or disseminate or cause  to be made or disseminated before the public ??any statement, concerning that real or personal property or those services ?? which is untrue or misleading, and which is known, or which by the exercise of reasonable care should be known, to be untrue or  misleading, or for any person ??to so make ??any such statement as part of a plan or scheme with the intent not to sell that  personal property or those services, professional or otherwise, so advertised at the price stated therein, or as so advertised.??
766,The FTC Guides on testimonials and endorsements", for example, simply ?œprovide the basis for voluntary compliance with the  law by advertisers and endorsers.??( 16 C.F.R. Â§ 255.0(a) (2020) ; see also  id. ,  Â§ 260.1(a) (2019)  [Guides on environmental claims  ?œhelp marketers avoid making environmental marketing claims that are unfair or deceptive,??but ?œdo not operate to bind the FTC  or the public.?];  FTC v. Mary Carter Paint Co. (1965) 382 U.S. 46, 47??8 [15 L.Ed.2d 128, 86 S.Ct. 219]  [?œThese, of course, were  guides, not fixed rules as such, and were designed to inform businessmen of the factors which would guide Commission  decision.?].) And while the Stern treatise describes some of the FTC Guides as potentially relevant to FAL liability, it gives no  examples of their use by courts for this purpose and does not describe such use as common. (See Stern, Cal. Practice Guide:  Bus. & Prof. Code Â§ 17200  Practice,  supra , Â¶Â¶ 4:46, 4:72, 4:80.2??:80.4, pp. 4-14, 4-32.) The same is true of the cited federal decisions upholding FTC findings of deceptiveness (maj. opn.,  ante , at p. 313), such as  FTC v. Colgate-Palmolive Co.

Fidelity tries to distinguish  State Fund  on the ground that the article prescribing the scope of immunity for  Insurance Code  section 11758  differs from the underlying articles determining the scope of immunity under  section 12414.26 . While that may be,  the relevance of  State Fund  does not depend on any substantive similarity in what it is those underlying articles authorize, but  rather on the point that each statute extends immunity only to what is authorized?”whatever that may be?”and not to acts that  are related to, but unauthorized by, the underlying article.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
816,"The McBride-Grunsky Act was designed only to ?œenact[] the minimal regulation required to exempt California insurance from  federal  antitrust law .??( King v.

The law made California ?œa so-called ?˜open rate??state,??with rates ?œset by insurers without prior or subsequent approval by  the ??Commissioner.??( Id. at p. 1221  (maj. opn.).) Indeed, the act prohibited the Commissioner from fixing rates, relying instead  on the open market to dictate rates. (See Ins.

McCarthy, California Land Title  Association, letter to Governor Ronald Reagan re Senate Bill No. 1293 (1973??974 Reg. Sess.) September 17, 1973, pages 1,  3, 5. As originally introduced, the legislation extended immunity to acts authorized under the title insurance chapter. (Sen. Bill No.  1293 (1973??974 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 27, 1973, Â§ 15.) Shortly before final passage, the provision was amended to  narrow immunity to only those acts authorized by specific articles: ?œNo act done, action taken, or agreement made pursuant to  the authority conferred by Article 5.5 (commencing with  Section 12401 ) or Article 5.7 (commencing with  Section 12402 ) of this  chapter shall constitute a violation of or grounds for prosecution or civil proceedings under any other law of this state heretofore  or hereafter enacted which does not specifically refer to insurance.??(Sen. Bill No. 1293 (1973??974 Reg. Sess.) as amended  Sept. 10, 1973, Â§ 15.) As noted above ( ante , p. 114), in 1988, voters passed Proposition 103, an initiative that discarded much of the original McBride- Grunsky Act and replaced it with a drastically revised insurance rate regulation scheme. (See generally  20th Century Ins. Co. v.  Garamendi, supra, 8 Cal.4th at pp. 239??46 ;  Calfarm Ins. Co. v. Deukmejian (1989) 48 Cal.3d 805, 812??13 [258 Cal. Rptr.  161, 771 P.2d 1247] ;  MacKay v. Superior Court, supra, 188 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1445??446 .) But the McBride-Grunsky Act's  exemption for title insurance was left in place (see  Ins. Code, Â§Â§ 1851, subd. (d) ,  1861.13 ;  Calfarm Ins. Co., at p. 812, fn. 1 ), and  so these reforms did not alter the framework for title insurance rate regulation, which remains subject to the McBride-Grunsky- Act-style rules specific to title insurance adopted in 1973.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
818,"Concerning the parallel language in a sister statute, the Court of Appeal has observed: ?œ[W]hile the initial motivation behind  Insurance Code section 1860.1  may have been exemption from antitrust laws in particular, it was recognized [at the time of  enactment] that the language of the exemption was, in fact, broader.??( MacKay v. Superior Court, supra, 188 Cal.App.4th at p.  1445 .) Neither Villanueva nor the Commissioner addresses whether the language of  section 12414.26  sweeps more broadly  than concerted action, and we do not attempt to resolve the issue here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
820,"HN15 [ ]  CA(15) [ ]  (15)  When primary jurisdiction applies, an initial suit in court is permitted, although the trial court may  thereafter choose to stay the action and solicit an agency's views. ( Jonathan Neil & Assoc., Inc. v. Jones (2004) 33 Cal.4th 917,  931??33 [16 Cal. Rptr. 3d 849, 94 P.3d 1055] ;  Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 377, 390??92 [6 Cal.  Rptr. 2d 487, 826 P.2d 730] .) When exhaustion applies, a party must pursue an administrative remedy initially, but may  thereafter file suit in court. ( Jonathan Neil, at pp. 930??31 ;  Farmers Ins. Exchange, at p. 390 .) When a statutory regime vests  exclusive jurisdiction in an agency, in contrast, a party may only proceed administratively and thereafter may only challenge the  results of any administrative outcome through administrative mandamus ( Code Civ. Proc., Â§ 1094.5 ) or such other means as the  statutory scheme may specify (see, e.g.,  Lab. Code, Â§ 1700.44, subd. (a)  [exclusive jurisdiction vested in the Labor  Commissioner, with review by way of trial de novo in superior court]).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
821,"Fidelity further notes that other parts of the statutory scheme give the Commissioner additional responsibilities for interpreting  and enforcing the rate-filing requirements of the title insurance chapter. For example,  Insurance Code section 12340.7  gives the  Commissioner the authority to promulgate regulations identifying certain ?œmiscellaneous charges??that are not subject to  regulation as rates. But nothing about this grant of rulemaking authority implies exclusive jurisdiction over consumer claims  based on failure to comply with the relevant provisions of the title insurance law.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

823,"Fidelity urges that in  section 12414.29 , ?œâ€˜[n]o other law relating to insurance????means no other law,??and if ?œthe Legislature  meant to limit  section 12414.29  to other provisions in the Insurance Code, it could easily and clearly have said so.??But the  Legislature  did  clearly say so, in the very language Fidelity quotes: ?œno other law  relating to insurance ??( Â§ 12414.29 , italics  added), i.e., no other insurance-specific law. When the Legislature intended to reference laws of general application from outside  the Insurance Code, it used quite different language, as in  sections 1860.1  and  12414.26  (?œany other law ??which does not  specifically refer to insurance??.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
