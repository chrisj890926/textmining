22,1," On October 11, 1990, I granted defendants' motion for, summary judgment against plaintiffs' fraud claims.  Jose v. M/V FIR 
GROVE, 765 F. Supp. 1024 (D. Or. 1990). Thus, this claim is included solely to preserve the issue in the event of an appeal."
22,2," On June 24, 1991, I granted plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a fifth amended complaint to add two additional defendants and 
the allegations under RICO. "
23,3," On February 8, 1991, I held that U.S. law would not apply to the Joses' personal injury claims under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. § 
688, or general maritime law.  Accordingly, these claims are included within my discussion of the dismissal of plaintiffs' ""pendent"" 
claims under the forum non conveniens doctrine."
23,4," Newly added defendants include Western Shipping Agency, Inc., a Philippine corporation, and Yeh Shipping Co., Ltd., a Hong 
Kong corporation. "
24,5," Again, I have previously set forth the factors I must consider in a forum non conveniens inquiry in Jose, 765 F. Supp. 1037, as 
well as the related case of Su v. M/V SOUTHERN ASTER, 767 F. Supp. 205 (filed 1990).  They are repeated here for the 
convenience of the parties. "
25,6," Had this dispute arisen under Oregon law, I would have the option of certifying the question as one of ""first impression"" to the 
Oregon Supreme Court under O.R.S. 28.200, et. seq.  Alternatively, I could have declined to exercise pendent jurisdiction over 
this claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(1)(2) on the basis that the claim involves an unsettled issue of state law.  However, 
because this case involves disputed issues of the laws of another nation, I have none of these options available to me."
25,7," As noted in my previous opinions, the alleged misrepresentations which form the basis of plaintiffs' wage and fraud claims took 
place in Manilla, where they were recruited, and in Japan, where they joined the ship and were given copies of the ITF Collective 
Agreement.  Plaintiffs received 20% of their wages on a monthly basis on board the ship wherever the ship was located which 
would include the high seas, Japan, and U.S. waters.  The remaining 80% were paid on a monthly basis to plaintiffs' designated 
representatives in the Philippines. "
26,8," In Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of America, 749 F.2d 1378, 1384 (9th Cir. 1984) cert. denied, 472 U.S. 1032, 87 L. Ed. 2d 
643, 105 S. Ct. 3514 (1985) (Timberlane II), the court declined to apply U.S. antitrust law to a case filed by Oregon plaintiffs 
against an American Bank and two Honduran corporations on the basis that enforcement would lead to a ""significant conflict with 
Honduran law and policy."" "
27,9," As with the issue of forum non conveniens, defendants' latter motion also raises a basic issue that has persisted throughout the 
course of the litigation of this and other parallel proceedings -- that of the reach of U.S. laws to foreign parties in what is 
essentially a foreign labor dispute.  However, unlike the U.S. Shipping Act, 46 U.S.C. § 10313, which expressly proves that it is 
to apply to seamen aboard foreign vessels, the federal RICO statute contains no such guidance as to its extraterritorial reach. "
28,10," In Marcos, the Ninth Circuit found that the allegations that the defendants had smuggled stolen property into the U.S. and 
converted it into U.S. holdings was sufficient to satisfy subject matter jurisdiction. Thus, the court did not reach the issue of the 
extraterritorial application of RICO to foreign defendants who commit acts outside of the territorial boundaries of the U.S."
28,11," In light of its conclusion, the court found that it need not reach the issue of whether defendants had a constitutionally 
significant relationship with the district of Florida which would permit the exercise of personal jurisdiction.  Id., 906 F.2d at 1523."
28,12," Although I need not reach the issue of whether service of process is available aginst foreign defendants under section 1965, I 
find Judge Aldisert's reasoning helpful to the statutory interpretation of RICO's extraterritorial reach and more consistent with the 
Supreme Court's recent analysis in EEOC since he applies the presumption against extraterritoriality.  In addition, I find his 
emphasis on weighing U.S. interest against that of Great Britain helpful in that he utilizes factors similar to those identified by the 
Ninth Circuit in Timberlane I. "
29,13," I note that the second factor identified in Timberlane I regarding plaintiff's heightened burden to show a restraint on trade, is 
inapplicable outside of the antitrust context."
29,14," Because plaintiffs seek only monetary damages for past conduct, the extent to which enforcement by either state can be 
expected to achieve compliance is inapplicable to this case."
29,15," Section 1964(c) provides for civil enforcement of the RICO chapter by any person ""injured in his business or property by 
reason of a violation of section 1962."" "
35,1," In the Common Pleas Court action, Federal Packaging stood as the plaintiff and Mallitz as the defendant. Kardon Industries 
and its principals, Bruce, Leroy and Robert Kardon, were not involved in that action, nor are those persons now attempting to 
enforce the non-competition agreement against Mallitz. Kardon Industries and the Kardons have, presumably, been named as 
Defendants in this action because of Mallitz' claim that the Kardons violated ERISA by forcing him to sign the non-competition 
agreement. "
37,2," It may, in fact, be more accurate to say that Mallitz seeks a preliminary injunction to reverse the status quo pending a decision 
on the merits, since Mallitz asks this Court, in effect, to undo the temporary injunction issued by the Common Pleas Court. "
38,3," If a statute represents an exception to the Anti-Injunction Act, a federal court may, in its discretion, stay parallel proceedings in 
a state court. If a statute is not an exception to the Anti-Injunction Act, a federal court may still stay proceedings in state court if 
necessary in aid of its jurisdiction or to protect or effectuate its judgments. As explained below, this Court finds no need to stay 
proceedings in the Common Pleas Court in aid of this Court's jurisdiction or to effectuate its judgments. "
39,4," Subsection (a)(1)(B) provides that HN8[
] ""[a] civil action may be brought by a participant or beneficiary to recover benefits 
due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits 
under the terms of the plan."" "
41,5," Federal Packaging, of course, is neither Mallitz' employer nor a fiduciary of Kardon Industries' profit sharing plan. It is unlikely 
that Federal Packaging could have violated ERISA, and no such allegation is made to that effect. The violation of ERISA, if any, 
was committed by the Kardons. Accordingly, if this Court were to issue an injunction, Federal Packaging would be penalized for 
acts over which it had no control. "
45,*," Daniel M. Friedman, of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation. "
60,1," This complex case was stayed for several years at the request of the parties while they explored various ways to settle this 
litigation."
60,2," EDCs are electric utility distribution systems owned by cooperative corporations engaged in the distribution of power to retail 
customers. Some EDCs own small electric generating facilities and transmission lines. Others own no generation or 
transmission facilities and receive all of their power supply from purchases at wholesale."
60,3," NCEMC is a cooperative corporation organized under the laws of North Carolina for the purpose of carrying out the wholesale 
power supply ventures of the EDCs in North Carolina. These functions include acting as a bargaining agent for the EDCs in 
negotiations with other utilities concerning wholesale power purchases and conducting studies to determine whether it can 
feasibly construct an electric generation and transmission system which would satisfy the wholesale power needs of the EDCs. 
NCEMC and its predecessor organization has been in existence since 1949."
60,4, All the Plaintiff EDCs are members of NCEMC except for French Broad EDC. 
61,5," By January 1, 1976, twenty (20) months before the Plaintiffs filed their complaint, CP&L controlled over eighty-five per cent 
(85%) of the generating capacity in eastern North Carolina and over eighty-five per cent (85%) of the transmission lines in 
eastern North Carolina."
61,6," Power exchange services are the various types of services available from coordinating utilities necessary to develop a G&T 
system. Such services include emergency or maintenance power and energy under a plan of reserve sharing, power and energy 
from a specific unit under a plan of coordinated development, short-term or limited term power used to satisfy needs resulting 
from a long-term deficiency in capacity, wheeling services, opportunities for investment in joint generation or transmission 
facilities, and energy incident to a planned hydro-thermal coordination."
61,7," The parties cannot agree on whether the sixteen EDCs are suing as potential excluded competitors from the G&T business or 
as captive customers of CP&L. Much of the confusion stems from conflicting representations made in the Plaintiffs' responses to 
CP&Ls summary judgment motions. Compare Plaintiffs' Response Opposing Untimely Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on 
Grounds of Standing, at 2-4 (Apr. 7, 1986) (asserting that the sixteen EDCs are suing as customers in a market in which trade 
has been restrained) with Plaintiffs Response Opposing Summary Judgment on Grounds of Claimed Immunity from the Antitrust 
Laws, at 78, 85 (Mar. 12, 1986) (asserting that all the Plaintiffs are suing as potential competitors in the G&T business, as well 
as customers of CP&L, and that all of the Plaintiffs' damages stem from their potential capacity as competitors). Furthermore, it 
is unclear from the papers of the parties whether NCEMC is anything more than an extension of the Plaintiff EDCs or whether it 
is an independent corporation. What is clear is that, regardless of whether the sixteen EDCs are suing as customers or potential 
competitors of CP&L, their rights are no greater and no less than NCEMC's because all the damage in this case comes from the 
alleged exclusion of NCEMC from the G&T business. As the Plaintiffs concisely put it, ""what this case is really about . . . is the 
Defendant's continuing frustration of the efforts of Plaintiff NCEMC to enter the generation and transmission business."" Plaintiffs 
Response Opposing Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment under the Statute of Limitations, at 5-6 (Jan. 14, 1986). With 
that in mind, the court will examine the Plaintiffs' claims from the perspective that the fortunes of the sixteen EDCs will rise or fall 
with those of NCEMC. It is undisputed that NCEMC is suing as a potential, but so far excluded, competitor of CP&L in the G&T 
business."
61,8," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides in pertinent part that ""every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or 
conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal."" 
15 U.S.C. § 1 (1988). In order to prevail on its Section 1 claim, the Plaintiffs must prove that CP&L's concerted action with other 
utilities was an unreasonable restraint of trade. See Continental T.V. v. GTE Sylvania, 433 U.S. 36, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 
2549 (1977). In so doing, the plaintiff must show ""(1) that the conspiracy produced adverse, anticompetitive effects within the 
relevant product and geographic market; (2) that the objects of and conduct pursuant to the conspiracy were illegal; and (3) that 
the plaintiff was injured as a proximate result of the conspiracy."" Terry's Floor Fashions v. Burlington Indus., 763 F.2d 604, 610 
n.10 (4th Cir. 1985) (citation omitted)."
61,9," Section 2 of the Sherman Act provides in pertinent part that ""every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or 
combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several 
states, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony."" 15 U.S.C. § 2 (1988). To prevail on a monopolization claim a 
plaintiff must show possession of monopoly power in a relevant market, willful acquisition or maintenance of that power in an "
62,," exclusionary manner, and antitrust injury. See United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-71, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778, 86 S. Ct. 
1698 (1966)."
62,10, The REA was created by Congress to aid efforts to fully electrify rural areas of the country.
62,11," Wheeling power is an arrangement in which one utility uses the surplus transmission facilities of another utility to obtain 
electricity from a source not directly connected to the system of the former."
62,12," Santee-Cooper was a hydroelectric generating unit developed to provide power to rural EDCs. It was built by the South 
Carolina Public Service Authority and began producing electricity in 1942."
62,13," A ""mill"" is one-tenth (1/10) of a cent; ""kw"" is shorthand for kilowatt, a measure of power or electrical capacity available to a 
user; and ""kwh"" is shorthand for kilowatt-hour, a measure of energy supplied to the user."
62,14," The main goal of the REA was to electrify rural areas, not to enable small EDCs to compete for G&T business. Consistent with 
its mission, the REA would never approve a loan to build a G&T system that would produce more expensive power than an EDC 
could obtain from a large utility. "
63,15," Long-run incremental cost ""measures all the costs of adding a new product or service--'fixed' as well as variable costs (and 
'capital' as well as 'operating' items). Essentially, the LRIC approach assumes that all costs become variable in the long run."" 
MCI Communications Corp. v. AT&T Co., 708 F.2d 1081, 1115 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 891, 78 L. Ed. 2d 226, 104 S. 
Ct. 234 (1983) (footnote omitted)."
63,16," Wein argues that market factors in the utility industry such as high barriers to entry due to huge capital costs and inefficient 
state and federal regulation made a predatory scheme by CP&L plausible."
63,17," The Lumberton Power Plant was CP&L's newest and most expensive. The cost of power from this plant was well above the 
7.5 mills per kwh rate CP&L charged the rural EDCs for electricity."
63,18," In 1950, Virginia Electric & Power Company decreased its rate to the EDCs to 7.5 mills per kwh and Tide Water Power 
Company decreased its rate to 8.5 mills per kwh."
63,19," First, they point to CP&L's opposition during the 1950's to the financing and construction of a regional bulk electricity 
transmission network which would serve the Southeast, be coordinated by the Southeastern Power Administration, and lessen 
the EDCs' dependence upon CP&L for power. Second, they allege that CP&L along with other dominant regional utilities formed 
a Carolinas-Virginia pool (""CARVA"") in 1961 as a tool to tighten their monopolistic control over the G&T business. CARVA "
64,," allowed its members to pool and coordinate their electric resources for greater efficiency. The Plaintiffs argue that CP&L 
prevented the EDCs from joining CARVA and, thereby, precluded them from obtaining similar advantages. Third, they mention 
that in 1964 a bill mandating coordination--joint planning arrangements between utilities for the development of transmission to 
take advantage of economies of scale--was defeated in Congress after heavy lobbying by dominant regional utilities like CP&L. 
Fourth, they note that CP&L refused to negotiate with them over the joint ownership of G&T systems throughout the 1960's even 
though other large utilities were negotiating in good faith. Fifth, they allege that the purpose of the Southeastern Reliability 
Council, formed in 1969 by CP&L and South Carolina Electric & Gas Company, was to prevent the rural EDCs from receiving 
the benefits of regional coordination in the power exchange market. Sixth, they point to CP&Ls opposition to the Yankee-Dixie 
bill in Congress--a proposal to coordinate G&T systems among municipal and rural electric utilities in twenty-one (21) states, 
including North Carolina."
64,20," They cite CP&Ls refusal in 1976 to help the EDCs obtain power from Georgia Power Company's Vogtle Nuclear Power Plant; 
CP&Ls refusal during 1974 and 1975 to sell the EDCs joint ownership in the Brunswick and Harris Nuclear Power Plants; CP&Ls 
opposition from 1968-74 to Electric Power in the Carolinas--an aborted statewide power project which would have joined all 
North Carolina municipalities owning electric systems with the EDCs; CP&L's rate increases from 1971 to the present and the 
pancaking of new rate increases on top of previous, unapproved rate increases; various delivery point disputes between CP&L 
and the Plaintiff EDCs such as restricting the EDCs to low-voltage delivery points, placing maximum restrictions on delivery and, 
when loads grew, unreasonably requiring the EDCs to invest in transmission facilities, and limiting the amount of electric 
capacity available at a particular delivery point; and CP&L's acquisition of other electric systems like Domestic Electric Service in 
1978 and the distribution system of the Village of Pinehurst, North Carolina, in 1981, which tightened their monopolistic control 
over wholesale power supply in eastern North Carolina."
64,21," In this case, some of CP&L's alleged anticompetitive acts took place prior to the statute of limitations cut-off date of August 17, 
1973, and other acts took place after that date. The law in situations like this is: Where defendants are alleged to have committed acts injurious to a plaintiff pursuant to an unlawful conspiracy, and where 
defendants committed some such acts more than four years before plaintiff commenced suit, and other such acts less than four 
years before plaintiff commenced suit, the plaintiff is allowed to recover damages resulting only from those acts committed less 
than four years before commencement of his suit. "
65,," Imperial Point Colonnades Condominium, Inc. v. Mangurian, 549 F.2d 1029, 1034 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 859, 98 S. 
Ct. 185, 54 L. Ed. 2d 132 (1977)."
65,22," The Plaintiffs allege CP&L engaged in various anticompetitive acts relating to power exchange services such as refusing to 
wheel power, opposing Santee-Cooper, opposing ventures of the Southeastern Power Administration, forming CARVA, refusing 
joint ownership of nuclear power plants, forming the Southeastern Reliability Counsel, and opposing the Yankee-Dixie project. "
66,23," Plaintiffs claim that only in 1976 did its own hypothetical system show a ""cumulative advantage"" over the rates it was paying 
Defendant. Plaintiffs' Response Opposing Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment under the Statute of Limitations, at 74 
(Jan. 14, 1986). Plaintiffs' damage study shows that from 1962 to 1966 and in 1968 the cost of power from Plaintiffs' hypothetical 
system would have been less overall than what they paid to CP&L. Plaintiffs' expert, however, discounts this damage as not 
robust, Affidavit of Harold H. Wein, at 21 (Jan. 13, 1986), and that the cumulative position was negative at that time. Id. at 17."
66,24," The plaintiff in Berkey stood in a multi-faceted relationship with Kodak. Berkey Photo, Inc., was a customer of Kodak in the 
film, color print paper, and photo-finishing equipment and supplies markets, and a competitor of Kodak in photo-finishing 
services and camera sales. Berkey sued Kodak under the Sherman Act alleging, in part, that it was paying excessive prices as a 
customer of Kodak and, as a result, Kodak gained an unfair advantage over Berkey as a competitor in the photo-finishing 
services market."
66,25," As noted supra note 7, even if the sixteen EDCs are properly classified as customers of CP&L, their rights are the same as 
NCEMC's because all the damage in this case comes from NCEMC's supposed exclusion from the G&T business. If the Plaintiff 
EDCs were suing as customers, their damage theory would be the difference between the inflated monopolistic price that CP&L 
is charging them for power and a competitive price. This is not their theory. In fact, the Plaintiff EDCs admit that they have 
already recovered overcharges in proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Instead, the Plaintiff EDCs 
are asking for the difference between what they paid CP&L for power and the cost of power from a hypothetical G&T plan which 
allegedly would have been built absent CP&Ls bad conduct. Therefore, if NCEMC has no claim against CP&L neither do the 
Plaintiff EDCs."
66,26," See Transcript of Hearing on Motions for Summary Judgment, at 16 (May 2, 1990) (counsel for Plaintiffs indicating that 
recoupment was not part of their theory). Plaintiffs rely on a theory of cross-subsidization, whereby Defendant suffered no losses 
by having other customers make up its deficiencies as it went. See infra pp. 33-38. "
67,27," The testimony was as follows: ""Q. But rather than go into a court and try to get a court order to stop CP&L, you chose to wait and get the benefit of the low rate 
until such time as CP&L decided to raise it? A. [Springs] I think that's right. I believe that's correct."" Deposition of David A. Springs at 483 (Sept. 23, 1985)."
67,28," See Deposition of David A. Springs at 473-74 (Sept. 23, 1985). The testimony was as follows: ""Q. . . . At that point in time [1970], was there any discussion between you or anyone else at Southern Engineering or with the 
plaintiffs about going to court to challenge CP&L for what you believed to be its improper conduct over the last 25 years on its 
low rate which you believe kept you out of the G&T business? A. [Springs] Well, that kind of discussion had been going on for a long period of time, but I don't know that that would -- that right 
there. We didn't know what was going to happen. I don't know that we we [sic] could have even -- you know, this is hindsight."""
67,29," Plaintiffs justify this in two ways. First, they argue that they did not pay monopoly prices--overcharges--until 1976 and under 
Berkey only then did their cause of action accrue. Plaintiffs' Response Opposing Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment 
under the Statute of Limitations, at 72-74. Second, Plaintiffs argue that only in 1976 ""is the trend heavily in favor of the 
hypothetical system."" Id. at 75. The court finds both of these reasons equally unpersuasive. "
68,30," The testimony was as follows: ""Q. And after these Type II damages the difference between CP&L's rate and the rate from that system could be calculated 
essentially at any time, you just pick your point? A. [Wein] Engineers can calculate these things at any time. The computations don't depend on anything. . . . . A. [Wein] . . . The computation of Southern could be made at any time.Q. You mean the computations in their damage studies? A. [Wein] Computations such as are in the damage studies.Q. Yes. A. [Wein] Yes, they could calculate Type I and Type II type damages. Insofar as their art is involved they could do that. Q. You agree with me that in looking at Wein Exhibit 3 [damage study by Southern Engineering], that in 1966 Southern 
Engineering could have done all the calculations shown on that exhibit up through 1966? A. [Wein] Yes, they could have done that. I agree. Q. And they would have shown these Type II damages in the years '62 through '66? A. [Wein] They could have shown Type II damages, yes."" Deposition of Harold H. Wein at 773-74, 785 (Sept. 9, 1985). In an affidavit supporting Plaintiffs' opposition to summary judgment Professor Wein seeks to explain his deposition testimony. 
He asserts that the ability of the engineers to make calculations or computations does not mean that they would have shown 
damages. Affidavit of Harold H. Wein, at 13 (Jan. 13, 1986) (contained in Exhibit 1 of Appendix to Plaintiffs' Response Opposing 
Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment under the Statute of Limitations). Professor Wein cannot seek to explain away his 
deposition testimony by use of affidavit. Cf. Rohrbough v. Wyeth Laboratories, Inc., 916 F.2d 970 (4th Cir. 1990); Miller v. FDIC, 
906 F.2d 972 (4th Cir. 1990). The court finds the deposition testimony to be more credible than the ex parte affidavit and, while 
considering the affidavit's explanation, will credit the deposition and Plaintiffs' own damage study. See supra note 23. See 
Rohrbough, 916 F.2d at 976; Barwick v. Celotex Corp., 736 F.2d 946, 960 (4th Cir. 1984)."
68,31," Even if NCEMC and the EDCs are classified as customers of CP&L instead of potential competitors, there still was fact of 
damage prior to August 17, 1973. Thus, as customers NCEMC and the EDCs were first injured by CP&L in 1962. "
69,32," Wein admitted at his deposition that Type I damages could have been calculated in the 1960's. Deposition of Harold H. Wein, 
at 772-73, 785-86 (Sept. 9, 1985) (contained in Exhibit 2 of Appendix to Defendant Carolina Power & Light Company's 
Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment under the Statute of Limitations). ""Q. Your Type I damages presently, which are the costs of building this system of plaintiffs, . . . I take it the assumption under 
those Type I damages is that plaintiffs, absent the violations of CP&L, would have built that system starting in 1954? A. [Wein] Yes. Q. Am I correct, then, that in 1954 you could have calculated Type I damages? A. [Wein] Well, sure, . . . I could have calculated what it costs to have build [sic] a plant in 1954, and gone through the same 
procedure as they did in March [1985]. Q. And I take it also in 1970 if you had brought the suit at that time, you would have calculated the Type I damages? A. [Wein] Yes. I think Southern would also be able to calculate the cost of building a plant or system of plants, . . . ."" Deposition of Harold H. Wein, at 772-73 (Sept. 9, 1985). "
70,," Professor Wein, in his affidavit, states that while such calculations could have been made they would not have shown non-
speculative damages. See supra note 30."
70,33," Most of these claims fit into Section 2 of the Sherman Act as examples of the unlawful maintenance of monopoly power. A few 
claims such as CP&Ls opposition--along with Duke Power Company, South Carolina Electric and Gas Company, and Virginia 
Electric and Power Company--to Electric Power in the Carolinas may fit into Section 1 of the Sherman Act as a conspiracy in 
restraint of trade."
70,34," The fact of damage question has no bearing on NCEMC's ability to obtain injunctive relief since ""threatened loss or damage"" 
as opposed to actual injury is all that is needed for the issuance of an injunction. 15 U.S.C. § 26; see Zenith, 395 U.S. at 130 
(injunctive relief available even though no actual injury suffered). "
71,35," See, e.g., Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142, 90 S. Ct. 1598 (1970); Langham-Hill Petroleum, 
Inc. v. Southern Fuels Co., 813 F.2d 1327, 1329 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 829, 98 L. Ed. 2d 60, 108 S. Ct. 99 (1987)."
71,36," The court notes that in 1955 the North Carolina Supreme Court found that the 7.5 mills per kwh rate ""was approved many 
years ago at the request of the Federal Government."" State v. Municipal Corps. of Scotland Neck, 243 N.C. 193, 200, 90 S.E.2d 
519, 526 (1955). "
72,37," N.C. Gen. Stat. § 62-130 (1989) provides that the mission of the North Carolina Utilities Commission is to ""make, fix, establish 
or allow just and reasonable rates for all public utilities subject to its jurisdiction."" Utility rates regulated by the Federal 
Government also must be just and reasonable. 16 U.S.C. § 824d(a)."
72,38," Cross-subsidization means that a company subsidizes losses on the sale of goods or services to a customer or in a market 
with excess profits gained from other customers or in other markets."
72,39," More recent cases recognize that cross-subsidization can be a viable recoupment strategy in some settings. See, e.g., 
California v. FCC, 905 F.2d 1217, 1233-38 (9th Cir. 1990) (significant risk of cross-subsidization from undetected cost-shifting by 
the Bell Operating Companies); United States v. Western Elec. Co., 283 App. D.C. 299, 900 F.2d 283, 297-300 (D.C. Cir. 1990) 
(cross-subsidization by the Bell Operating Companies recognized as a threat to consumer welfare). These cases almost all 
originate from the breakup of AT&T. Cross-subsidization was likely in this setting because AT&T was so large that its product-
line ""cost data are apparently impenetrable even to its own regulators,"" AT&T, 524 F. Supp. at 1370, and because it was easy 
for the Bell Operating Companies to shift costs from the unregulated portion of their business to the regulated portion of their 
business.  California, 905 F.2d at 1234. These concerns are not present in this case because CP&L's electricity business is 
totally regulated and there is no evidence suggesting CP&L is too large for effective regulatory oversight. Furthermore, cases 
from other regulated industries have rejected cross-subsidization out of hand. See, e.g., Lamoille Valley R.R. v. ICC, , 229 App. 
D.C. 17, 711 F.2d 295, 317 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (""the ICC's emphasis on [defendant] Canadian National's financial strength and 
neglect of the profitability of the Grand Trunk Eastern line ignores Canadian National's incentive to maximize profits by shedding 
money-losing operations. Nothing in the record supports the implausible proposition that Canadian National will indefinitely 
subsidize losses on its Grand Trunk Eastern line.""). Cross-subsidization has even been rejected in cases arising from the 
telephone industry. See MCI Communications Corp. v. AT&T, 708 F.2d 1081, 1123-24 (7th Cir. 1983); Northeastern Tel. Co. v. 
AT&T, 651 F.2d 76, 89 (2d Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 943, 71 L. Ed. 2d 654, 102 S. Ct. 1438 (1982)."
72,40," In AT&T, the government claimed that AT&T set its prices high in the MTS and WATS areas where it enjoyed a monopoly and 
low in private line areas where it faced competition.  AT&T, 524 F. Supp. at 1365. The district court further opined that 
recoupment through cross-subsidization is an especially attractive strategy for a regulated utility.  Id. at 1369."
72,41," In Matsushita, American television manufacturers claimed that Japanese television manufacturers illegally conspired to drive 
them out of the United States market by maintaining artificially high prices for televisions in Japan and, at the same time, 
maintaining below-cost prices for televisions exported to and sold in the United States. Id. at 577-78. The low American 
television prices were allegedly cross-subsidized by high television prices in Japan. "
73,42," The Plaintiffs infer the existence of cross-subsidization from the fact that CP&L charged a lower rate to the EDCs than to other 
customers. But differences in customer rates does not prove cross-subsidization. The Plaintiffs have failed to offer substantial 
evidence that the low rates to the EDCs were causally related to the higher rates that other customers of CP&L paid."
73,43," The Commission's order stated that: The municipalities in their protest seemed to feel that this low rate which the Company is charging the REA Cooperatives 
resulted in a higher rate which the municipalities were asked to pay. We are quite certain that this position of the municipalities is 
not well taken for the reason that if the Company had to construct the various transmission lines and extend electric service to 
the various sections of their territory which are now served by the REA Cooperatives, that the over-all operating expenses of the 
Company would be greatly increased and the other customers would have to pay more to compensate for the loss sustained in 
serving the same rural customers direct. We therefore find as a fact that the protesting municipalities are not entitled to the REA 
rates. Order of North Carolina Utilities Commission (June 1, 1954), quoted in Scotland Neck, 243 N.C. at 200-01, 90 S.E.2d at 526. "
74,44," The cases which the Plaintiffs cite for support-- Instructional Sys. Dev. Corp. v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 817 F.2d 639 
(10th Cir. 1987); Marsann Co. v. Brammall, Inc., 788 F.2d 611 (9th Cir. 1986); Richter Concrete Corp. v. Hilltop Concrete Corp., 
691 F.2d 818 (6th Cir. 1982); William Inglis & Sons Baking Co. v. ITT Continental Baking Co., 668 F.2d 1014 (9th Cir. 1981), 
cert. denied, 459 U.S. 825, 74 L. Ed. 2d 61, 103 S. Ct. 57, 103 S. Ct. 58 (1982); Chillicothe Sand & Gravel Co. v. Martin Marietta 
Corp., 615 F.2d 427 (7th Cir. 1980); Pacific Eng'g & Prod. Co. v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 551 F.2d 790 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 434 
U.S. 879, 98 S. Ct. 234, 54 L. Ed. 2d 160 (1977); International Air Indus., Inc. v. American Excelsior Co., 517 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 
1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 943, 47 L. Ed. 2d 349, 96 S. Ct. 1411 (1976)--are inapplicable. These cases recognize that 
predation is more likely to occur in markets with high entry barriers because rivals cannot easily enter the market to prevent 
recoupment. But none of these decisions stand for the proposition that erecting barriers to entry rather than recoupment is a 
plausible goal of a predatory pricing scheme."
74,45," The Supreme Court also stated that predation is not ""rational"" without the expectation of recovering ""more than the losses 
suffered."" 475 U.S. at 588-89."
74,46," The electricity rate charged to a customer is determined the by cost of producing electricity at all plants which generate 
electricity and not just one plant."
74,47," The clear trend in predatory pricing cases is to focus on cost evidence rather than direct or circumstantial evidence. Recent 
decisions have indicated that by itself direct evidence of predatory intent is insufficient to uphold Sherman Act antitrust verdicts 
for plaintiffs. See Morgan v. Ponder, 892 F.2d 1355, 1359 (8th Cir. 1989); A.A. Poultry Farms, Inc. v. Rose Acre Farms, Inc., 881 
F.2d 1396, 1400-02 (7th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1019, 110 S. Ct. 1326, 108 L. Ed. 2d 501 (1990). Circumstantial 
evidence is equally disfavored. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587-88. "
75,48," There is no evidence in the record that any of the Plaintiff EDCs objected to the 7.5 mills per kwh rate set by CP&L in 1945. In 
fact, this rate was the result of negotiations between CP&L, the EDCs, and the REA. At no time did the EDCs object to the 7.5 
mills per kwh rate on the ground that it prevented NCEMC from obtaining REA financing for a G&T system. Having enjoyed the 
benefit of this low rate for twenty-six years, the EDCs cannot press their claim decades later after electricity prices have risen."
75,49," Otter Tail is instructive. In Otter Tail, a dominant utility ""attempted to prevent communities in which its retail distribution 
franchise had expired from replacing it with a municipal distribution system"" by instituting litigation designed to delay such a 
system; refusing to sell at wholesale; refusing to wheel power; and refusing to provide access to its transmission lines. Id. at 368. 
The Supreme Court enjoined this conduct because the ""use of monopoly power 'to destroy threatened competition' is a violation 
. . . of § 2 of the Sherman Act."" Id. at 377 (citing Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, 342 U.S. 143, 154, 96 L. Ed. 162, 72 S. Ct. 
181 [1951]; Eastman Kodak Co. v. Southern Photo Materials Co., 273 U.S. 359, 375, 71 L. Ed. 684, 47 S. Ct. 400 [1927])."
75,50," CP&L states ""plaintiffs also allege that CP&L precluded development of their G&T system by refusing to provide them with 
various coordination services, but plaintiffs seek no damages based upon any such alleged refusals."" Memorandum of 
Defendant Carolina Power & Light Company in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment on Grounds of Insufficient Evidence of 
Monopolization, at 2 n.1 (July 3, 1986). "
76,51," As mentioned earlier, the REA would lend money for G&T construction only if (1) there was no cheap, dependable source of 
power available to the rural EDCs, and (2) the rates offered by existing power sources would result in a higher cost of power to 
the borrowers than the cost of power from G&T facilities financed by the REA. The Plaintiffs contend that the 7.5 mills per kwh 
rate prevented them from getting a two per cent (2%) REA loan to build their own G&T system because the cost of power from 
that system would be greater than the alleged below-cost rate CP&L charged them."
76,52," The only gray area relates to the Plaintiffs' claim regarding Electric Power in the Carolinas since those overt acts of CP&L took 
place both before and after the statute of limitations cut-off date. It is unclear from the evidence before the court whether there 
were sufficient post-limitations acts of CP&L relating to Electric Power in the Carolinas to establish a viable claim. If there were 
sufficient acts, the court holds that the Plaintiffs have standing to pursue them because by the early-1970s NCEMC and the 
EDCs had the financing needed to pursue such projects."
76,53," NCEMC negotiated with Duke Power for power exchange services in the mid-1970's. During these negotiations, Duke Power 
made it clear that NCEMC would have to put up $ 200 million in capital in 1975 for serious negotiations to take place. NCEMC 
ultimately financed a $ 1.6 billion deal with Duke Power in 1980 when it purchased an interest in Duke Power's Catawba Nuclear 
Unit."
76,54," Under the doctrine of state action immunity, state regulation can immunize activities otherwise in violation of the antitrust laws 
if the challenged activities are taken pursuant to a clearly articulated state policy and are actively supervised by the state. See 
Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v. United States, 471 U.S. 48, 57, 85 L. Ed. 2d 36, 105 S. Ct. 1721 (1985)."
76,55," Under the doctrine of implied immunity, courts can imply immunity from the antitrust laws when enforcement of those laws 
would interfere with the operation of a federal regulatory agency. See, e.g., Gordon v. New York Stock Exch., Inc., 422 U.S. 659, 
691, 45 L. Ed. 2d 463, 95 S. Ct. 2598 (1975) (stock exchange rules allowing for the fixing of commission rates immune from the "
77,," antitrust laws since Congress intended to leave the supervision of commission rates to the Securities and Exchange 
Commission)."
77,56," In Keogh v. Chicago & N.R. Co., 260 U.S. 156, 160-62, 67 L. Ed. 183, 43 S. Ct. 47 (1922), the Supreme Court decided that 
because the challenged uniform freight rates were contained in published tariffs filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission 
they could not be the basis for an award of antitrust damages. More recent cases have narrowed the doctrine. See City of 
Kirkwood v. Union Elec. Co., 671 F.2d 1173 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1170, 103 S. Ct. 814, 74 L. Ed. 2d 1013 
(1983); City of Mishawaka v. Indiana & Michigan Elec. Co., 560 F.2d 1314 (7th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 922, 56 L. Ed. 
2d 765, 98 S. Ct. 2274 (1978)."
77,57," The Plaintiff EDCs cite rate-making activity after August 17, 1973, as part of CP&Ls anticompetitive conduct. Rate disputes 
between the EDCs and CP&L relating to the amount of the rate increase and to the pancaking of rate increases comprise these 
complained of activities. The EDCs admit that they have already recovered rate overcharges through the regulatory process. 
Therefore, the EDCs may not claim damages from the post-August 17, 1973, power rates charged by CP&L."
77,58," The court's ruling on the insufficiency of the evidence to support Plaintiffs' predatory pricing claims is, of course, an alternative 
basis for the rejection of these claims. "
80,1," It is fairly clear how the district court connected this conclusion to its rejection of Clifford's specific claims. On the 
monopolization claim, the court's reasoning seems to be that, because Clifford was free to compete with Lo-Jack in marketing of 
SVRNs, there was no monopolization. The second claim, monopolization of an essential facility, was explicitly rejected by the 
court, on the basis that, with only one product involved, there was no separate ""facility,"" access to which was being evidently on "
81,," the ground that there could be no tying of one denied. The third claim, the illegal tie-in, was rejected product to another since 
there was only one product."
81,2," During argument, Clifford offered to a pay a de minimus fee for the cost of the changes that Lo-Jack would have to make in its 
computer program to accommodate Clifford's transponders. This is plainly not an access fee. An access fee must permit Lo-Jack 
to recoup all its business costs in the development and installation of the system and earn a reasonable profit. "
84,1," Although defendant styled this motion a ""Motion to Reconsider,"" what defendant is actually requesting is relief from a final order 
of the Court under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). HN1[
] Rule 60(b) provides that a ""court may relieve a party . . . from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons . . . (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the 
judgment."" The vehicle of a motion to reconsider simply does not exist in this context. See Lavespere v. Niagara Machine and 
Tool Works, Inc., 910 F.2d 167, 173 (5 Cir. 1990). "
85,2," In addition to the fact that both statutes authorize treble damages, the RICO-antitrust law analogy is particularly appropriate 
for at least two reasons. First, it appears that the RICO damages provision is modeled after the almost identical language of 
Section 4 of the Clayton Act. See National Mortgage Equity, supra at 1152. Second, RICO was originally proposed as an 
amendment to the Sherman Act, and the legislative history suggests that RICO addresses concerns similar to those at which the 
antitrust law is directed.  Id. at 1155-56, n. 24."
85,3," The Parello court specifically adopted the reasoning of National Mortgage Equity, and concluded that ""there is little room to 
argue that Congress would intend to allow the assignment of antitrust claims and would prohibit the assignment of RICO claims."" 
Parello, supra at *14. "
86,4," See Abell v. Potomac Insurance Company, 858 F.2d 1104, 1141, rehearing en banc denied, 863 F.2d 882 (5 Cir. 1988), 
vacated on other grounds, Fryar v. Abell, 492 U.S. 914, 106 L. Ed. 2d 584, 109 S. Ct. 3236 (1989)."
86,5," However, none of the cases recognizing that antitrust claims are assignable discuss the issue whether antitrust treble damages 
are punitive or remedial, nor do they discuss Rogers. "
87,6," TUL's central RICO claim on behalf of Harris is that Harris paid premiums through TUL to NPC, and NPC never placed the 
insurance coverage. RICO provides that a plaintiff can recover treble damages ""by reason of a violation of [the statute]."" 18 
U.S.C. § 1964(c). Clearly, any damages Harris sustained, according to TUL's theory, would include the premiums it paid for 
coverage that NPC was to place but allegedly did not."
87,7," Defendant's original motion to reconsider the Court's Order dismissing the RICO counterclaims also asked for leave to amend 
the Complaint in the event the Court found the pleadings insufficient to state a cause of action. The Court denied leave to amend 
the claims on which it denied reconsideration (those other than the claims TUL asserts as Harris Well Service's assignee.). Here, 
there is nothing defendant could do in the way of additional pleading that could remedy the fundamental defect in the 
assignment. Accordingly, the Court denies defendant leave to amend its Complaint with respect to any RICO claims it asserts on 
behalf of Harris Well Service. "
95,1, TWA began operating a CRS in 1976. Eastern Airlines and Delta Airlines began operating CRSs in 1981.
95,2," The Deregulation Act eliminated both the Board itself and many of its functions. See 49 U.S.C. § 1551. Most of the Board's 
remaining functions were transferred to the Department of Transportation. See id. at § 1551(a)(1)(E). The CRS fee regulation 
remains in effect. See 14 C.F.R. § 255.5(a)."
95,3," At the conclusion of pretrial proceedings in September 1989, two separate CRS cases were ready for trial: (1) a suit by 
Northwest Airlines against American Airlines, and (2) a suit by Alaska Airlines, Midway Airlines, and Muse Air Corporation (now 
part of Southwest Airlines) against United Airlines. The district court consolidated these cases and tried both of them 
simultaneously, a decision that has not been appealed."
95,4," Plaintiffs also asserted a third Section 2 claim, arguing that each defendant had unlawfully acquired and then exercised 
monopoly power over travel agents in the market for CRS services. This third claim was tried by a jury, which returned a verdict 
in favor of each defendant. Plaintiffs do not appeal these jury verdicts. "
96,5," Defendants contend that, in response to the standing challenge, plaintiffs defined the relevant market as CRS services to both 
travel agents and airlines. Defendants are incorrect. Plaintiffs argued that the market was identical to the one approved by the 
district court in its summary judgment opinion, In re Air Passenger Computer Reservations Systems Antitrust Litigation, 694 F. 
Supp. 1443 (1988). While the court in that opinion does use loose language suggesting that the relevant market consists of CRS 
services to both travel agents and airlines, in its decision on the standing motion, the district court explained that, in its summary 
judgment opinion, ""[it] undertook to analyze the relevant markets to CRS services to travel agents and found that the plaintiff 
airlines were consumers in that market for the purpose of establishing a Section 2 monopolization claim."" (ER, vol. I, at 440). 
Thus, even if plaintiffs alleged that the market included services to both airlines and travel agents, it is obvious that the district 
court did not base its decision on this allegation. "
97,6," Private treble damage actions for violations of the Sherman Act are authorized by Sections 4 and 5(a) of the Clayton Act.  15 
U.S.C. §§ 15, 16."
97,7," In Copperweld the Court considered the validity of the ""intra-enterprise conspiracy"" doctrine. The Court faced the question 
whether a wholly-owned subsidiary corporation and its parent corporation could ""conspire"" with each other for purposes of 
Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 767. It is apparent from the Copperweld opinion that the Court relied 
heavily on its analysis of the relationship between sections 1 and 2 of the Act in concluding that a wholly owned subsidiary 
cannot ""conspire"" with its parent. See id. at 767-69, 774-77. "
98,8," Plaintiffs based their claims against defendants on Section 2 of the Sherman Act in the district court, in their opening brief, and 
at oral argument. Thus, we do not consider the viability of any claims that plaintiffs might have had under Section 1 of the Act. 
See United States v. Munoz, 746 F.2d 1389, 1390 (9th Cir. 1984) (refusing to consider a tort theory not raised below in a 
contract action)."
98,9," We considered the essential facilities doctrine only very briefly in Ferguson v. Greater Pocatello Chamber of Commerce Inc., 
848 F.2d 976, 983 (9th Cir. 1988), before concluding it was inapplicable on the facts before us. "
100,10," As the Weider court noted, some commentators have suggested that the essential facilities doctrine be applied only to 
facilities that are ""'natural monopolies, facilities whose duplication is forbidden by law, and perhaps those that are publicly 
subsidized and thus could not practicably be built privately.'"" Id. at 569 (quoting P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law 
para. 736.2 at 680-81 (1988 Supp.)). The reason for such a limitation is that control of a natural monopoly facility gives the 
facility holder a power to eliminate downstream competition that is permanent even in theory, as well as in practice. See 3 P. 
Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law 47-48 (1978). Such a strict limitation goes further than Weider, and perhaps Olympia. "
101,11," The cases also seem to contemplate a second condition that must be satisfied for a facility to be considered ""essential"" in 
addition to the power to eliminate competition: The power to eliminate competition must not be momentary, but must be at least 
relatively permanent. See MCI, 708 F.2d at 1133 (discussing virtual impossibility of duplicating AT&T's local distribution 
facilities); Olympia, 797 F.2d at 379 (discussing possibility that Olympia ""remained free to compete by sending salesmen to call 
on Western Union's subscribers.""). In the instant case we need not decide whether defendants' control of their respective CRSs 
gave them power that was of sufficient permanence for the CRSs to qualify as essential facilities. For we conclude that the 
extent of the power bestowed on defendants by Apollo and SABRE, quite apart from the duration of this power, was insufficient."
101,12," Monopoly control of the upstream market is a necessary element of essential facility and monopoly leveraging claims. 
Defendants contend that plaintiffs' claims fail as a matter of law because the jury has decided that defendants do not have 
monopoly control in the upstream CRS market. However, the jury did not directly consider whether defendants had monopoly power in the CRS market for services to airlines. 
The jury was specifically instructed to consider only whether defendants possessed monopoly power over the travel agent 
participants in the CRS market. Since jurors are presumed to follow the instructions given, see United States v. Escalante, 637 
F.2d 1197, 1202 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 856, 66 L. Ed. 2d 71, 101 S. Ct. 154 (1980), we reject defendants' contention 
that the jury directly considered the extent of defendants' monopoly power over plaintiffs. Neither did the jury implicitly decide that defendants lacked monopoly power over plaintiffs. See In re Westgate-Cal. Corp., 642 
F.2d 1174, 1176 (9th Cir. 1981) (holding that collateral estoppel barred plaintiff's claim because the jury's previous decision that 
plaintiff had engaged in fraud effectively resolved the newly presented question whether plaintiff had acted inequitably). Plaintiffs 
and the travel agent participants in the CRS market are not similarly situated. Plaintiffs alleged that they had no real alternative 
to membership in either SABRE or Apollo because withdrawal would result in a business loss of such magnitude that no 
member airline could withstand it. In contrast, aside from contractual limitations, travel agents can switch CRSs whenever they 
desire. A travel agent must belong to only one CRS to obtain the information that she needs to operate her business, and there 
are a number of CRSs to which the travel agent may subscribe. This factual difference indicates that the jury's decision could not 
have included a finding that the defendants had monopoly power over plaintiffs."
101,13," We do not reach the question of whether at some level, charging a price may be the same as an outright refusal to deal. "
102,14," We highlight that this is not a case in which a facility holder has the power to eliminate competition in a downstream market, 
but has as yet exercised its power to only a limited extent. The essential facilities doctrine, consistent with principles underlying 
section 2, might well reach such conduct, because in that situation, the danger of monopolization may be immediate enough to 
satisfy the Act."
102,15," Defendants claim that plaintiffs waived their monopoly leveraging claim by failing to raise the claim in the district court. It is well 
established that an appellate court will not reverse a district court on the basis of a theory that was not raised below. See Image 
Technical Service, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak, 903 F.2d 612, 615 n. 1 (9th Cir. 1990) (holding that plaintiff's failure to raise an issue 
in opposition to a defendant's motion for summary judgment waived the issue), cert. granted, 501 U.S. 1216, 111 S. Ct. 2823, 
115 L. Ed. 2d 994 (1991); Munoz, 746 F.2d at 1390 (refusing to consider a tort theory not raised in contract action below). 
However, there is no factual basis supporting defendants' contention. First, plaintiffs raised the monopoly leveraging claim at the 
outset of their action. Second, although plaintiffs emphasized the essential facilities theory in their response to defendants' 
motion for summary judgment, they also discussed Griffith, a monopoly leveraging case, and mentioned the monopoly 
leveraging doctrine. Most importantly, the district court discussed the theory at length. See In Re Air Passenger Computer 
Reservation System Antitrust Litigation, 694 F. Supp. at 1472-75. Thus, we reject defendants' waiver argument. "
103,16," Plaintiffs also rely on two other cases, neither of which need be addressed at length. First, although United States v. Griffith, 
334 U.S. 100, 92 L. Ed. 1236, 68 S. Ct. 941 (1948), does contain some broad language, it is not controlling since it is a Section 1 
case involving concerted action. See Copperweld, 467 U.S. 774-77, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (noting the difference between Section 1's 
focus on concerted activity and Section 2's focus on unilateral activity). Plaintiffs also cite Kerasotes Mich. Theatres, Inc. v. National Amusements, Inc., 854 F.2d 135 (6th Cir. 1988), cert. dismissed 
sub nom., G.K.C. Mich. Theatres, Inc. v. National Amusements, Inc., 490 U.S. 1087, 104 L. Ed. 2d 982, 109 S. Ct. 2461 (1989). 
In Kerasotes, the Sixth Circuit held that the use of monopoly power in one market to gain a competitive advantage in a second 
market is forbidden, even when there is no danger of monopolization in the second market.  Id. at 137-38. Kerasotes is in error 
for the same reasons that Berkey Photo is in error. "
104,17," We highlight that this case does not involve the special problem of a regulated monopolist (usually a natural monopolist) that 
seeks to evade regulations which limit profits in the monopoly market by creeping into adjacent, unregulated markets. Such a 
case might present very different issues. "
115,1," Although Smith is the first-named plaintiff in this action, for the sake of consistency with the reported decisions in the underlying 
antitrust case this opinion refers to plaintiffs collectively as ""Sterling,"" which unlike Smith was a party to the antitrust action. In the 
interest of simplicity this opinion also speaks of defendants collectively as ""Law Firm,"" even though three of its partners are also 
sued individually."
115,2," At some point--apparently between the close of trial and the filing of the motion for j.n.o.v.--Kirkland & Ellis began to serve as 
co-counsel for Sterling. Kirkland & Ellis served as counsel of record in the antitrust appeals before our Court of Appeals, but it 
does not represent Sterling in the current malpractice action."
115,3," Both Smith and Sterling are Delaware corporations, with Smith's principal place of business being in Wisconsin and with 
Sterling (now inactive) having no place of business at all. All the partners in Law Firm (both named and unnamed as defendants) 
are Illinois citizens. "
116,4," HN1[
] ""Partial summary judgment"" in the present context is to the Federal Rules as Bigfoot is to zoology--a frequently 
""sighted"" but nonexistent animal. If a ruling for the moving party in a Rule 56 summary judgment motion does not dispose of the 
entire case, or of an entire cause of action within a larger case, then it is not a Rule 56 motion at all. Here even if Sterling wins 
on causation it must still prove negligence in order to recover. Pretrial resolution of this sort of significant but not necessarily 
dispositive legal issue is more comfortably placed under the rubric of Rule 16, which grants the trial judge broad discretion to 
shape the course of litigation. It may be noted parenthetically that one of the purposes sought to be accomplished by the 
proposed major revision of Rule 56 that was dropped from the originally proposed June 12, 1989 package of Rules amendments 
by the Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Judicial Conference (see pages 105-20 of the report of the 
Advisory Committee on Civil Rules, reprinted at 110 S.Ct. 370-85 in the section of that volume preceding the reporting of 
Supreme Court decisions) would have brought the current motion within the scope of that Rule. "
117,5," This Court approaches that task of reconsideration with a good deal of diffidence. Those of us who labor in the District Court 
vineyards are rarely called upon to sit in the equivalent of appellate scrutiny of the views of our own respected colleagues. Thus 
when we Illinois District Judges sit by designation with our Court of Appeals, only cases originating in Indiana or Wisconsin are 
placed on the docket for argument. About the only occasionally-encountered instances that are comparable to the present one 
are those other situations in which a case is transferred from one District Judge's calendar to another's (for any one of a number 
of reasons) and the second judge is then asked to revisit an earlier substantive ruling by the first. "
120,6, Neither party suggests the existence of any such later decision.
120,7," As reflected in the text discussion that follows, the issuance of a holding to that effect is essentially the invitation that Law Firm 
extends to this Court."
120,8," Law Firm all but accuses Judge Easterbrook, who as a lawyer also had been counsel for petitioner in Jefferson Parish and who 
then as a judge authored the Will opinion, of wilfully misreading Jefferson Parish in order to convert his personal views into law. 
That argument is as unacceptable as it is tactically senseless. On the first level, Judge Easterbrook's intellectual integrity is not 
at issue. And as for the second, if the matter were viewed solely in strategic terms (as it clearly cannot be), Law Firm could 
hardly expect Judge Easterbrook or his colleagues to agree with Law Firm's groundless accusation should the malpractice case 
go up on appeal."
120,9," Complaint para. 33 says that the interest accrued on the judgment, as of the time the Supreme Court had denied certiorari after 
P & E II, brought the amount of Smith's obligation to Sterling up to $ 5.844 million--so that was what Smith paid. Of course 
Smith's recovery against Law Firm, if it were successful here, would also include interest accrued during the more than two 
years that have elapsed since then. And Smith asks for an award of attorneys' fees as well. "
124,10," HN29[
] Even the majority opinion in Jefferson Parish, though essentially a restatement of traditional tying law, ""appears to 
have retreated from [the] stern position"" that ""tying arrangements exist[] only to inhibit competition"" ( Foremost Sales 
Promotions, Inc. v. Director, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, 860 F.2d 229, 237 & n. 11 (7th Cir. 1988))."
124,11," Two District Courts in the Seventh Circuit have shared Sterling's difficulty in that respect. Judge Michael Mihm's opinion in 
State of Illinois ex rel. Hartigan v. Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co., 730 F. Supp. 826, 931 (C.D. Ill. 1990), aff'd on other 
grounds, 935 F.2d 1469 (7th Cir. 1991), accepted the Sandburg and Will statements about tied market power as circuit law, 
although acknowledging them as dictum because the panel in P & E I had rejected those statements in dictum. With all respect 
to Judge Mihm, this Court adheres to the just-completed analysis as demonstrating that Sandburg and Will did not establish 
HN30[
] tied market power as an element of a per se tying case. Two years earlier this Court's colleague Honorable Charles 
Norgle, in Return on Investment Systems v. Translogic Corp., 702 F. Supp. 677, 680-81 (N.D. Ill. 1988), cited Sandburg and Will 
on tied market power with approval. It appears from his brief opinion that the parties there did not contest the issue of whether 
tied market power was an element of the claim; their dispute rather centered on whether the plaintiff's complaint made 
allegations adequate to prove that assumed element. It is therefore not surprising, nor is it persuasive to this Court, that Judge 
Norgle did not go out of his way to disprove the existence of the element as circuit law."
124,12," That statement ought to be hedged a bit. Because this opinion deals with what is not a true summary judgment motion, limited 
as it is to a single potentially dispositive issue (see n.3 and the Appendix to this Court's opinion in Teamsters Local 282 Pension 
Trust Fund v. Angelos, 649 F.Supp. 1242, 1252-53 (N.D. Ill. 1986)), if our Court of Appeals were to disagree with the conclusion 
reached here this case would need the full-blown added discovery and legal development essential to a trial (or perhaps to a 
true summary judgment motion) on the remaining issues. "
128,1," Plaintiffs, Sea Air Shuttle Corporation d/b/a VISS and Sea Air Shuttle Corporation of the Virgin Islands, contend that an 
exclusive lease has been awarded, while defendants assert that only an opportunity to negotiate a lease has been granted. As 
this issue has no effect upon the decision, the Court offers no opinion as to whether a lease has been awarded. For purposes of 
convenience in this opinion, the Court will refer to a lease as if one exists between defendants Virgin Islands Port Authority and 
Caribbean Airboats, Inc. This mere use of convenience in expression should not be interpreted as a conclusion that a lease in 
fact exists between the two defendants."
128,2," The Noerr-Pennington doctrine arises from decisions by the Supreme Court in Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference et al. 
v. Noerr Motor Freight Inc., et al., 365 U.S. 127 (1961) and United Mine Workers of America v. Pennington et al., 381 U.S. 657 
(1965). Essentially, the Noerr-Pennington doctrine supports the proposition that private activity is immune from antitrust liability if 
the imposition of such liability would infringe upon the private actor's first amendment right to petition the government. For a 
thorough discussion and analysis of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine: see Bradley, Noerr-Pennington Immunity From Antitrust 
Liability Under Clipper Express v. Rocky Mountain Motor Tariff Bureau, Inc.: Replacing The Sham Exception With A 
Constitutional Analysis, 68 Cornell L. Rev. 1305 (1984). "
129,3," Plaintiff Sea Air contends that CAS is Sea Air's predecessor in interest and that Sea Air has been assigned CAS' full interest in 
the CAS bid submitted to VIPA. For purposes of this decision, the Court shall assume that Sea Air has in fact been assigned 
CAS' full interest in the CAS bid submitted to VIPA. "
130,4," The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision in Sakamoto, 613 F.Supp. 381, (D.C. Guam 1983); aff'd 764 F.2d 1285 
(9th Cir. 1985), and adopted the District Court's reasoning with respect to federal action immunity. For this reason, this Court 
relies upon the analysis and reasoning of both the Ninth Circuit and the District Court in Sakamoto."
130,5," Sea Air correctly notes that antitrust immunity is not lightly imputed.  United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, 374 U.S. 
321, 350-51 (1963). This principle, however, does nothing to change the governmental immunity doctrine created by the courts 
to protect the federal government from scrutiny intended for more purely commercial transactions.  See Sea Land Service, Inc. 
v. The Alaska Railroad, 659 F.2d 243 (D.C. Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 919 (1982) (holding that a railroad operated and 
owned by the federal government was immune from antitrust liability). "
131,6," The Third Circuit in Norman's on the Waterfront, Inc. v Wheatley, 444 F.2d 1011 (1971), rejected the notion that state action 
immunity protected the Virgin Islands law by distinguishing the legislative scheme and stating ""the latest cases are in accord with 
the principle that an arrangement sponsored by the state is not necessarily state action for purposes of the antitrust laws."" Id. at 
1017 (citations omitted). We cannot accept the notion that simply because the Third Circuit refused to apply state action 
immunity in Norman's that the Third Circuit implicitly that the recognized the applicability of the state action doctrine to the 
Government of the Virgin Islands. We also note that the Norman's decision occurred ten (10) years before the creation of federal 
action immunity in Sea-Land Service, Inc. v. The Alaska Railroad, 659 F.2d 243 (D.C Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 919 
(1982)."
131,7," The court in IT&E Overseas, Inc. rejected a plaintiff's claim that the Government of Guam and the Guam Telephone Authority 
(""GTA"") were subject to antitrust scrutiny. In distinguishing local government instrumentalities of both the District of Columbia 
and Puerto Rico from the Government of Guam and its agencies and instrumentalities, the IT&E Overseas court stated: ""the 
antitrust implications of actions undertaken by local government instrumentalities of the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 
both U.S. territories, have not been treated as actions of federal instrumentalities. Nevertheless, both the District of Columbia 
and Puerto Rico have different relationships with the federal government than the Government of Guam. The status of Guam 
and Puerto Rico cannot be equated: Puerto Rico is an incorporated territory while Guam is not. . . . Thus, Sakamoto expressly--
and quite correctly-- distinguished Guam from incorporated territories like Puerto Rico 'which are thought of as future states.'"" IT 
& E Overseas at 12 (citations omitted). We note that the Virgin Islands is an unincorporated territory. See Water Isle Hotel and 
Beach Club v. Kon Tiki St. Thomas, Inc., 795 F.2d 325, 327 (3d Cir. 1986)."
131,8," Plaintiff Sea Air raises these arguments in briefing on plaintiffs' motion for preliminary and permanent injunction and motion for 
summary judgment. Plaintiff cites the Third Circuit's decision in Harris v. Boreham, 233 F.2d 11 (3d Cir. 1956), in support of the 
position that the Virgin Islands should be treated as a state in applying governmental immunity doctrine. After examining the 
Harris decision and the Supreme Court's opinion in United States v. Wheeler, 435 U.S. 313, 321 (1978), we reject this argument. Sea Air also argues that since the Third Circuit has held that the Commerce Clause, Import-Export Clause, and Contract Clause 
apply to the Virgin Islands, JDS Realty Corp. v. Government of the Virgin Islands, 824 F.2d 256 (3d Cir. 1987), vacated and 
remanded, 484 U.S. 999 (1988), appeal dismissed as moot, 852 F.2d 67 (3d Cir. 1988), this Court must apply the Sherman Act 
to the Government of the Virgin Islands as well. Contrary to plaintiff's assertion, the Third Circuit in JDS Realty Corp. did not find 
that the Commerce Clause applied to the Virgin Islands because the Virgin Islands possessed attributes of sovereignty similar to 
that of a state.  Rather, the Third Circuit in JDS Realty Corp. found ""that the powers granted to Congress by the commerce 
clause are implicit in the territorial clause."" Id. at 260 (citations omitted). Clause apply to the Virgin Islands, JDS Realty Corp. v. 
Government of the Virgin Islands, 824 F.2d 256 (3d Cir. 1987), vacated and remanded, 484 U.S. 999 (1988), appeal dismissed 
as moot, 852 F.2d 67 (3d Cir. 1988), this Court must apply the Sherman Act to the Government of the Virgin Islands as well. 
Contrary to plaintiff's assertion, the Third Circuit in JDS Realty Corp. did not find that the Commerce Clause applied to the Virgin 
Islands because the Virgin Islands possessed attributes of sovereignty similar to that of a state.  Rather, the Third Circuit in JDS "
132,," Realty Corp. found ""that the powers granted to Congress by the commerce clause are implicit in the territorial clause."" Id. at 260 
(citations omitted)."
132,9," We also note that Plaintiff Sea Air brought this complaint after its own bid to be the exclusive lessee of VIPA's seaplane ramps 
was rejected. "
133,10," We note for purposes of clarity that we do not believe that state action doctrine should be applied to the Government of the 
Virgin Islands in light of the Ninth Circuit's decision in Sakamoto."
133,11," CAI argues that (1) no conspiracy exists between CAI and VIPA under the Sherman Act; (2) the Noerr-Pennington doctrine 
wholly protects CAI because no formal lease exists between CAI and VIPA; and (3) plaintiffs lack standing to bring an antitrust 
action since plaintiffs can demonstrate no antitrust injury. "
134,12," Sea Air offers no persuasive argument against the application of Noerr-Pennington protection to CAI in regard to the Sea Air's 
claim against CAI under the Virgin Islands Antimonopoly Act. "
137,*," The Honorable Ann Aldrich, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio, sitting by designation. "
142,1," Ahern's major supplier at this time was Omark Industries. Windsor -- from which Ahern said he was purchasing only five 
percent of his requirements -- reported bar and chain sales of $ 62,737 to Ahern in the fiscal year ending in July of 1983. Ahern's 
purchases from Windsor increased only a very modest $ 3,886 in fiscal year 1984. Omark terminated its distributor arrangement with Ahern on March 22, 1984, and in the fiscal year that followed the termination 
Ahern made bar and chain purchases from Windsor of $ 257,635. This increase resulted from the fact that Ahern could no 
longer buy directly from Omark, he testified, and not from the fact that Windsor had stopped selling to Bailey. "
143,2," There was a decrease in purchases by Jim Jeffrey, the Sacramento distributor who was also present in Reno. Jeffrey's bar and 
chain purchases dropped from $ 13,191 in fiscal year 1983 to $ 10,203 in fiscal year 1984. "
144,3," Johnson did not attend the meeting with Ahern and Braswell at Reno. Johnson testified at his deposition that although he had 
heard of Braswell, he had never spoken to him. Johnson's purchases of bars and chain from Windsor went from $ 259,465 in 
1983 to $ 269,123 in 1984, an increase of less than 4 percent. "
145,4," The actual words of the statute are more sweeping: HN1[
] ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or 
conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" There 
is a sense in which every commercial contract is a restraint of trade, however, see National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Board of 
Regents of Oklahoma, 468 U.S. 85, 98, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70, 104 S. Ct. 2948 (1984), and the Supreme Court has never been willing 
to read the Sherman Act as declaring every commercial contract illegal. Section 1, the Court has said, was intended to prohibit 
only ""unreasonable restraints of trade."" Id. This phrase is often used interchangeably with ""unreasonable restraints on 
competition,"" and the latter formulation may be somewhat more descriptive of what is actually prohibited. See Continential T.V., 
Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 49, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977), and Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp 
Electronics Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 723, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808, 108 S. Ct. 1515 (1988). "
147,5," For court of appeals decisions that appear to foreshadow Monsanto, see, in addition to Edward J. Sweeney & Sons, Inc. v. 
Texaco, Inc., 637 F.2d 105 (3d Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 911, 68 L. Ed. 2d 300, 101 S. Ct. 1981 (1981), Packard Motor

338, 99 S. Ct. 340 (1978). Davis-Watkins Co. v. Service Merchandise, 686 F.2d 1190 (6th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 931, 
80 L. Ed. 2d 190, 104 S. Ct. 1718 (1984), while generally in harmony with the views expressed here, contains a suggestion that 
although non-price vertical restraints originating in unilateral action by the manufacturer are permissible, the same restraints may 
be impermissible if they result from concerted action among distributors and manufacturers. To the extent that the latter 
proposition is inconsistent with the Supreme Court's subsequent decision in Monsanto, it is no longer good law. "
149,6," Plaintiff Bailey may well have made a similar election in the case at bar. Although Bailey presented a rule of reason argument 
before the district court, basing its presentation primarily on Federal Trade Commission v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, 476 
U.S. 447, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445, 106 S. Ct. 2009 (1986), that argument has not been renewed here. Indeed, Bailey's opening brief on 
appeal says that ""Bailey's is proceeding in this appeal solely on the theory of group boycott. . . ."" (Emphasis supplied.) "
153,1," The Court found that the anti-discrimination provisions of the Robinson-Patman Act had no applicability to the purchase and 
sale of insurance. The Clayton Act claims were dismissed because there were no allegations that the defendant's conduct was 
designed to perpetuate or obtain monopoly power."
153,2," According to plaintiff's estimates, the number of its members was 750 in 1984, 1,000 in 1986, and 1,200 in 1987. See 
Deposition of Sandra Wagner (""Wagner Dep."") at 143; see also Defendants' Rule 3(g) Statement of Material Facts in Support of 
Motion for Summary Judgment (""Defendants' Rule 3(g) Statement"") at para. 33. "
154,3," The estimated membership for Long Island during 1984-86 grew from about 260 to about 300 members. See Deposition of Ray 
Blank (""Blank Dep."") at 10; Defendants' Rule 3(g) Statement at para. 34."
154,4," Empire State began its affiliation with Blue Cross in 1978, when it purchased a group hospitalization policy for its members. 
See Plaintiff's Rule 3(g) Statement of Material Facts in Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment (""Plaintiff's Rule 3(g) 
Statement"") at para. 2. In the late summer of 1984, Empire State contacted Blue Cross about purchasing a major medical 
insurance policy for its members. See Deposition of Jerome Sager (""Sager Dep."") at 122, 125; Affidavit of Sandra Wagner 
(""Wagner Aff."") at para. 3; Affidavit of Al Fisher (""Fisher Aff."") at para. 3. "
155,5," Defendants do not concede that the rate it applied to Long Island was incorrect and has reserved its right to argue at trial that 
the rate applied can be justified under its guidelines. See Defendants' Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary 
Judgment at 9 n.5; see also Zammit Dep. at 54-57, 65-67. However, taking the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, 
the Court will assume arguendo that the rate applied to Long Island was erroneous."
155,6," Plaintiff has submitted affidavits that assert that at a meeting in late 1984, representatives of Empire State told representatives 
of Blue Cross that Long Island had segmented into 29 groups to obtain community rated medical coverage and that one 
representative of Blue Cross, Mr. Harry Nicholsen, stated that he knew that Long Island had done so. See Wagner Aff. at paras. 
5-6; Al Fisher Aff. at 4. Mr. Nicholsen testified at his deposition, however, that when he was informed of Long Island's situation 
he stated only that he would investigate it. See Nicholsen Dep. at 44-45, 61, 65. This conflicting evidence, even when viewed in 
the light most favorable to the plaintiff, establishes only that Nicholsen may have known prior to late 1984 that Long Island was 
improperly receiving a lower rate. It is hardly sufficient to establish a conspiracy between Long Island and Blue Cross. Moreover, 
the circumstance that Nicholsen may have been Long Island's representative for a short time in the early 1970's, see Nicholsen 
Dep. at 44, is in itself insufficient to support an inference that he participated in a conspiracy because at all times relevant to this 
action he had no contact with Long Island. See Nicholsen Aff. at paras. 4-5. "
156,7," Defendants have submitted affidavits from all of the relevant Blue Cross personnel which flatly deny the existence of any illicit 
conspiracy, see, e.g., Affidavit of Jonathan F. Haley (""Haley Aff.) at para. 4; Affidavit of John F. Muldoon (""Muldoon Aff."") at para. 
5; Nicholsen Aff. at para. 5; Strassberg Aff. at 5; Rosenbluth at para. 4; Zammit Aff. at para. 4, and the plaintiff has failed to point 
to any evidence in the record which contradicts this testimony."
156,8," These acts, even if they could be properly imputed to Blue Cross might, since they were in derogation of Blue Cross' economic 
interest, arguably support an inference of conspiratorial as opposed to unilateral action. However, they would still be plainly 
insufficient to support the Sherman Act claims because those claims would still lack economic plausibility."
156,9," As further support for the argument that no conspiracy to drive Empire State out of business existed, defendants have 
submitted evidence establishing that Blue Cross negotiated and worked with Empire State in order to address problems Empire 
State was having in securing the requisite number of applicants for the major medical plan. According to Blue Cross' 
underwriting guidelines, a minimum of 75% of Empire State's members would have to apply for the major medical coverage 
before it could be issued. However, this requirement was modified in plaintiff's favor to require only that a minimum of 300 
applications be received from among plaintiff's membership. See Sager Dep. at 132; Wagner Dep. at 102; Exhibit 10; Exhibit 11; 
Letter of Jerome Sager to Erwin L. Werner, December 26, 1985; Defendant's Rule 3(g) Statement. In view of this evidence of 
accommodations to Empire State, the assertion of a conspiracy to drive Empire State out of business borders on the frivolous. Plaintiff attempts to further bolster its claim of a conspiracy between Blue Cross and Long Island to drive it out of business by 
pointing to two facts: 1) Blue Cross froze Empire State's hospitalization insurance group to prevent further enrollment; and, 2) 
Medicare-eligible members of Empire State were made ineligible for major medical coverage. However, these facts do not 
rationally support plaintiff's Sherman Act claims because as defendants correctly assert, they were of benefit to, rather than 
damaging to plaintiff. Plaintiff has not refuted this assertion. Freezing Empire State's hospitalization group enrollment assisted 
Empire State in meeting minimum enrollment requirements for major medical coverage, and rendering Medicare-eligible 
members ineligible for major medical coverage maintained a more favorable experience rating for Empire State by excluding the 
poor claims history that medicare-eligible members were more likely to have. HN1[

157,10," The Supreme Court decided Matsushita on March 26, 1986, almost two months before the original complaint was filed in this 
action, May 16, 1986, and a full year before the amended complaint, which is the paper relevant to this motion, was filed on May 
27, 1987."
157,11," Plaintiff's reliance upon Johnson v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of New Mexico, 677 F. Supp. 1112 (D.N.M. 1987), is misplaced. In 
that case, plaintiffs, a group of licensed chiropractors, sued Blue Cross of New Mexico (""BCNM""), the New Mexico Medical "
158,," Society (""NMMS""), and individual directors of each who were physicians, alleging a conspiracy to deny insurance coverage for 
chiropractic services. The district court denied defendants' summary judgment motion because the evidence of communications 
between the defendants indicated that BCNM agreed to forgo the new business that providing coverage for chiropractic services 
would have created in exchange for continued affiliation with and endorsement by the NMMS and its individual doctors. Although 
it was against BCNM's economic self-interest to do so, plaintiff demonstrated economic plausibility because BCNM's continued 
affiliation with the national Blue Cross organization required that BCNM be endorsed by the NMMS and the evidence 
demonstrated that the NMMS would withdraw its endorsement unless BCNM would refuse to provide insurance for chiropractic 
services. See id. at 1116. In the present case, in contrast, there has been no showing of an economically plausible reason for 
not charging a higher rate to both Empire State and Long Island. "
166,1," The trial court granted Triad injunctive relief which restrained the Caller Times ""from targeting Plaintiff's customers or potential 
customers for special deals or concessions."" The injunction was granted under the authority of section 15.21(b) of the Texas 
Business and Commerce Code. The Caller-Times challenged the injunction on the ground that it was overbroad and vague. 
Triad conceded that the injunction was overbroad and vague and the court of appeals dissolved the injunction.  791 S.W.2d 163, 
174. The injunction was not an issue in this court. "
167,2," Prior to the filing of the instant suit in state court, the majority shareholders in Triad Communications, David Mock and George 
Magel, filed suit twice in federal district court against the parent corporation of the Caller-Times, Harte-Hanks Communications, 
Incorporated, seeking relief under the Sherman Act from the Caller-Times' allegedly monopolistic conduct. The first time, the 
federal claims were dismissed without prejudice at the request of Mock and Magel. The federal claims were refiled and then 
dismissed with prejudice in November of 1985. Mock and Magel had requested a second dismissal without prejudice. However, 
the court granted dismissal with prejudice. In its order, the court stated that the dismissal was with prejudice because the cause 
had already been dismissed once without prejudice, because of the costs incurred by Harte-Hanks, and because the judge felt 
that Mock and Magel were only forum shopping. "

168,4," Some testimony during hearings on the 1983 Texas Antitrust Act urged the legislature to incorporate language into the Act

169,5," See, e.g., Northeastern Telephone, 651 F.2d at 88; Barry Wright Corp., 724 F.2d at 235."
169,6," This element of the test is equally appropriate even if the seller acts irrationally. HN10[
] Whether a seller acts rationally or 
irrationally, predatory conduct will be marked by the same objective factors. The fact finder can determine whether there was an 
objective rational economic motive even if the seller acted irrationally."
169,7," We are not faced with the question of what factors a court should consider to determine whether a seller will have an 
objectively reasonable expectation of recouping its losses. Relevant factors must be determined on a case by case basis. While 
we neither endorse every factor on this list nor exclude any other factor, we anticipate that the following factors would e relevant: "
170,," the type of goods or services in question; the economic condition of the predator; relative market strength of the seller; the 
number of competitors in the relevant market; nature of barriers to market entry; market demand; and the name recognition of 
the seller's products. We neither reject nor embrace the rule of reason as a tool for analysis of predatory pricing problems. However, by considering 
the objective factors peculiar to a particular business, the first part of this test is entirely consistent with the rule of reason. See 
The White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 261 (1963). HN11[
] ""The Rule [of Reason] does not open the field of 
antitrust inquiry to any argument in favor of a challenged restraint that may fall within the realm of reason. Instead, it focuses 
directly on the challenged restraint's impact on competitive conditions."" National Society of Professional Engineers v. United 
States, 435 U.S. 679, 688 (1978). See generally P. Joskow & A. Klevorick, A Framework for Analyzing Predatory Pricing Policy, 
89 Yale L.J. 213 (1979) (discussing the interaction of the rule of reason and per se rules in the context of predatory pricing 
analysis)."
170,8," The Seventh Circuit noted in Brunswick that ""the purpose of the antitrust laws as it is understood in the modern cases is to 
preserve the health of the competitive process . . . rather than to promote the welfare of particular competitors."" 752 F.2d 266. 
(citing Brown Shoe). Perhaps one reason why the dissent takes such a different view of the purpose of the antitrust laws is that 
the dissent relies on the position of turn of the century writers. The business environment and the tools for analysis of the 
business environment in this country have changed since Louis D. Brandeis wrote on antitrust in 1914. The dissent manages to infer from this opinion that it is predicated on the belief that predatory pricing is rare. The dissent argues 
that ""predatory pricing is a real danger,""    S.W.2d at    , and cites commentators for the proposition that predatory pricing exists. 
   S.W.2d at    , n.    . However, the dissent has not answered the Second Circuit's challenge in Northeastern Telephone Co. v. 
American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 651 F.2d 76, 88 (2nd Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 943 (1982). The Northeastern 
court noted that ""nowhere in the recent outpouring of literature on the subject do commentators suggest that [predatory] pricing 
is either common or likely to increase."" Id. There is a difference between saying that predatory pricing exists and saying that it is 
a real danger. "

173,21," Limit pricing is the monopolist's practice of pricing below its profit-maximizing price but above the price at which competitors

1980); Areeda & Turner, 3 Antitrust Law para. 714b (1978). An oversimplified example is when the monopolist's profit-maximizing price is $ 100 per unit, but a $ 100 price would attract entry while a $ 90 price would not. 
Average total costs (including a normal return on investment) at an efficient scale of output might be $ 80 to the monopolist but $ 
91 for newcomers. In that event, the monopolist will have to choose between inducing entry at the profit-maximizing price of $ 
100 and retaining the entire market at the $ 90 price. If the discounted income stream at the lower price exceeds that from 
sharing the market at the higher price, the monopolist will charge the lower price. Although the lower price would thus be the 
long-run, profit maximizing price, it is usually called a 'limit price' . . . ."

intent."
180,23," In fact, average total cost includes a necessary minimum profit, see McGahee, 858 F.2d at 1503; because of this, it is unclear 
what the intended dividing line is in the majority's test between ""average variable cost"" and ""short-run profit-maximizing price."" "
181,24," The court's lack of definition hides the fact that Bork and other law and economics enthusiasts consider there to be few if any 
actual barriers to entry. See Sources of Wisdom at 1215 (citing the Report of the White House Task Force on Antitrust Policy, 
separate statement of Robert H. Bork); see also Brodley & Hay at 770 (noting the difficulty of discerning existence of barriers to 
entry). The court does not make clear what circumstances will be included as barriers to entry. One reason advanced for the 
ineffectiveness of predatory behavior is that ""the victim [of such pricing] would merely have to show the predator [that the victim 
has a] new line f credit to dissuade the predator from attacking,"" because more credit would indicate that the victim could lower 
prices to match those of the predator. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox at 148; see also Harry S. Gerla, The Psychology of Predatory 
Pricing: Why Predatory Pricing Pays, 39 Sw. L.J. 755, 767 (1985) (hereinafter Gerla) (generally regarding the assumed 
availability of credit, noting that underestimation of problems in raising capital flaws, the theory that predatory pricing is 
ineffective). In today's economy, scarred as it is by the savings and loan crisis, credit has become far more difficult to obtain than 
in the mid-1970's when Bork wrote. Venture capital for entrepreneurs has been described as the ""Berlin Wall"" since ""money is 
hardly ever there . . . when a business is just starting."" Jeremy Schlosberg, The Start-Up Blues, The Washington Monthly, Jan. 
1989, at 25-27. Thus, lack of available credit arguable could serve as a barrier to entry."

test for finding high barriers to entry. See Brodley & Hay at 771."

184,40," See McGahee, 858 F.2d at 1496; Adjusters Replace-A-Car, 735 F.2d at 887. The somewhat confusing holding in Matsushita 
cannot be read as simply as this court urges.  Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 578. Additionally, this ruling may apply only to multi-
product firms similar to the Matsushita company itself, for such firms can more easily shift burdens of cost and production from 
one product to another. This, in turn, affects the ability to apply accurately a cost-based test. Finally, the Supreme Court was 
concerned only with the context of summary judgment, which is not at issue in the current case.  Id. at 577."
184,41," Describing antitrust as ""a subcategory of ideology,"" Bork, The Antitrust Paradox, at 408, or even a ""secular religion."" Bork, 
Contrasts in Antitrust Theory, at 401, Bork has established himself firmly as an antitrust atheist. This attitude conflicts sharply 
with the reasoning underlying the federal statutes that ""antitrust is a distinctive American means for assuring the competitive 
economy on which our political and social freedom under representative government in part depend."" The Report of the Attorney 
General's National Commission to Study the Antitrust Laws, quoted in S. Chesterfield Oppenheim & Glen E. Weston, Federal 
Antitrust Laws 4 (1968) (hereinafter Oppenheim & Weston)."
184,42," Holmes' dissent in Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U.S. 197 (1904) is described as ""a curiously inconsistent 
piece of work"" in which Holmes' view of the Sherman Act ""deprives it of any general policy goal and, almost, of any intelligible 
reason for existence."" Bork, The Antitrust Paradox, at 31. Bork characterizes Holmes' interpretation of the statute, which 
attempted to apply common law, 193 U.S. at 405, as having ""lapsed into an oblivion that seems deserved,"" and notes its only 
worth as having included some economic reasoning. R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox, at 32. Holmes was actually one of the first 
jurists to focus on intent in antitrust cases. See Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 375, 396 (1905)."
184,43," Brandeis' approach to antitrust law is attacked for his ""sympathy for small, perhaps inefficient, traders. . . ."" Bork, The 
Antitrust Paradox, at 41. Brandeis is also criticized for not laying out what a formalistic per se violation of the antitrust laws is, 
preferring instead an intent-based or rule of reason approach. Id. at 43-44. See Board of Trade of Chicago, 246 U.S. at 238 
(""Knowledge of intent may help the court to interpret facts and to predict consequences.""). Most remarkably, Bork characterizes 
Brandeis as having ""brought to prominence the idea that judges in antitrust cases could forward values opposed to consumer 
welfare."" Bork, The Antitrust Paradox, at 21-22."
184,44," Taft's opinion in United States v. Addyston Pipe & Steel Co., 85 Fed. 271 (6th Cir. 1898), is argued to be preferable to the 
humanistic approach of Holmes and Brandeis because it attempts to establish per se rules for illegality. See R. Bork, The "
185,," Antitrust Paradox, at 27. Taft's ""insight"" that combinations might be efficient economically is, to Bork, ""central to modern 
antitrust."" Id. at 28. At least one commentary has concluded to the contrary that Taft's opinion is utterly out of place in the 
modern business world. See Oppenheim & Weston at 4."
185,45," Ironically, courts are moving towards law and economics just as, at the same time, economists are moving away from the 
simplified assumptions of classical microeconomic theory. See Gerla at 779 & n. 124."
185,46," These commentators have agreed on the existence of predatory pricing, and have persuasively challenged the premise that it 
cannot rationally and successfully be employed. Sullivan, Antitrust § 43, at 110. See Yamey at 130 & 135; Scherer at 883, 889 & 
generally; F. M. Scherer, Industrial Market Structure and Economic Performance 335-40 (2d ed. 1980); Dirlam at 792; 
Williamson at 286-87; Brodley & Hay at 789; see generally Gerla. Even law and economics guru Richard Posner rejects the 
premise that, from an economist's standpoint, predatory pricing can never successfully occur. Posner at 515-518."
185,47," For a detailed discussion of the legislative history on predatory pricing, see McGahee, 858 at 1498-1500."
185,48," ""Homo economicus"" is a term coined to describe the implausible efficiency and wealth-maximizing creature imagined by 
classical economists. L. Thurow, Dangerous Currents 224 (1983). "
186,49," The court's approach is apparent in the very terms of its test. The existence of a ""short-term profit-maximizing price"" rests 
purely on a ""hypothesis"" that firms, in everything they do, aim to maximize profits. The MIT Dictionary of Modern Economics 
(David W. Pearce ed., 2d. ed. 1986)."
186,50," See, e.g., National Committee for the Review of Antitrust Laws, Report to the President and the Attorney General 150 (1979), 
cited in Gerla at 774 n. 99; Sullivan, Antitrust § 43, at 111; Dirlam at 813-14; Sources of Wisdom at 1232."
186,51," Although claiming to have ""neither rejected[ed] nor embraced the rule of reason . . . ,""    S.W.2d   , the court's prohibition of 
intent evidence represents a clear rejection of that Rule, which by definition does not categorically exclude an entire class of 
evidence. "
187,52," While reluctantly acknowledging the potential relevance of some of these factors to whether the seller has an ""objectively 
reasonable expectation of recouping its losses,""    S.W.2d   , the court offers neither guidance as to their application nor 
explanation of why some factors, but not others, may be ""objective."""
187,53," The four Justices dissenting in Matsushita criticized the majority's economic-oriented approach as making ""a number of 
assumptions that invade the factfinder's province,"" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 599 (White, J. dissenting), and that take matters from 
the hands of a jury.  Id. at 603-04 & n.4. That admonition is equally applicable here: the court ""is not required to engage in 
academic discussions about predation; it is required to decide whether respondent's evidence creates a genuine issue of 
material fact."" Id. at 606. Accord, Kelco Disposal, 845 F.2d at 408."
187,54," One commentator notes that in relation to a pure cost test, the fact that ""accounting records [are] in the hands of defendants"" 
results in ""inevitable slippage of the discovery process. . . ."" Pitofsky at 1066. "
188,55," Similarly, a new market entrant may price below short run cost and absorb losses as a way of acquiring a share of an existing 
market. See Carstensen at 960. Nevertheless, this court would bar such competitive behavior. "
189,56," Indeed, Areeda and Turner have conceded that their theories of efficiency work when applied to monopolies unless the 
monopolistic firm ""can discriminate in price among different customers."" 2 Phillip Areeda & Donald F. Turner, Antitrust Law § 
403b, at 271 (1978)."
189,57," The court entirely disregards statements of a Caller-Times employee relating to this subject. By not explaining how this 
evidence failed to constitute a showing of cost and profit, this court not only establishes an unworkable test, it offers no guidance 
on what evidence beyond testimony on cost and price need be introduced to meet that test."

198,3," Confidential data Rosenfeld submitted indicate that it controls approximately 3.5 percent of the relevant market. UXB, utilizing a 
smaller market and different figures, concludes that Rosenfeld may control up to 37 percent of the relevant market. "
203,1," As a result of the antitrust decree applicable to AT&T and the Bell Operating Companies, including NWB, the United States 
has been divided into LATA's (local access transport areas. See United States v. AT&T, 552 F. Supp. 131 (D.D.C. 1982), aff'd, 
460 U.S. 1001, 103 S. Ct. 1240, 75 L. Ed. 2d 472 (1983). Accordingly, long-distance telephone services have been divided into 
intra-LATA interexchange services and inter-LATA interexchange services depending upon whether the long-distance calls "
204,," originate and terminate within the same LATA. The AT&T antitrust decree prohibits NWB from providing inter-LATA 
interexchange services but permits the provision of intra-LATA long-distance services. "

232,2," See Compl. paras. 13-49. Prior to this complaint, in April 1986, Barr had commenced suit in the Southern District of New York 
also based on Abbott's practices in the erythromycin market. However, Barr subsequently withdrew its claims, and in October 
1987, by stipulation of the parties, the 1986 complaint was discontinued with prejudice. See Pl.'s Mem. in Opp'n (filed Mar. 7, 
1988) at 3-5; see generally Barr Lab., Inc. v. Abbott Lab., No. 87-4764 (D.N.J. filed Mar. 21, 1988)."

therefor, or discount from, or rebate upon, such price, on the condition, agreement, or understanding that the lessee or 
purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the goods . . . of a competitor or competitors of the lessor or seller, where the effect of 
such lease, sale, or contract for sale or such condition, agreement, or understanding may be to substantially lessen competition 
or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce."

(West Supp. 1991)."
234,6," Based on Barr's damages claims, the contracts at issue are Abbott's fiscal year 1986/87 single product (EES-400) contracts 
and Abbott's fiscal year 1987/88 global erythromycin requirements contracts. See Pre-Trial Order at 21-25. Abbott entered into 
global requirements contracts with 1) Hooks Drug Inc., 2) Jack Eckerd Corp., 3) Peoples Drug Stores, 4) Osco Drug Co., 5) 
Perry Distribution Center, 6) The Kroger Corp., 7) Thrift Drug Co., 8) Rite-Aid Corp., 9) Revco D.S. Inc., and 10) Walgreen Co. 
See Def.'s Ex. 31. The language on the face of the global contracts indicates that they are one year contracts. It is noteworthy that the purchasing records of two warehousing chain drugstores as well as Barr's own sales records reflect that 
several drugstores that had entered into the global contracts continued to purchase generic EES-400 from pharmacies other 
than Abbott. See Def.'s Br. (dated Feb. 24, 1989), Exs. 9, 12, 13; cf.  Barry Wright Corp. v. ITT Grinnell Corp., 724 F.2d 227, 
237-38 (1st Cir. 1983) HN8[

Antitrust Law §§ 303-04 (1978) (proof of Clayton Act and Sherman Act violations requires anticompetitive effect). But see  
American Motor Inns, 521 F.2d 1230, 1248 (3d Cir. 1975) (regardless of actual effect, contract contravenes Sherman § 1 if 
intended to monopolize, fix prices, or drive out competitor)."
235,8," Since Barr discusses only the foreclosure percentage caused by the global requirements contracts, the Court will focus on the 
same. See Pl.'s Mem. in Opp'n to Summ. J. at 7-10."
235,9," The contracts provided that: Abbott Laboratories will sell the following Abbott Erythromycin products at the following prices, provided that you purchase the 
annual minimum quantity of units of the products listed in each group below and each order you place for each respective 
product meets the ""Per Order Minimum"" quantities specified in the table below with respect to that product. See Def.'s Ex. 31 (emphasis added)."
235,10," The parties dispute whether the numerator of the foreclosure fraction should be limited to EES-400, see Def.'s Reply Br. for 
Summ. J. at 2-6, or should include all erythromycin products covered by the global requirements contracts that also fall within 
the jury's relevant product market determination. See Pl.'s Mem. in Opp'n to Summ. J. at 7-10. For the purpose of deciding this 
motion, the Court will assume the latter. "
236,11," Barr asserts that evidence regarding intent to monopolize is probative of the ""probable immediate and future effects of the 
contracts."" See Pl.'s Mem. in Opp'n to Summ. J. at 12-13. The available economic data, however, provides a more reliable basis 
for determining the potential anticompetitive effects of the contracts."
236,12," Barr contends that: ""Abbott, in fact, raised its prices on products covered by the global contracts for the 1988-1989 contract 
term."" Pl.'s Mem. in Opp'n to Summ. J. at 20 n.9 (emphasis in original). Barr, however, fails to provide a sufficient basis on which 
to compare these price increases with average market price increases. "
237,13," The parties additionally dispute the actual duration of the contracts. See Pl.'s Mem. in Opp'n to Summ. J. at 20-22; Def.'s Br. 
for Summ. J. at 19-21. Although there may be a genuine factual issue regarding the length of the contracts, the issue of duration 
does not change the outcome of the Court's analysis of anticompetitive effect."
237,14," Section 2 provides in relevant part that: HN12[
] ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine 
or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or 
with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony . . . ."" 15 U.S.C.A. § 2 (West Supp. 1991)."
237,15," In Tampa Electric, the Supreme Court held in part that: We need not discuss the respondents' further contention that the contract also violates § 1 and § 2 of the Sherman Act, for if it 
does not fall within the broader proscription of § 3 of the Clayton Act it follows that it is not forbidden by those of the former."
237,365," U.S. at 335. Clearly, if Barr's Sherman § 2 claim were limited to the factual predicate of the alleged exclusive dealing 
contracts, then the claims of monopolization and attempt to monopolize could be dismissed without further consideration. See  
Mozart Co. v. Mercedes-Benz, Inc., 833 F.2d 1342, 1352 (9th Cir. 1987), cert. denied,  488 U.S. 870 (1988);  Airweld, Inc. v. 
Airco, Inc., 742 F.2d 1184, 1191 n.3 (9th Cir. 1984), cert. denied,  469 U.S. 1213 (1985);  American Motor Inns, 521 F.2d at 
1250;  Denison Mattress Factory v. Spring-Air Co., 308 F.2d 403, 410 (5th Cir. 1962);  United Air Lines, Inc. v. Austin Travel 
Corp., 681 F. Supp. 176, 184 (S.D.N.Y. 1988), aff'd,  867 F.2d 737 (2d Cir. 1989). If, however, Barr were permitted to rely on 
evidence of additional ""bulk contracts,"" Abbott's use of uncoated EES-400 tablets, and the linkage of various erythromycin drugs 
in the global requirements contracts, then the scope of Tampa Electric is less clear. Cf.  American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 
328 U.S. 781, 811 (1946) (""material consideration in determining whether a monopoly exists is not that prices are raised and that 
competition actually is excluded but that power exists to raise prices or to exclude competition""); Pl.'s Mem. in Opp'n to Summ. J. 
at 32. "
238,16," Barr has offered a document indicating that Abbott's erythromycin strategy was to: ""(1) Sign Global Contracts with large chains 
to shut our competitors, (2) Establish 70-80% market share. Get marginal players out of the market, (3) Then raise prices."" See 
Pl.'s Ex. 53; see also Pl.'s Ex. 69 (Abbott White Paper on erythromycin strategy to ""discourage present and future bulk, generic 
and branded entrants, enabling us to raise prices and increase profitability""). Barr also has presented an interoffice 
correspondence expressing the goal of ""put[ting] together a package deal for a chain's entire erythromycin business . . . and 
lock[ing] out Barr and the generics."" See Pl.'s Ex. 379; cf.  Aspen Skiing, 472 U.S. at 608 n.39 (""Proof of specific intent to 
engage in predation may be in the form of statements made by the officers or agents of the company . . . .""). "
255,1," Sessions, which lined tanks in California and in other western states, is one of approximately 30 licensed applicators of Glass 
Armor epoxy in the United States. Glass Armor is produced by the Bridgeport Chemical Company, located in Florida."
255,2," Both parties agree that at some point, a number of local governments adopted the UFC as law. Neither party, however, 
presented evidence of any specific governmental adoption of the code. The plaintiff did present evidence that public fire officials 
in designated areas routinely enforced the UFC ban on the lining of leaking tanks by denying permits to plaintiff."
255,3, Individuals could also propose code changes.
255,4," However, the UFC Committee meetings were open to the public; and, in theory, any person could object to a proposed code 
change."
255,5," This meeting, like the UFC Committee meeting, was open to the public. While members of the public could not vote on UFC 
changes, they could express support for or opposition to any proposal under consideration. "
256,6," Sessions officials had requested an opportunity to speak before the subcommittee after learning that Robbins, who they knew 
was a competitor opposed to tank lining, was a member of the subcommittee."
256,7," A UL label indicates that a product has been certified as safe by the Underwriters Laboratories testing program. The label 
certifies the safety of the product only when the product is new. At the time Robbins made his misrepresentation concerning the 
""voiding"" of this label, the UL representative on the Article 79 subcommittee was not present. "
257,8," The minutes of the March 18, 1981 meeting read: The committee was unanimous in their disapproval of cutting an opening in a tank and thus destroying the integrity of the UL 
approval to proceed with the lining process. Other problems of external corrosion, loss of structural stability, corrosion of piping, 
etc., were discussed and it was agreed that such lining procedures should be prohibited unless the finished product will meet UL 
approval. Exhibit 28."
257,9," The proposed code change provided: ""Leaking tanks shall be removed from the ground."""
257,10, The minutes indicate that Sessions' officials and Robbins were present at this meeting.
257,11," In adopting the Article 79 subcommittee's recommendation, the WFCA altered the language but not the substance of § 
79.601(d). The 1982 code provision read: ""Leaking tanks shall be promptly emptied and removed from the ground or abandoned 
in accordance with Section 79.113."" Exhibit 137. The WFCA did not keep minutes of its annual meeting."
257,12," The Boatwright Act, effective on January 1, 1983, provided in relevant part that no local agency could deny a permit to repair 
an underground storage tank ""solely on the basis that the tank is to be repaired by an interior-coating process."" Cal. Gov't Code 
§ 53076 (West 1983). The Sher Bill guaranteed the right of a tank-owner to repair a leaking underground tank once ""by an interior-coating process"" 
under certain conditions. Cal. Health & Safety Code § 25284.5 (West 1983). In addition, the Sher Bill provided that the 
legislature intended to ""preempt any local regulations of underground storage tanks."" Cal. Health & Safety Code § 25288.1 
(West 1983). The Sher Bill has since been amended, but the law continues to express the legislative intent to preempt local 
regulation. "
258,13," Plaintiff's complaint included claims for violations of the California Cartwright Act, unfair competition, tortious interference with 
contractual relations, tortious interference with prospective advantage, trade libel, and defamation. Defendant Joor alleged 
counterclaims for violations of the Lanham Act and intentional interference with contractual relations. Before trial, plaintiff 
abandoned its claim under Section 2 of the Sherman Act and its state law claims for defamation, unfair competition, and trade 
libel. Defendant abandoned its counterclaims. Pretrial Order of November 13, 1989. The complaint initially named a second 
defendant. Sessions voluntarily dismissed this defendant in March 1985."
258,14," The Court initially granted summary judgment for defendant as to all of plaintiff's antitrust claims, and dismissed without 
prejudice plaintiff's state law claims. Order of January 17, 1986. The Court, however, subsequently reinstated plaintiff's 
complaint to the extent that it alleged ""refusal to deal"" claims as the Noerr doctrine did not apply to such claims. Order of April 9, 
1986. The Court also reinstated plaintiff's state law claims at that time. Id. In modifying its initial order, the Court did not alter its 
determination that the Noerr doctrine entitled defendant to summary judgment as to those antitrust claims relating to defendant's 
conduct in connection with the WFCA."
258,15," The Ninth Circuit, however, concluded that Joor's alleged misrepresentations to fire officials ""outside of the WFCA lobbying 
process, before the Code was amended"" may have fallen within the ""sham exception"" to Noerr and accordingly remanded on 
this limited issue. Sessions I, 827 F.2d at 468-69. While the Noerr-Pennington issue was pending before the Ninth Circuit, this Court granted summary judgment for the defendant 
as to the refusal to deal claims, see Note 14, supra, and again dismissed without prejudice the pendent state law claims. Order 
of March 23, 1987. Plaintiff appealed this ruling. The Ninth Circuit declined to address the merits of this second appeal, remanding to this Court for reconsideration in light of its 
decision on the Noerr-Pennington issue. Sessions Tank Liners, Inc. v. Joor Mfg., Inc., No. 87-5854 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 14, 1988) 
(""Sessions II""). This Court, in turn, vacated its Order of March 23, 1987. Order of March 21, 1988."
258,16," Prior to trial, defendant Joor again moved for summary judgment, claiming that plaintiff had not presented sufficient evidence 
to support its antitrust claims. The Court denied this motion. Order of August 17, 1989."
258,17," There are two additional state law claims brought by Sessions which require disposition. The California Cartwright Act claim 
does not appear to have been seriously urged as a ground of recovery at trial and, in any event, any damages awarded on this 
theory would duplicate those awarded and trebled under § 1. The claim for tortious interference with contractual relations was 
not proved by Sessions. "
259,18," As Judge Sneed pointed out, the type of analysis adopted by the Second Circuit in Allied requires ""that the antitrust law 
develop the permissible practices of model code associations, their members and participating non-members."" Sessions I, 827 
F.2d at 465."
259,19," In this respect, Allied is contrary to the cases applying the Noerr doctrine to direct efforts to influence legislative action. Where 
a private party petitions a legislative body, courts will refuse to deconstruct the decisionmaking process to ascertain whether the 
legislature's action was truly independent or instead the product of coercion or manipulation by a private party. See City of 
Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 113 L. Ed. 2d 382, 111 S. Ct. 1344 (1991). "
260,20, Not all members of the subcommittee were present for the March 17 vote. 
261,21," Joor contends that Sessions is responsible for any failure on the part of either the WFCA or the UFC subcommittee to review 
proposed § 79.601(d). According to Joor, Sessions should have objected to the proposal in the UFC subcommittee meeting or in 
the subsequent WFCA meeting. The antitrust laws, however, do not impose such an exhaustion of remedies requirement on 
plaintiffs. See Elhauge, supra, at 712-17 (antitrust defendant not entitled to state action defense simply because plaintiff has not 
pursued all state remedies before bringing antitrust claim) (citing cases). "
262,22," HN6[
] Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides that ""every contract, combination . . ., or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. Although this language 
literally prohibits every agreement, or other concerted activity in restraint of trade, courts have long recognized that Congress 
could not have intended this result; and courts have, therefore, interpreted federal antitrust laws to proscribe only unreasonable 
restraints on competition. See Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 1, 65, 55 L. Ed. 619, 31 S. Ct. 502 (1911); Bhan v. 
NME Hosp., Inc., 929 F.2d 1404, 1409 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 60 U.S.L.W. 3295 (U.S. Aug. 29, 1985) (No. 91-575); Los 
Angeles Memorial Coliseum Comm'n v. N.F.L., 726 F.2d 1381, 1387 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 990, 105 S. Ct. 397, 83 L. 
Ed. 2d 331 (1984)."
262,23," Practices which are considered ""illegal per se include horizontal price-fixing, division of markets, and certain tying 
arrangements."" See Bhan, 929 F.2d at 1410."
262,24," In this case, there is no contention that Joor's conduct should be governed by a per se rule."
262,25," A recent Ninth Circuit decision describes the analysis in a slightly different manner. To meet his initial burden in establishing that the practice is an unreasonable restraint of trade, plaintiff must show that the 
activity is the type that restrains trade and that the restraint is likely to be of significant magnitude. . . . . . . . "
263,," Should the plaintiff satisfy his initial burden, the defendant must offer evidence of pro-competitive effects. The plaintiff, driven to 
this point, must then try to show that any legitimate objectives can be achieved in a substantially less restrictive manner. Finally, 
the court must weigh the harms and benefits to determine if the behavior is reasonable on balance. Bhan, 929 F.2d at 1413."
263,26," As Sessions named only Joor as a defendant in this action, it is unnecessary to determine whether any members of the WFCA 
or the Article 79 subcommittee besides those who were present for the March 17, 1981 vote could be held individually liable for 
the antitrust violation. Some decisions suggest that any member of a private association who is aware of illegal action by the 
association and does not protest may be liable under the Sherman Act. See, e.g., Phelps Dodge Ref. Corp. v. FTC, 139 F.2d 
393, 396 (2d Cir. 1943). In more recent cases, courts have held that only members who actively participate in the association's 
illegal act may be liable. See, e.g., Kline v. Coldwell, Banker & Co., 508 F.2d 226, 232 (9th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 
963, 44 L. Ed. 2d 449, 95 S. Ct. 1950 (1975); see also 7 Phillip E. Areeda, Antitrust Law P 1477, at 346 n.12 (1986) 
(suggesting that it is problematic to hold organization's members individually liable). Even under the more restrictive standard, 
members of the Article 79 subcommittee who voted for § 79.601(d) clearly could be held liable under the Sherman Act. These 
subcommittee members knew that Robbins was economically interested in restricting tank lining and knew that the 
subcommittee had not followed procedures to ensure that tank lining would be addressed in an objective manner. Nevertheless, 
they voted to ban tank lining."
263,27," Sessions contends that, in proving that the defendant has failed the Allied test, it has established all of the elements of an 
antitrust violation. The Court rejects this argument. First, the Allied court stated that actions taken by a defendant to influence 
standard-promulgation by a private association, if not protected by Noerr, should be analyzed under the rule of reason. Allied, 
486 U.S. at 500-01, 506-07. Second, plaintiff's argument proceeds on the erroneous assumption that a standard-setting process 
which has been biased by an economically interested participant will necessarily produce standards that have anticompetitive 
effects. In Allied, however, the Court explicitly declined to endorse this assumption, noting that product standards set by private "
264,," associations have a serious potential for anticompetitive harm. Id. at 501. The Supreme Court has cautioned against assuming 
the existence of anticompetitive effects where ""'economic impact . . . is not immediately obvious.'"" Consolidated Metal Prod., Inc. 
v. American Petroleum Inst., 846 F.2d 284, 290 (5th Cir. 1988) (citing FTC v. Indiana Fed. of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 458-59, 90 
L. Ed. 2d 445, 106 S. Ct. 2009 (1986)) (holding that trade association's failure to certify equipment manufactured by plaintiff 
does not necessarily have anticompetitive effects and should not be treated as per se illegal)."
264,28," However, the Allied Court did allude to the procompetitive benefits resulting from the promulgation of safety standards. Allied, 
486 U.S. at 501."
264,29," The parties have stipulated that the alleged restraint on competition operated to adversely affect interstate trade and 
commerce in the business of lining leaking underground storage tanks in the western United States. "
265,30," On this record, the Court could not apply the teaching of City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 113 L. Ed. 2d 
382, 111 S. Ct. 1344 (1991), but also does not find that its application is warranted."
265,31," There are a number of letters in evidence sent by Mr. Robbins to various entities encouraging the prohibition of in-place lining 
of leaking tanks. These letters included four letters sent to the American Petroleum Institute (""API""), a trade organization of oil 
companies which, in turn, were the largest customer groups of both sessions and Joor, in which Robbins advised the API of its 
moral and legal responsibility not to permit tank lining to continue. Similar letters were sent to the Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. 
and the National Fire Protection Association. Later, Robbins also sent letters like these to the County of Sacramento, the City of 
Los Angeles, the City of San Diego and the State of California Water Resources Board."
265,32," The Allied court did not decide whether a party who subverts the standard-setting process could be held liable for damages 
flowing from the adoption of an anticompetitive standard by government officials. In Allied, the Court expressly avoided this 
issue, noting that plaintiff was awarded damages solely ""on the theory 'that the stigma of not obtaining [Code] approval of its "
266,," products and [defendant's] ""marketing"" of that stigma caused independent marketplace harm to [plaintiff] in those jurisdictions 
permitting use of [the products]."" Allied, 486 U.S. at 498 n.2 (citing Indian Head, Inc. v. Allied Tube & Conduit Corp., 817 F.2d 
938, 941 n.3 (2d Cir. 1987), aff'd, 486 U.S. 492, 100 L. Ed. 2d 497, 108 S. Ct. 1931 (1988))."
266,33," As a leading antitrust treatise has noted: Government learns about reality through a complex battle of contending political forces which speak truths and partial truths and 
exert diverse pressures upon various persons and institutions. Society recognizes that politics is often a rough and tumble affair. 
Many would feel, moreover, that definition and balancing are better left to legislatures, which have more political experience than 
the courts and which may be better able to appreciate the balance of contending forces. An antitrust suit may be too limited a 
context for that purpose."
266,1," Areeda & Turner, supra, P 204c, at 47. "
267,34," The Ninth Circuit held that such misrepresentations fell within the sham exception to the Noerr doctrine. Sessions I, 827 F.2d 
at 465 n.5. In Allied, the Court explained that the sham exception to Noerr did not encompass this type of conduct. Allied, 486 
U.S. at 508 n.10. ""A 'sham' situation involves a defendant whose activities are 'not genuinely aimed at procuring favorable 
government action' at all, not one 'who ""genuinely seeks to achieve his governmental result, but does so through improper 
means.""'"" Omni, 111 S. Ct. at 1354 (citations omitted). The Allied Court, while it objected to the Ninth Circuit's label, did not 
question its reasoning."
267,35," The conclusion reached here is also supported by City of Long Beach v. Standard Oil Co., 872 F.2d 1401 (9th Cir. 1989), 
amended by 886 F.2d 246 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1076, 110 S. Ct. 1126, 107 L. Ed. 2d 1032 (1990). In City of Long 
Beach, the plaintiff city filed an antitrust action against six major oil companies, alleging that the companies conspired to fix and 
maintain uniform, noncompetitive posted prices for crude oil produced from a field owned by the city. The district court granted 
summary judgment for the defendants on the ground that the federal government, which had established a federal price control 
program for crude oil, was the legal cause of any injury to the city. The Ninth Circuit reversed, stating that the federal program 
would not be a supervening cause of plaintiff's injury if plaintiff could show that the federal government would have set price 
ceilings at a higher level in the absence of the alleged conspiracy. Id. at 1408-09. The establishment of price ceilings by the federal government, after the alleged conspiracy began, does not in itself mean that 
the companies' conduct could not have caused the injuries. . . . If the [federal] price ceilings were based on prices set artificially 
low as a result of an unlawful conspiracy, liability should still exist. . . . Mere ratification by government officials does not absolve 
an otherwise illegal conspiracy. Id. "
268,36," All damages, however, must be traceable to an injury that was, in fact, caused by the defendant. MCI Communications Corp. 
v. American Tel. & Tel., 708 F.2d 1081, 1168 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 891, 78 L. Ed. 2d 226, 104 S. Ct. 234 (1983)."
268,37," The plaintiff's damage study, Exhibit 308, covers fiscal years 1981-1988. The calculation for the first year of the damage study 
is not based on the same theory as the subsequent years, but rather on the number of permits denied in California. A small 
number of these denials occurred before March 17, 1981. Nevertheless, the Court finds an award of damages for the first year is 
justified based on all of the evidence, including that of Joor's activities prior to the March 17, 1981 meeting. "
269,38," ""It is the intentional attainment of an unjust advantage which underlies the requirement that the interference be improper. . . ."" 
DeVoto v. Pacific Fidelity Life Ins. Co., 618 F.2d 1340, 1348 (1980)."
269,39," It is not clear under the California law of tortious interference whether damages can be awarded for the loss of net profit to be 
derived from potential business with unspecified customers. Rickards v. Canine Eye Registration Found., Inc., 704 F.2d 1449 
(9th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 994, 78 L. Ed. 2d 683, 104 S. Ct. 488 (1983); In Re Super Premium Ice Cream Distribution 
Antitrust Litig., 691 F. Supp. 1262, 1271 (N.D. Cal. 1988), aff'd mem. sub nom. Haagan-Daz Co. v. Double Rainbow Gourmet 
Ice Creams, Inc., 895 F.2d 1417 (9th Cir. 1990). However, in a situation where the plaintiff's established concern competes with 
the defendant and is put out of business by the defendant's wrongful conduct, there should be ""a limit to the exactness the 
defendant can demand"" in proving damages.  Independence Tube Corp. v. Copperweld Corp., 691 F.2d 310, 329 (7th Cir. 
1982), rev'd on other grounds, 467 U.S. 752, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984)."
269,40," The problem of duplication of damages in cases involving both antitrust and tort claims has been addressed by a number of 
district courts. See Independence Tube Corp. v. Copperweld Corp., 691 F.2d 310, 327 (7th Cir. 1982). "
276,*," Honorable David Sam, United States District Court for the District of Utah, sitting by designation. "
277,1," The individual defendants are as follows, with their area of medical specialty as indicated: Leroy Milton, M.D. (internal 
medicine); George Brown, M.D. (general surgery); William Blanchard, M.D. (general surgery); Samuel Dakil, M.D. (ear, nose and 
throat); John Cotton, M.D. (family practice); Steven Atwood, M.D. (internal medicine/emergency medicine); Charles Holland, 
M.D. (internal medicine); Karl Sauer, M.D. (general surgery); Joe McCauley, M.D. (family practice); and Don Schuller, M.D. 
(radiology). Defendants Milton, Brown, Blanchard, Dakil, Cotton, Atwood and Holland were members of the Clinic. Additionally, 
Milton and Holland were both members of the Hospital's Board of Trustees during the time relevant to this case. In May 1984, 
Milton became ""Chief of Staff"" at the Hospital. Defendants Sauer, Schaff, McCauley and Schuller were not affiliated with the 
Clinic. Plaintiffs named as non-defendant co-conspirators four other doctors who practice at the Hospital. "
278,2, Defendants do not appear in this appeal to argue they are entitled to state action immunity.
278,3," There is a pending motion to dismiss the cross-appeal for failure to file it timely. The facts relating to this motion are as follows: 
Under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(3) the notice of cross-appeal was due on June 19, 1989. In fact, it was filed on June 20. Upon 
learning that it had been filed late, defendants/cross-appellants filed a motion for extension of time in which to file the notice. 
Included was an affidavit from defendants' counsel, which stated that the notice had been mailed to Muskogee, Oklahoma from 
Tulsa, Oklahoma on June 16, and that in counsel's experience mail between those two cities took at most two days. Defendants 
also relied upon Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5), asserting that their late filing was due to ""excusable neglect."" Plaintiffs/cross-appellees 
filed a response arguing that the ""excusable neglect"" standard had not been met in this case and defendants filed a reply. The 
district court granted defendants' motion for an extension of time, applying it nunc pro tunc to the notice of appeal filed June 20. 
We review that conclusion only for a clear abuse of discretion. See Harris Truck Lines, Inc. v. Cherry Meat Packers, Inc., 371 
U.S. 215, 9 L. Ed. 2d 261 , 83 S. Ct. 283 (1962); Romero v. Peterson, 930 F.2d 1502, 1505 (10th Cir. 1991). "
279,," Plaintiffs/cross-appellees first argue that the district court applied the wrong standard by inquiring whether defendants 
demonstrated ""good cause"" rather than ""excusable neglect."" We disagree. An examination of the district court's order makes it 
clear that the court applied the ""excusable neglect"" rather than the ""good cause"" standard. More importantly, the motion to dismiss requires us to decide whether the district court properly found excusable neglect in the 
circumstances of this case. Noting the broad discretion granted the district court in making that determination, we deny the 
motion to dismiss the cross-appeal. In denying the motion, however, we remind the parties that we would still consider the issue 
raised in the cross-appeal--whether defendants had any immunity from the application of the antitrust laws--because defendants 
may raise any ground for upholding the favorable judgment they received below. See In re Robinson, 921 F.2d 252, 253 (10th 
Cir. 1990); Koch v. City of Hutchinson, 847 F.2d 1436, 1441 n.14 (10th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 909, 102 L. Ed. 2d 
250 , 109 S. Ct. 262 (1988)."
279,4," The list of other types of units entitled to immunity actually comes from the House Report on the predecessor bill to the Act, 
which had defined ""local government"" as a ""city, county, parish, town, township, village, school district, sanitary district, or any 
other general or special purpose political subdivision of one or more States."" "
280,5," See Sweeney v. Athens Regional Medical Ctr., 705 F. Supp. 1556, 1561-62 (M.D. Ga. 1989); Griffith v. Health Care Auth. of 
the City of Huntsville, 705 F. Supp. 1489, 1501 (N.D. Ala. 1989); Wicker v. Union County General Hosp., 673 F. Supp. 177, 186 
(N.D. Miss. 1987); Palm Springs Medical Clinic, Inc. v. Desert Hosp., 628 F. Supp. 454, 456-57 (C.D. Cal. 1986)."
280,6," The Hospital was formed as a trust for furtherance of public functions under 60 Okla. Stat. 176-180. The City of McAlester 
owns the land upon which the Hospital is located and leases it to the Hospital. Its trustees are public officers, appointed by the 
mayor of McAlester, and they must take the oath of office required of elected public officials. 60 Okla. Stat. 178(a). Meetings of 
the trustees are subject to the open meeting laws like other public boards and commissions. Id. at 178(c). The Declaration of 
Trust which created the Hospital stated that the Hospital was created for the benefit of the city of McAlester and that the purpose 
of the trust was to provide hospital and public health services to the residents of McAlester. Defendants' Ex. 155D, Addendum of 
Appellees/Cross-Appellants at Tab D. However, as the district court noted, a public trust in Oklahoma is a separate legal entity 
from its beneficiary. See State v. Garrison, 348 P.2d 859, 863 (Okla. 1959). Hospital employees are not city employees. Further, 
as the district court also noted, 60 Okla. Stat. 179 makes it clear that any judgment against the Hospital would be satisfied out of 
the trust estate, and the beneficiary (the city of McAlester) would not be liable. Defendants also argue that in Dr. Tarabishi's section 1983 action against the Hospital and its trustees arising out of the same 
facts, this court held that the Hospital and its trustees were acting under color of state law for section 1983 purposes.  Tarabishi 
v. McAlester Regional Hosp., 827 F.2d 648, 652 (10th Cir. 1987). That determination is not, however, dispositive of whether the 
actions of the Hospital and its trustees are entitled to immunity as those of a special function governmental unit and its officials 
or employees. Cf.  Ezpeleta v. Sisters of Mercy Health Corp., 800 F.2d 119, 122 (7th Cir. 1986) (per curiam) (even though 
antitrust claim is barred by state action doctrine, section 1983 claim is unavailable because there is no state action in decision to 
terminate physician's staff privileges)."
280,7, Immunity under the LGAA was apparently not an issue in Buckley. 
281,8," We note that recently, however, the Ninth Circuit has ruled that a hospital district is not immune under the state action doctrine, 
without specifically discussing immunity under the LGAA.  Lancaster Comm. Hosp. v. Antelope Valley Hosp. Dist., 940 F.2d 397 
(9th Cir. 1991)."
281,9," Under the applicable Georgia law, the authority ""operates as a not-for-profit public corporation and is 'deemed to exercise 
public and essential governmental functions and shall have all the powers necessary or convenient to carry out and effectuate 
the purposes and provisions of [the Hospital Authorities Law].'"" Sweeney, 705 F. Supp. at 1561 (quoting Ga. Code Ann. 31-7-75, 
77 (1985))."
281,10," The health care authority was established pursuant to the Health Care Authorities Act of 1982, Ala. Code 22-21-310, et seq., 
which provided, inter alia, that such authorities ""act[] as an agency or instrumentality of its authorizing subdivisions and as a 
political subdivision of the state."" Ala. Code 22-21-318(c)(2)."
281,11," The court held ""the Hospital and its board [of trustees] are themselves governmental agencies. The trustees on the board are 
appointed to limited terms by elected representatives of the people."" Wicker, 673 F. Supp. at 186. "
282,12," In their Complaint and Amended Complaint, plaintiffs appeared to charge the Hospital with attempted monopolization as well. 
The district court did not address such a claim in its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and plaintiffs do not appear to 
pursue it in their appellate briefs. "
283,13," The district court stated ""the mere words of the plaintiffs' market definition denote more than the provision of a hospital bed."" 
District Court Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law at 25. The district court also concluded that Dr. Tarabishi, as a provider of 
surgery or surgical services to his patients, was neither a competing provider nor a consumer of ""surgical health care services."" 
Similarly, the court concluded that TMD was neither a competitor nor a consumer in the market of surgical health care services, 
because TMD did not have beds, the measure by which the Hospital's market share in the surgical health care services market 
was determined."
283,14," As indicated, plaintiffs argue mightily that the ""essential facilities"" doctrine was violated in this case. This court explored that 
doctrine in McKenzie v. Mercy Hosp. of Independence, 854 F.2d 365, 369 (10th Cir. 1988): Though the Supreme Court first employed the essential facilities doctrine to condemn the conduct of multiple defendants under 
Section 1 of the Sherman Act, the doctrine has since been applied in cases brought under Section 2 and in which only a single 
entity controls the necessary facility. . . . More recently, the federal courts of appeals have adopted standards to determine whether a monopolist's refusal to deal 
constitutes a violation of the essential facility doctrine under Section 2. In MCI Communications Corp. v. American Tel. and Tel. 
Co., 708 F.2d 1081, 1132-33 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 891, 78 L. Ed. 2d 226 , 104 S. Ct. 234 (1983), the court held that 
to establish liability under the doctrine, the plaintiff must show: ""(1) control of the essential facility by a monopolist; (2) a 
competitor's inability practically or reasonably to duplicate the facility; (3) the denial of the use of the essential facility to a 
competitor; and (4) the feasibility of providing the facility."" Id. at 369 (citations omitted). This court went on to note, however, that a district court had ""declared that for public policy 
reasons, HN10[
] 'the essential facilities doctrine is inapplicable to hospital staff privileges decisions.'"" Id. at 371 n.12 (quoting Pontius v. Children's Hosp., 552 F. Supp. 1352, 1370 (W.D. Pa. 1982)). See also Castelli v. Meadville Medical Ctr., 702 F. Supp. 
1201, 1209 (W.D. Pa. 1988), aff'd, 872 F.2d 411 (3d Cir. 1989) (""This court is in full agreement with the consistent decisions of 
other courts not to apply the essential facilities doctrine to exclusive service contracts by hospitals.""). The McKenzie court did not 
address that issue because it concluded that, even if the doctrine were to apply, the plaintiff had failed to show that he was 
denied access to an essential facility. Were we to apply the doctrine to this denial of staff privileges case, we would hold that it fails as a section two claim because 
plaintiffs failed to establish that the Hospital or any other defendant is a monopolist. To the extent plaintiffs argue the defendants 
conspired to deny them access to an essential facility in violation of section one, we would hold, as this court did in McKenzie, 
that plaintiffs were not denied an essential facility. If we analyze the two plaintiffs separately, plaintiffs' failure to prove an essential facility becomes clearer. Plaintiffs themselves 
assert that it was the TMD Center which was the alleged primary competitive threat to defendants. For the TMD Center, 
however, Dr. Tarabishi's access to Hospital facilities was not essential, because in November 1984 the TMD Center and the 
Hospital entered into a transfer agreement pursuant to which TMD patients had access to the Hospital. As for Dr. Tarabishi 
himself, his argument that he was denied an essential facility proves too much, for it amounts to an argument that a hospital can 
never deny a physician staff privileges, because restricting the practice of that physician always, in some sense, reduces 
competition. Yet Dr. Tarabishi has not proved that restricting his own access to the Hospital, apart from the TMD Center, 
diminished competition in a meaningful antitrust sense. "
284,15," Plaintiffs make a multi-pronged attack on the district court's conclusions with respect to market definition. It is difficult to 
respond to all aspects of this attack, because many of them are obscure. Suffice it to say that we bear in mind that it is plaintiffs' 
burden to prove relevant markets. Thus, plaintiffs' attack on defendants for ""failing to show why medical care consumers from 
Pittsburgh County may sometimes travel to other locations"" is beside the point. Further, proof of markets is required so that 
adverse impact on competition can be evaluated. Thus, plaintiffs' markets must bear some relation to plaintiffs' theory of harm to 
competition. Plaintiffs in this case have failed in that respect. Plaintiffs belatedly attempt to remedy their failure to plead and prove relevant markets by citing FTC v. Indiana Fed'n of Dentists, 
476 U.S. 447, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 , 106 S. Ct. 2009 (1986), where the Supreme Court stated, HN12[
] ""'proof of actual 
detrimental effects, such as a reduction of output' can obviate the need for an inquiry into market power, which is but a 
'surrogate for detrimental effects.'"" Id. at 460-61 (quoting Areeda & Turner, Antitrust Law, 1/21511 (1986)); see also Bhan v. 
NME Hosp., Inc., 929 F.2d 1404, 1413 n.10 (9th Cir. 1991); Reazin v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 899 F.2d 951, 968 n.24 (10th 
Cir.), cert. denied, 111 L. Ed. 2d 752, 110 S. Ct. 3241 (1990). What plaintiffs fail to realize, however, is that the ""proof of actual 
detrimental effects"" requires more than the simple allegation that the closure of TMD and the cessation of Dr. Tarabishi's 
practice reduced competition. As we have explained previously, what plaintiffs have never shown is that consumer choices were 
in fact reduced or impaired by the denial of staff privileges to Dr. Tarabishi. See n.14, supra."
284,16," Indeed, as defendants point out, what evidence there was on this point suggests the opposite conclusion. At the same time Dr. 
Tarabishi left the Clinic, another doctor also left and set up an independent practice as an internist/cardiologist in competition 
with the Clinic. His independent practice was very successful. "
285,17," Plaintiffs do not seriously dispute that defendants' activities in the Certificate of Need application hearings were protected 
under the Noerr/Pennington doctrine. See United Mine Workers v. Pennington; 381 U.S. 657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 , 85 S. Ct. 1585 
(1965); Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 , 81 S. Ct. 523 (1961)."
285,18," In doing so, the court relied on Weiss v. York Hosp., 745 F.2d 786 (3d Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1060 , 105 S.Ct. 
1777, 84 L.Ed.2d 836 (1985), in which the court applied the per se rule to a contention that a hospital's refusal to grant staff 
privileges to osteopathic physicians constituted a boycott or concerted refusal to deal. The Weiss court noted, however, that: "
286,," The Medical Staff is, however, entitled to exclude individual doctors, including osteopaths, on the basis of their lack of 
professional competence or unprofessional conduct. If York's policy toward D.O.'s could be viewed as a form of industry self-
regulation of this type, the rule of reason, rather than a per se rule, would be applicable. Id. at 820 (citation omitted); see also Miller v. Indiana Hosp., 843 F.2d 139, 144 n.6 (3d Cir.) (""in a hospital staff privilege case in 
which the hospital defends on lack of professional ability, the rule of reason test would apply""), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 870, 102 L. 
Ed. 2d 147 , 109 S. Ct. 178 (1988). Because defendants in this case terminated Dr. Tarabishi's staff privileges at least 
ostensibly because of a lack of professional competence or unprofessional conduct, we agree with the district court that Weiss 
does not dictate the use of per se analysis."
286,19," The district court similarly rejected per se treatment of plaintiffs' conspiracy to stabilize prices claim. We affirm, and we further 
affirm the district court's conclusion that there was ""no evidence of such a price stabilization conspiracy, whether directly or 
through the effect of the peer review proceedings."" District Court Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law at 40."
286,20," The district court noted that ""the only impact upon competition, as distinguished from plaintiffs, is based upon the speculation 
that TMD would ultimately become a hospital. The Court finds this speculation to be tenuous."" District Court Findings of Fact and 
Conclusions of Law at 39. While it is true that there was an area -- the provision of out-patient surgery -- in which the Hospital 
arguably did compete with TMD, plaintiffs never quantified the impact on competition in that market. "
289,1," Polaris' contention that the distributorship termination merely reflected Polaris' refusal to acquiesce in Western's attempt to 
evade its voluntary contractual obligation to purchase the ATVs simply raises a question for the jury.  This factual dispute 
illustrates why the grant of summary judgment was improper."
289,2," Neither Polaris nor Western challenges the district court's determination that the tying arrangement affected a substantial 
volume of commerce in ATVs, the tied product. "
290,3," Summary judgment of the unreasonable restraint of trade claim was also inappropriate because establishing the relevant 
market is critical to the rule of reason analysis.  Oltz, 861 F.2d at 1446. As we have said, there was a genuine issue of material 
fact as to the relevant market. "
293,1," On October 2, 1991, we ordered appellees to designate the specific portions of the record that they contend should remain 
under seal. They responded with an exhaustive list on October 8, 1991, the disposition of which would take longer to decide than 
the merits of the appeal. Accordingly, in our opinion we have tried in the main to avoid specific references to items on the list 
without in any way suggesting that they are entitled to remain under seal. We leave for the district court the inquiry as to the 
merits of appellees' contentions for confidentiality of particular items. "
294,2," The record indicates only that the application was submitted in September, 1989."
294,3," Appellee Edward J. Hinman, M.D., M.P.H., was a principal advocate for termination of appellant's membership and privileges at 
Greater Southeast; appellant has alleged that Dr. Hinman caused the Hospital to terminate its contract with him. "
295,4," The Hearing Officer was originally named as a defendant in this suit. By order of December 11, 1990, the district court granted 
his motion to dismiss, finding that he was immune from suit pursuant to the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986. 
Johnson v. Greater Southeast Community Hosp. Corp., No. 90-1992, Memorandum Opinion (D.D.C. Dec. 11, 1990). The district 
court's order was summarily affirmed by a panel of this court on April 5, 1991. Johnson v. Greater Southeast Community Hosp. 
Corp., No. 91-7002 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 5, 1991) (Order)."
295,5," See D.C. Code Ann. §§ 28-4502, 28-4503 (1981)."
295,6, See infra note 9. 
297,7," At oral argument, appellant renewed his assertion that his Medical Staff membership and privileges expired by operation of law 
when the Hospital failed to grant or deny his application for reappointment to the Medical Staff within the 120-day period 
prescribed by D.C. Code Ann. § 32-1307(f) (1981). Appellant made this argument to the district court in opposing appellees' 
Motion for Dismissal and/or Summary Judgment, but the district court did not address it in its memorandum opinion. On remand, 
the district court should consider what effect, if any, this statutory provision has on appellant's Medical Staff membership and 
privileges at the Hospital."
297,8," In remanding for further fact-finding on the termination question, we are not suggesting that a party alleging violations of the 
antitrust laws necessarily must await elimination from the market before bringing a private cause of action under the Clayton Act. 
See Brief for Appellant at 27-28; Reply Brief for Appellant at 8. We are merely saying that in order HN2[
] to make out a private 
cause of action for damages under § 4 of the Clayton Act, a party must allege injury to business or property resulting from a 
violation of the antitrust laws. See 15 U.S.C. § 15 (1988). A party ""threatened"" with injury that has yet to materialize does, 
however, have an injunctive remedy under the Clayton Act. See 15 U.S.C. § 26 (1988) (injunctive relief available when a party is 
""threatened [with] loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws""); see also Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 
395 U.S. 100, 130, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129 , 89 S. Ct. 1562 , 161 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 577 (1969). Appellant, however, did not plead the 
""threat"" of injury; he claimed that he had been terminated and was therefore entitled to treble damages under the antitrust laws."
297,9," Appellant also alleges antitrust injury stemming from: the Hospital's refusal to process his application for reappointment, his 
removal from the Hospital's Call Schedule, and appellees' defamatory remarks to others about his skills. "
298,, We of course reach no conclusion as to the merits of these or any of appellant's claims.
298,10," We find no error, however, in the district court's finding that appellant has failed to allege or demonstrate any economic harm 
to his practice stemming from the terms of the monitoring and supervision agreement. A demographics study submitted to the 
district court shows a drop in appellant's admissions to Greater Southeast, but does not support any inference that the reduction 
was the result of the monitoring and supervision agreement. In fact, Dr. Johnson testified before the Hearing Officer that the 
Hospital had assigned three physicians to monitor him ""because of the number of patients that I was admitting to . . . [the] . . . 
hospital,"" Transcript of Medical Adjudication Hearing (Mar. 22, 1990) at 27, suggesting that appellant's practice was not 
suffering. Also, the President of the Hospital stated, by affidavit, that appellant had never advised him of a single instance in 
which he had sought to admit a patient to the Hospital and admission had been denied. Declaration of Thomas W. Chapman, 
attached as Exhibit 1 to Motion of Defendants to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment (filed Sept. 28, 1990) at 
17."
298,11," Even though the monitoring and supervision agreement did not cause antitrust injury to appellant's practice, see supra note 
10, it did impose severe constraints on his practice. And of course, there is no comparable requirement under the civil rights 
laws that one need allege or demonstrate pecuniary injury in order to seek redress of allegedly illegal racial discrimination. See, 
e.g., Tillman v. Wheaton-Haven Recreation Ass'n, 410 U.S. 431, 434, 35 L. Ed. 2d 403 , 93 S. Ct. 1090 (1973) (§ 1981 suit for 
damages and injunctive relief alleging racial discrimination in the membership policy of a community pool); Clayton v. White Hall 
School Dist., 875 F.2d 676, 679 (8th Cir. 1989) (""Title VII . . . is to be accorded a liberal construction in order to carry out the 
purpose of Congress to eliminate the inconvenience, unfairness and humiliation of racial discrimination"") (internal quotation "
299,," omitted)); Gray v. Greyhound Lines, East, 178 App. D.C. 91, 545 F.2d 169, 176 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (claim of discriminatory 
treatment in the workplace is ""clearly within the scope of Title VII's protection against discrimination in the terms, conditions, or 
privileges of employment"")."
299,12," Cf.  Johnson v. City of Columbia, S.C., Nos. 89-1554, 90-1401, 1991 WL 231298 (4th Cir. Nov. 12, 1991) (en banc) (fire 
fighter did not ""voluntarily"" agree to terms of employment agreement where City improperly threatened him with termination if he 
did not sign agreement)."
299,13, See supra note 11. 
300,14," These factors include: (1) the need for public access to the documents at issue; (2) the extent to which the public had access 
to the documents prior to the sealing order; (3) the fact that a party has objected to disclosure and the identity of that party; (4) 
the strength of the property and privacy interests involved; (5) the possibility of prejudice to those opposing disclosure; and (6) 
the purposes for which the documents were introduced. See Hubbard, 650 F.2d at 317-22."
300,15," Cf.  Stone v. University of Maryland Medical Sys. Corp., No. 89-1023, 1991 WL 219426, at 2-3 (4th Cir. Oct. 31, 1991) (Ervin, 
C.J.) (reversing trial judge's sealing of peer review materials in suit by physician against hospital; rejecting notion that ""once . . . 
medical records are properly subjected to pretrial discovery and may be admitted in evidence in the course of a civil action, that 
somehow, except as between the parties . . ., they remain insulated from public exposure for all other purposes""). "
301,16," Counsel for appellant suggested at oral argument that the broad sealing order, by denying access to the medical records that 
appellant believes demonstrates the lack of merit of Greater Southeast's charges against him, has interfered with his ability to 
gain membership and privileges at other hospitals. "
328,1," Pursuant to Local Rule 20(g), ""Motions for reconsideration or reargument shall be served within ten (10) days after the entry of 
the judgment, order, or decree concerned."" In this case the Order concerned was entered September 19, 1991. Plaintiff did not 
file its motion for reconsideration until October 23, 1991. Thus, the motion is untimely and may be denied on that ground alone. 
Nevertheless, the Court shall address the substance of plaintiff's motion. "
329,2," The Eleventh Circuit has reached the opposite decision. See, United States v. Hartley, 678 F.2d 961-989-90 (11th Cir. 1982), 
cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1170, 1183 (1983)."
329,3," See, K. Brody, 1 Rico In Business and Commercial Litigation, § 3-25 (1990)."
329,4," The plaintiff argues that Petro-Tech provides clear precedent in this circuit for the proposition that ""a RICO enterprise could 
consist of an association in fact of a corporation and its employees."" (Plaintiff's Memorandum at 4 n.3).  Moreover, plaintiff 
argues that ""The Third Circuit in Mobil did not overrule these prior precedents; it merely held that a corporation cannot be held 
liable as a RICO person when it was used as the vehicle for perpetrating the racketeering acts."" Id. Plaintiff's counsel apparently is unaware that the Third Circuit expressly limited Petro-Tech, which involved a motion to dismiss, 
to the proposition that ""the allegation was permissible under our liberal pleading requirements."" Mobil 943 F.2d at 302. "
330,5," Plaintiff's Counsel emphatically states that ""Mobil stands for the singular proposition that § 1962(c) is intended to punish the 
infiltrating criminals (or RICO persons) rather than the legitimate corporation which might be an innocent victim."" (Plaintiff's 
Memorandum at 7). This interpretation of Mobil ignores the bulk of the opinion. The Third Circuit states its view of the import of 
Mobil, noting that, ""Our decision is in accord with numerous courts that have rejected attempts to circumvent the distinctiveness 
requirement by alleging enterprises that are merely combinations of individuals or entities affiliated with a defendant 
corporation."" Id. at 301. "
332,6," Defendants Fern Rosen and Theresa Carr join in this portion of the plaintiff's motion arguing that Rosen and Carr have 
asserted a cross-claim for contribution and indemnity against PCS."
332,7, Pendent and ancillary jurisdiction were replaced by supplemental jurisdiction in the 1990 amendment to § 1367.

without prejudice to the right of the parties to take further testimony. . . . "
343,3," HN6[
] We apply Sixth Circuit law on review of the district court's rulings on Rule 11 and other matters not within the Federal Circuit's exclusive purview. See Atari, Inc. v. JS & A Group, Inc., 747 F.2d at 1438-40, 223 USPQ at 1086-87. "
346,4," Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2, prohibits monopolization or attempts to monopolize: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a 
felony . . . . Section 4(a) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15(a), provides for civil action for treble damages for violation of the antitrust laws. "
348,5, Brennan was awarded a patent although the PTO found that Brennan was not the first inventor of the subject matter. 
357,1," Prior to trial, the district court dismissed the individual defendants, who were employees of either Ford Motor Company or Ford 
Motor Credit Company and the jury returned a verdict in favor of the remaining individual defendant, John S. Wenner. Moreover, 
the district court granted judgment n.o.v. in favor of the defendants on their motions to dismiss the individual plaintiffs, Richard N. 
de la Rigaudiere and David C. Smith. "
360,2," Count I alleged a per se violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act based on a horizontal conspiracy to allocate markets. Count 
II alleged that the franchise agreement between Tunis Brothers and Ford Motor was a contract in restraint of trade in violation of 
section 1 of the Sherman Act. Count III alleged the same conduct as count I denominated as ""dirty business tricks."" Count VI 
alleged that Ford Motor breached the franchise contract between the parties. "
363,3," Although du Pont and Mogul involved section 2 of the Sherman Act, we believe that the analyses employed in those cases in 
defining a relative product market are instructive in this section 1 case. We are cognizant that in Columbia Metal Culvert Co. v. Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp., 579 F.2d 20, 27 n.11 (3d Cir.), cert. 
denied, 439 U.S. 876, 58 L. Ed. 2d 190 , 99 S. Ct. 214 (1978), we intimated that ""the inquiries into the scope of competition 
under § 1 and § 2 are not precisely the same."" See also Martin B. Glauser Dodge Co., 570 F.2d at 81-82 n.17 (declining to 
address whether the relevant product market, as defined in cases involving section 2 claims, would also apply to section 1 
cases). On this record, however, the plaintiffs do not present a sufficiently close factual issue to demarcate a distinction between 
product market definitions in section 1 and section 2 cases where there is simply no evidence of a Ford only tractor market. We 
are not confronted with a gray zone where ""rival products might provide sufficient competition to foreclose a finding of 
monopolization, yet the degree of insularity of the initial product might allow a finding of illegal restraint of trade in regard to 
restrictions imposed within that initial market."" Columbia Metal, 578 F.2d at 27 n.11. "
367,4," However, inconsistent with Tunis I, in which we indicated that the plaintiffs had not pursued their claim that Ford Motor and its 
wholly-owned subsidiary Ford Credit had conspired in violation of the antitrust law, 763 F.2d at 1495 & n.20, the plaintiffs did 
pursue this theory at trial. The plaintiffs even stipulated that Ford Credit is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ford Motor. We need not 
here apply Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 , 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984), which held 
that a parent and its wholly-owned subsidiary were ""incapable of conspiring with each other for the purposes of § 1 of the 
Sherman Act,"" to determine whether either Ford Credit or Wenner Ford could have been capable of conspiring with Ford Motor. 
Because the relationship between Wenner Ford and Ford Motor differs, for Sherman Act conspiracy purposes, from the 
Copperweld or Ford Motor/Ford Credit relationship, we decline to consider where, as here, the plaintiffs were unable to establish 
antitrust liability."
367,5," In Matsushita, the Court reversed a grant of summary judgment for the plaintiffs, reasoning that the evidence did not rule out 
the possibility that the allegedly conspiratorial conduct of the defendants was consistent with legitimate business interests.  475 
U.S. 597-98, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538. The Court thus held that the plaintiffs had failed to prove the lack of a genuine 
issue of material fact to prevail on the motion for summary judgment. Relying upon Matsushita, the Ford defendants requested that the district court instruct the jury that in order for Tunis Brothers to 
prevail, the jury must find that they had a motive to conspire in violation of the antitrust laws and that they acted inconsistently 
with their economic interests. The district court gave to the jury a standard antitrust conspiracy charge and denied the Ford 
defendants' motion ""to the extent [the standard instructions] fail to incorporate the defendants' requested instruction on motive."" 
District Court Memorandum Opinion Typescript at 14 n.3. "
369,6," Ford differentiates between a ""company store,"" entirely owned and operated by Ford, and a dealer development franchise such 
as Wenner's into which Ford infuses capital to struggling dealerships in exchange for all the voting stock and a large majority of 
the equity ownership of the company. The avowed purpose of the dealer development program is to assist struggling 
dealerships temporarily and then to promote gradual repurchase of the equity by the franchise holder. For a general description 
of these arrangements, and certain antitrust consequences, see Martin B. Glauser Dodge Co. v. Chrysler Corp., 570 F.2d 72 (3d 
Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 913, 56 L. Ed. 2d 413 , 98 S. Ct. 2253 (1978). "
371,7," All three Ford defendants contend that the plaintiffs altered their compensatory damage claim midway through the damages 
portion of the trial when confronted with inaccuracies in the underlying data. Further, they claim that no documentation was 
provided to them for the revised damage claim. In addition, the Ford defendants challenge the notice, as late as mid-December 
of 1989, that Dr. Samuel J. Kursh would appear as an expert witness for the plaintiffs. Although successful in precluding Kursh's 
testimony at the damages trial because of this late notice and the cumulative nature of Kursh's testimony, Tunis Brothers has 
appealed that ruling. Should Tunis Brothers be able to satisfy the district court on remand that Kursh's testimony is not 
cumulative, and we express no opinion as to whether this will be possible, we are confident that the plaintiffs will provide 
adequate notice that Kursh will be testifying. "
372,8," Tunis Brothers did continue to buy Ford parts from other franchises during 1981; however, they made less profit on these items 
and it is not contended that these ought to be included in the 1981 projection as franchise related profits."
372,9," The plaintiffs planned to open a Ford franchise in Cochranville but also planned to maintain the Tunis Brothers' Kennett Square 
location for service and hardware sales. They failed, however, to provide evidence of damages for the loss of a Cochranville 
franchise. In this connection, a November 16, 1981, letter from Fraher to Smith, which indicated that ""[Ford has] no problem with 
you relocating to Cochranville . . . . When you locate a building please let us know so that we can look at it,"" combined with the 
plaintiffs' own testimony, suggests that they declined further to pursue a Ford franchise. Thus their expert, Oxman, lacked the 
requisite foundation to testify that even if the Kennett Square franchise was conditional upon moving to Cochranville in two to 
three years, the termination of the franchise resulted in losses to the Kennett Square location regardless of costs associated with 
a Cochranville location. "
373,10," De la Rigaudiere and Smith had planned to increase Tunis Brothers' Ford tractor sales in three different ways. First, de la 
Rigaudiere planned to pursue 50 percent of the Ford tractor sales at the Kennett Square location. Second, David Smith would 
have made 25 percent of their Ford tractor sales while visiting farms in connection with Fert-L Soil sales. For these sales, Smith 
would not receive a commission, nor would his salary from Tunis Brothers have been increased. The last 25 percent of Tunis 
Brothers Ford tractor sales would have been pursued by other Fert-L Soil salesman, who would have received a four percent 
commission on their Ford tractor sales, estimated to total approximately $ 8,800 per year. Other than these commissions, no 
additional costs were attributed to Tunis Brothers for the Fert-L Soil salesmen because Fert-L Soil, Smith's family owned and 
operated business, would have borne those costs."
373,11," For 1975, Tunis Brothers's net profit was reflected in its corporate tax return as $ 5,346.57, for 1976 as $ 383.10, for 1977 as $ 
16,358.93, for 1978 as $ 347.72, for 1979 as $ 1,393.00, and for 1980 as $ 1632.04. "
375,12," Although the plaintiffs attribute that failure to the unsuitability of the Allis-Chalmers tractor to mushroom growers, whether their 
failure with that line is justified by the difference between Allis-Chalmers and Ford tractors is a factual issue particularly suited to 
a jury's resolution. "
376,13," We are also quite troubled by the grossly improper remarks of the plaintiffs' counsel during his closing argument at the close of 
the damages case. Frustrated by the district court's exclusion of much of the plaintiffs' evidence of damages, concerning non-
tractor Ford sales, service or hardware sales, and the closing remarks of Ford Motor's counsel, the plaintiffs' counsel argued to 
the jury: I ask you, I beg you, give us as much in damages as the Judge will permit you to give us. And then -- and then it is going to be 
within your discretion, in the fraud case, to give us as large an amount of punitive damages -- and I can't tell you what to add and 
I can't tell you what to multiply, but I ask you to give us as much punitive damages to make up for our inability to receive 
compensation for all of the nontractor Ford sales, half of the total sales of this company projected to 10 years, to make up for 
what we can§'t get. (Emphasis added). Although requested by Ford Motor, the district court did not give a curative instruction on this point. Given the disproportionate 
size of the punitive damage award as compared to the compensatory damage award, we are unable to conclude decisively that "
377,," the jury dispassionately awarded punitive damages to deter ""outrageous conduct"" rather than making up for compensatory 
damages that were excluded for lack of evidence. "
395,1," However, Ronald C. Giguere, President, Director and principal stockholder of Diversified Foods, Inc. was a plaintiff in the state 
court proceedings but is not a party in this suit.  Further, five corporations affiliated with DFI were defendants in FNB's state court 
collection claims but are not parties to this action."
395,2," The provision granting jurisdiction under the BHCA is 12 U.S.C. § 1975. It states: ""Any person who is injured in his business or 
property by reason of anything forbidden in section 1972 of this title may sue therefor in any district court of the United States. . . 
."" Use of the permissive term ""may"" here is consistent with the presumption of concurrent state court jurisdiction.  See, e.g., 
Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U.S. at 460-61."
395,3," The jurisdictional grant under the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15, provides: ""Any person who shall be injured in his business or 
property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the United States. . . ."" "
396,4," DFI essentially concedes this point in its January 31, 1991 Motion to Amend the Complaint to add the state claims.  In support 
of this motion DFI said: ""The facts forming the basis for the state claims are the same facts which form the basis of the pending 
action relating to the Banks' having violated the [BHCA]."" Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law Supporting Motion to Amend at 2."
396,5," DFI's assertions to the contrary, I find nothing in the record demonstrating that FNB tacitly acquiesced to having the BHCA 
claims litigated in this forum.  FNB objected to DFI's proposed amendment to the state court complaint which referred to ""illegal"" 
and ""anti-competitive"" conduct on the grounds that such an amendment was untimely and unduly burdensome, not because it 
agreed that those issues were properly before the federal court.  FNB specifically put DFI on notice that it would object by raising 
claim splitting as an affirmative defense to the BHCA claims.  Despite this fact, DFI did not attempt to interject the BHCA claims 
into the state case until after the state court had granted summary judgment in favor of FNB. "
406,1," ""Realtor"" is a title only available for those who are members of the National Association of Realtors. The membership includes 
real estate brokers, agents, and others.  Membership categories also exist for realtors outside Montgomery County."
406,2," Montgomery County, which is immediately north of the District of Columbia, is part of the Washington suburbs.  The suburban 
D.C. real estate market includes not only Montgomery County, but other parts of southern Maryland and northern Virginia as 
well."
406,3," Real estate agents are not employees of the broker; rather, they are independent contractors."

406,5, Eighty-six percent of the users are licensed in and operate in Montgomery County.
406,6," There are more than 2,300 terminals that access MCAR's database; of these, approximately 1,629 are dummy terminals and 
678 are personal computers. Although MCAR sells and leases terminals and personal computers that are compatible with its 
mainframe, such equipment is also available from other vendors."
406,7," Given the difficulty of using the books, demand for them had slackened to the point that MCAR could no longer justify the cost 
of printing them. "
407,8," RPM offers its services only to users who have service access agreements with MCAR.  In order to use RPM's service, the 
user must have a personal computer; the service will not work on a dummy terminal that has neither a screen nor memory.  At 
present, RPM has approximately thirteen customers."
407,9, RPM's software is also capable of manipulating the data.
407,10," In the motion for a preliminary injunction, RPM is pressing only the claim that MCAR's new database constitutes an illegal 
tying arrangement; RPM's other claims will be considered later.  The trial on the merits is scheduled for later this year."
407,11," Stephen Snell, the executive director of the York County Board of Realtors, testified that in 1987 his association added on-line 
photographs to its database. He and other witnesses testified without contradiction that the clear trend among associations is to 
offer photographs."
407,12," RPM's management previously owned a company, Applied Management, that attempted to market at the association level, but 
was unsuccessful.  Similarly, John Pistacchi, president of Opticom Corporation, testified that his company initially targeted 
individual realtors as potential customers for his realty photo service, but discovered that the true market was at the association 
level."
407,13," RPM contends that MCAR's surveys revealed little interest among its members for on-line photos; MCAR contends the 
opposite.  This dispute is of no particular relevance to the motion for a preliminary injunction. The record developed thus far "
408,," shows that MCAR studied potential uses for computers and concluded that the addition of on-line photographs was desirable 
and economical.  Contrary to RPM's claims, this Court is not persuaded that MCAR chose to add pictures for an ulterior reason 
such as harming RPM or decreasing competition among individual realtors."
408,14," Users with ""dummy"" terminals will be able to receive the photos on a facsimile machine.  Those with personal computers and 
Opticom's software can display, manipulate, and print the entire database."
408,15," There exists an active market for access software in the real estate industry.  Vendors offering software that manipulates and 
augments multiple-list data include Tool Kit, Real MLS, Realty Board, MLS Link."
408,16," RPM contends that the price increase will not fully cover the increased cost.  It is unnecessary at this stage to decide RPM's 
undeveloped argument that MCAR is engaging in a form of ""predatory pricing."" "
409,17," MCAR disputes that RPM will be put out of business and contends that: (i) RPM derives income from sales of equipment and 
software and is, therefore, not financially dependent on sales of photographic services; (ii) it is not a certainty that customers will 
prefer the MCAR system; and (iii) RPM can stay in business by selling its services to real estate associations throughout the 
country. In ruling on the preliminary injunction motion, the Court concludes that RPM, a local and apparently under-funded company, 
could not, as its president testified, withstand the loss of its principal source of revenue, which is derived from subscription fees."
409,18," Opticom's president, John Pistacchi, testified that his company has devoted substantial time, energy, and money to its contract 
with MCAR and reluctantly agreed to the ""breakaway"" clause to avoid losing the contract.  The Court credits Pistacchi's 
testimony that his company would be substantially injured by an injunction. Although Opticom is not a party to this case, the 
Court may consider hardship to it under the ""public interest"" prong of the Blackwelder test. "
410,19," HN5[
] In order for the Sherman Act to apply, the challenged activity must substantially affect interstate commerce.  In Cantor v. Multiple Listing Serv., 568 F. Supp. 424, 430 (S.D.N.Y. 1983), the court held that the multiple-listing service in 
Dutchess County affected interstate commerce by stimulating the volume of sales of residential and commercial properties.  This 
Court likewise finds that while the sale of real estate is inherently local, MCAR's activities affect real estate markets in northern 
Virginia, southern Maryland, and the District of Columbia and facilitate the purchase of real estate by persons moving in and out 
of the Washington suburbs.  Thus, the interstate commerce test is satisfied, and MCAR's actions are subject to the antitrust 
laws."
410,20," HN7[
] Because the Sherman Act is concerned with anti-competitive behavior in the marketplace, courts are generally 
suspicious of cooperative arrangements among competitors, including associations of realtors. See Wells Real Estate v. Greater 
Lowell Bd. of Realtors, 850 F.2d 803 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 955, 102 L. Ed. 2d 381 , 109 S. Ct. 392 (1988); United

(1980); O'Riordan v. Long Island Bd. of Realtors, Inc., 707 F. Supp. 111 (E.D.N.Y. 1988). Nevertheless, it is well recognized that 
associations benefit the entire real estate industry.  Multiple-listing services make real estate a more liquid commodity by 
disseminating information, thus engendering a more realistic price structure in the residential real estate market.  See Arthur D. 
Austin, Real Estate Boards and Multiple Listing Systems as Restraints of Trade, 70 Colum. L. Rev. 1325, 1329-30 (1970)."

] All contracts or combinations do, in some sense, restrain trade. Consequently, courts have construed section 1 of the Sherman Act to prohibit only those contracts or combinations that unreasonably restrain trade. In determining whether restraints 
of trade unreasonably restrict competition, courts have used two complementary methods of analysis: the per se rule and the 
rule of reason. ""In the first category are agreements whose nature and necessary effect are so plainly anticompetitive that no 
elaborate study of the industry is needed to establish their illegality -- they are 'illegal per se.' In the second category are 
agreements whose competitive effect can only be evaluated by analyzing the facts peculiar to the business, the history of the 
restraint, and the reasons why it was imposed."" National Soc'y of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 692, 55

412,25," Under RPM's analysis, MCAR would be prohibited by section 1 of the Sherman Act from augmenting its database to include 
additional information if that augmentation had the ancillary effect of harming a company that had begun providing such 
information.  The antitrust laws do not and should not prevent MCAR from improving its product.  Foremost Pro Color, 703 F.2d

433,4," Williams had take-or-pay provisions in its contracts with natural gas suppliers. A take-or-pay provision obligates a pipeline to 
pay for certain volumes of gas even if the pipeline is unable to sell that amount to its customers."
433,5," Williams was still required to transport third party gas pursuant to FERC's Order No. 451 which ""established procedures for the

444,1," McKenzie is distinguishable because in that case the plaintiff himself did not and could not agree to the illegal arrangement, nor 
did he allege that anyone else had done so. Compare Smith Mach. Co. v. Hesston Corp., 878 F.2d 1290, 1294 (10th Cir. 1989),

analyzed merits under theory that defendant induced plaintiff's competitors to accede). "
448,*," Each of the ""supporting cast"" defendants gave this reason either as its exclusive reason or as one of several reasons. In either 
circumstance, the reason is sufficient to explain each defendant's conduct as merely interdependent. The plaintiffs argue that, 
with regard to those defendants who gave the reason as one among several and thus used different methodologies, it is very 
unlikely that these defendants could have reached the same price results. However, the plausible response to this argument 
from the evidence is that the ""meeting-rival-prices"" reason was the dominant reason. See Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. 
Zenith Radio Corporation, 475 U.S. 574, 588, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 1356, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (a jury is not permitted to find a 
conspiracy merely because evidence points in that direction; conduct as consistent with permissible competition as with illegal 
conspiracy does not, standing alone, support an inference of a conspiracy); see also Areeda P 1405 at pp. 21-22. "
454,1," Specifically, the Complaint alleges violations of 15 U.S.C. §§ 1 and 2 (Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act) and 15 U.S.C. § 
18 (Section 7 of the Clayton Act)."
454,2," Defendants' motion addressed to the Fourth and Fifth Claims for Relief is denominated in the alternative as one brought 
pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c) or Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The motion addressed to the Seventh Claim for Relief is brought 
pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c)."
454,3," Except as otherwise noted, the description of the parties is drawn from the allegations of the Complaint."
454,4," Television programming services, such as Plaintiff SNI's Showtime and The Movie Channel and Defendant HBO, Inc.'s Home 
Box Office, function, along with cable system operators and individual viewers (or ""subscribers""), as components of what Judge 
Leisure has described as a three-link chain of distribution in the subscription television industry. See Telstat v. Entertainment & 
Sports Programming Network, 753 F. Supp. 109, 110 (S.D.N.Y. 1990). Unlike viewers of traditional broadcast television, 
subscribers to cable (a popular form of subscription television) receive programming in exchange for the payment of subscription 
fees to cable system operators who function as local distributors in the areas they serve, usually Under exclusive franchises 
from local municipal or county authorities. In addition to ""basic cable,"" subscribers may choose to obtain the ""premium"" 
programming made available--for an additional fee, usually paid monthly--by the cable operator. In general, pay television 
programming services such as Showtime, The Movie Channel, and HBO create or obtain the rights to television programs, "
455,," arrange them in schedules, and transmit the programming so assembled, via communications satellites, to cable system 
operators, who offer it to subscribers as described above."
455,5," The Complaint alleges that ""Defendant HBO, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Defendant Time . . . ."" (Compl. P 8.) The 
Answer generally denies this averment but states that ""HBO, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Time Warner with its principal 
place of business at 1100 Avenue of the Americas [in New York City]."" (Answer P 8.)"
455,6," The Complaint alleges that ""Defendant ATC is an 82 percent owned subsidiary of Defendant Time . . . ."" (Compl. P 9.) 
Defendants answer that Time Warner owns 82% of ATC's stock and 93% of the combined voting power of the two classes of its 
common stock. (Answer P 9.)"
455,7," Plaintiffs assert that ""as of October 31, 1990, ATC owned or managed cable systems capable of reaching or 'passing' 7.65 
million homes in the United States"" and that ""the only cable access pay television program services have to these 7.65 million 
homes is through ATC."" (Pls.' Local Rule 3(g) Statement P 4.) According to Defendants, the areas in which ATC offers cable 
television services comprise approximately 7.2 million homes and accounted, as of December 1988, for approximately 4 million 
subscribers to ATC's basic cable service, of whom approximately 3.1 million were also subscribers to pay television services. 
(Defs.' Local Rule 3(g) statement P 15.) "
456,8," The alternative designation applies to all except that portion of the motion that seeks dismissal of the Seventh Claim for Relief 
insofar as it is pleaded against Defendants ATC and MCTV. See supra note 2. With respect to the Seventh Claim, Defendants 
seek dismissal as against ATC and MCTV on jurisdictional grounds."
456,9," Defendants' argument for judgment on the pleadings or summary judgment on the Fourth Claim for Relief comprises 
approximately twenty-seven pages of the Memorandum supporting Defendants' motion. Thirteen pages of the Memorandum are 
devoted to Defendants' preliminary statement and elaboration of factual background. Defendants' arguments addressed to the 
Fifth and Seventh Claims together comprise just under five full pages of the Memorandum."
456,10," Plaintiffs identify two cable markets as relevant to the disposition of their claims: a market for pay television programming 
services, which is alleged to be nation-wide in scope, and a market for local delivery of cable television to subscribers (Compl. 
PP 16, 23.) For the purposes of this motion, Defendants assume the existence of both markets. (Defs.' Mem. Supp. at 3-4.) The 
Court likewise assumes, for the purposes of this motion, the existence of both markets and their relevance to the disposition of 
Plaintiffs' claims."
456,11," A note about the procedural implications of Defendants' decision to proceed under Rule 12(c) is in order here. HN1[
] A 
Defendant's pre-answer motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted is of course a motion 
pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6); the Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings may be interposed after the answer is filed, as a 
vehicle for raising defenses enumerated in Rule 12(b) that have not been raised in the pleadings or by preliminary motion and 
that are expressly preserved by Rule 12(h). See 5A Charles A. Wright and Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice And Procedure P 
1367 (1990). Thus the defense of failure to state a claim may be the subject of a Rule 12(c) motion because Rule 12(h)(2) so 
provides, and Defendants' Rule 12(c) motion addressed to the Fourth and Fifth Claims is not improper here; similarly, the 
purported jurisdictional defect of which Defendants complain in the motion addressed to the Seventh Claim for Relief may be 
raised in the Rule 12(c) motion because that maneuver is apparently contemplated by Rule 12(h)(3). See Id. The standards to 
be applied to a Rule 12(c) motion that identifies deficiencies in the pleadings are those that would have been appropriate to the 
disposition of a pre-answer motion under Rule 12(b). See Id. at 515-16 (""The mere fact that these procedural defects are raised 
in the guise of a Rule 12(c) motion should not affect the manner by which the court determines what essentially are Rule 12(b) "
457,," matters."") Thus a trial court reviewing a defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings must consider as true all well pleaded 
factual allegations of the complaint, and must draw all inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. Id. See also Madonna v. 
United States, 878 F.2d 62, 65 (2d Cir. 1989). This Court notes its concurrence in the view that partial judgment on the pleadings 
should be available, in appropriate circumstances, by analogy to the provisions of Rule 56(d) governing partial summary 
judgment, notwithstanding the absence of any clearly comparable provision in Rule 12(c). 5A Wright Miller, supra, P 1369 at 
537."
457,12," In further support of the motion to dismiss the Fourth Claim, Defendants argue that the ""essential facilities"" doctrine invoked 
by Plaintiffs does not relieve Plaintiffs of the burden of pleading and proving market power in the relevant market. HN2[
] 
Although the essential facilities doctrine is sometimes analyzed as a distinct claim under the Sherman Act, see Soap Opera 
Now, Inc. v. Network Publishing Corp., 737 F. Supp. 1338, 1343 (S.D.N.Y. 1990), this Court generally concurs in Defendants' 
view that the doctrine is more properly characterized as a label that may aid in the analysis of a monopoly claim, not a statement 
of a separate violation of law. See Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 736.1a (Supp. 1990). It follows that 
the essential facilities argument relieves Plaintiffs here of no burden they would otherwise bear, and constitutes no substitute for 
a showing that the requirements of a cause of action under the antitrust laws have been met. Of course, even without stating a 
separate antitrust claim, the essential facilities analysis may lend theoretical support to a claim of actual or attempted "
458,," monopolization, Soap Opera Now at 1343, and color to an antitrust plaintiff's description of the circumstances giving rise to his 
prayer for relief. But the weight of the argument as made by Plaintiffs here in connection with their claim under Section Two of 
the Sherman Act need not be determined, since the Court finds as a matter of pleading that the Fourth Claim for Relief fails to 
allege actual monopolization of local cable markets but adequately states a claim of monopoly leveraging. See infra pp 11-22."
458,13," Defendants' statement pursuant to Local Rule 3(g) includes a recitation of statistics (culled from the Kagan Census of Cable 
and Pay Television and the Kagan Census of Cable System Ownership) indicating ATC and MCTV market shares of several 
cable markets in the years 1981-1989. During that period, ATC's percentage share (including MCTV) of the total number of 
homes in the United States ""passed"" by cable is claimed never to have exceeded 9.4%; its share of total subscribers to basic 
cable television never to have exceeded 9%; and its share of total pay subscriptions never to have exceeded 9.3%. (Defs.' Local 
Rule 3(g) Statement, PP 17-19.) Plaintiffs' Local Rule 3(g) Statement contains no direct response to these assertions. In 
response to Defendants' contention that ATC and MCTV at no time relevant to the motion possessed market power in the 
market ""containing"" pay television programming (Defs.' Local Rule 3(g) Statement PP 27-28), Plaintiffs state that ATC and 
MCTV, through their ""monopoly power over access to a substantial number of cable subscribers, [have] the power to distort 
competition in the market for pay television programming services."" (Pls.' Local Rule 3(g) statement PP 17-18.) "
460,14," Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320 (1961), a case upon which Defendants rely in part in their argument in 
support of the motion addressed to the Fourth Claim for Relief, is not to the contrary. In Tampa, the Supreme Court's holding 
that an exclusive requirements contract did not violate the proscriptions of the Clayton Act was premised on a determination that 
the arrangement did not ""work a substantial . . . lessening of competition in the relevant competitive market""--there the market 
for production and sale of bituminous coal--because it involved ""neither a seller with a dominant position in the market . . . nor 
myriad outlets with substantial sales volume coupled with an industry-wide practice of relying upon exclusive contracts . . . nor a 
plainly restrictive tying arrangement . . ."" Tampa, 365 U.S. at 333, 334. The instant case is distinguishable from Tampa in the 
significant sense that Defendant HBO, Inc., a seller of pay programming services, is alleged to dominate the national market for 
pay television programming--the arena in which Plaintiffs' and Defendants' subsidiary services compete. Twin Laboratories, Inc. v. Weider Health & Fitness, 900 F.2d 566 (2d Cir. 1990), also is not to the contrary. Although it 
characterizes as dictum a similarly worded formulation which appears on page 284 of the decision in Berkey, Twin Laboratories 
casts no doubt on the continuing viability of Berkey's holding that ""a firm violates § 2 [of the Sherman Act] by using its monopoly 
power in one market to gain a competitive advantage in another, albeit without an attempt to monopolize the second market,"" 
Berkey, 603 F. 2d at 275. "
462,15," Having rejected Defendants' arguments that the ""conspiracy element"" of the Fourth Claim for Relief is insufficient as a matter 
of pleading and will be unprovable as a matter of law, the Court notes that it is also unpersuaded by Defendants' reading of the 
Fourth Claim to contain an allegation of conspiracy to monopolize that is independent of the other allegations of Paragraphs 
132-135. Although it is unnecessary to the reasoning elaborated in this Memorandum and Order so to construe Plaintiffs' intent, 
the Court reads the conspiracy reference contained in lines 6-7 of Paragraph 134 primarily to track the language of the statute, 
and does not assume that the inclusion of the phrase was intended by the draftsman to do more than elaborate the allegation of 
monopoly leveraging upon which the Fourth Claim is centrally founded. "
463,16," Scholarly authority confirms the view that it is not so much the ""pervasiveness"" of a regulatory scheme per se, but rather 
Congress' intent in enacting the legislation, and the effect of regulation on conduct arguably subject to the antitrust laws, that 
determines whether ""implied immunity"" from antitrust liability should be found. ""The scope and intensity of a regulatory regime 
does not indicate the extent to which Congress intended to confer antitrust immunity or to vest the responsibility for competition 
in the regulators rather than the courts. The main issue is not the breadth of regulation within an industry, but the impact of 
regulation on the challenged conduct."" 1 Areeda & Turner, supra, P 223. "
464,17," Plaintiffs' argument in opposition to the motion to dismiss the Fifth Claim as against Defendants ATC and MCTV is wholly 
unavailing. The liberality of the federal rules governing pleading notwithstanding, Plaintiffs' hypothetical conjecture that, ""for 
example, if ATC were to agree with HBO, Inc. and the Disney Channel to a time lock promotion that excludes Showtime and The 
Movie Channel, a proper Section 1 claim would lie . . . ."", (Pls.' Mem. Opp'n at 43), cannot be said to constitute the ""short and 
plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief"" called for by Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure. Nor in any case does such a statement, or its equivalent, appear in any allegation of the Complaint. As for the 
sufficiency of the unelaborated allegation of conspiracy contained in Paragraph 137, the ""bare bones"" assertion of concerted 
action in restraint of trade will not withstand a motion to dismiss. Telstat, 753 F. Supp. at 115. "
470,1," As correctly noted by defendant, this appeal required expeditious handling due to the involvement of questions concerning 
antitrust violations. Thus, HN1[
] under LSA-R.S. 51:134, the following requirements are provided: ""In all cases under this Part the defendant shall file all exceptions in limine litis, or if necessary in the alternative, after the usual 
delays, and any additional delays as the court may allow; however, a plea to the jurisdiction is not waived by other pleas or 
exceptions filed. The judge shall take up such exceptions in preference over all other business and shall decide all questions 
raised in the exceptions within ten days after submission, and his ruling shall have the effect of res judicata, unless the party cast 
shall appeal within five days. The appeal is returnable within ten days to the appellate court which shall hear and determine the 
case within forty days. If the exceptions are overruled by final judgment of the appellate court the defendant shall file his answer 
covering all questions of controverted fact within fifteen days, and the case may be set for trial on the application of either party, 
which case the judge shall consider in preference over all other business."""
470,2," Plaintiffs have also alleged breach of contract pour autrui, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud and unjust enrichment. These issues 
are not before us in this appeal."
470,3," The plaintiffs are: The Daily Advertiser; Richard D'Aquin; Mr. Cook Licensing Corporation d/b/a Mr. Cook Restaurants; 
Compagnie Vermilion Incorporated, Compagnie CL-BM, Ltd; and C. Earl Hagood, Jr., individually and on behalf of a class of all 
others similarly situated. "
471,4," It is averred that when the 1983 contract was perfected, Trans La and LIG were wholly owned subsidiaries of Celeron, Inc. 
Subsequently, Trans La was out and became a division of Atmos Energy Corporation, d/b/a Energas Company; T-Lig is a 
subsidiary of Trans La; Lig Chem and Tuscaloosa are subsidiaries of LIG."
471,5," In further explanation of WACOG, we find it appropriate to set forth paragraphs 15 and part of 16 of plaintiff's petition: ""15. The allowable rate that a pipeline operator such as LIG may charge a local distribution company such as TRANS-LA for 
intrastate natural gas is set by reference to its 'weighted average cost of gas ('WACOG'). A pipeline operator files with the 
Louisiana Public Service Commission ('PSC') a schedule of its monthly gas purchases detailed by producer, contract number, 
meter volume of gas delivered, and the amount paid. The total dollars paid are divided by the total gas purchased to arrive at the 
allowable monthly WACOG. The rate to a local distribution system such as TRANS-LA is WACOG, as adjusted monthly, plus a 
PSC-approved profit amount per mcf. which in the instant case was $ 0.13 per mcf. to be added to the WACOG (see PSC Rate 
Schedule GR-40 attached as Exhibit 'A-1' and PSC Order No. U-12587 dated November 22, 1974 approving PSC Rate 
Schedule GR-40, a copy of which is attached hereto and made a part hereof as Exhibit 'A-2')."
471,16," . A. The price that a local distribution system such as TRANS-LA may charge per mcf. of natural gas to its retail customers is its 
actual cost per mcf. of acquiring natural gas from pipeline operators (e.g., in this case, LIG). TRANS-LA is also allowed a certain 
'return on equity' investment. The PSC regulates local natural gas distribution companies such as TRANS-LA and controls how 
much a return on equity TRANS-LA is permitted in a given year."""
471,6," HN2[
] LSA-R.S. 51:137: ""Section 137. Damages recoverable for violation of law Any person who is injured in his business or property by any person by reason of any act or thing forbidden by this Part may sue 
in any court of competent jurisdiction and shall recover threefold the damages sustained by him, the cost of suit, and a 
reasonable attorney's fees."""
471,7," At this stage of the proceeding, the 1983 contract has not been admitted into evidence. From plaintiffs' petition it is alleged that 
Trans La entered into a ten year contract with LIG in which Trans La was obligated to obtain all intrastate natural gas from LIG 
unless LIG waived this ""all requirement"" provision. It is unclear at this point whether the other defendants were signatories to this 
contract. "
472,8," The defendants sought to remove this case to the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana however, 
the federal court found the removal improvident and remanded this action to the state district court. "

485,2," FERC may suspend the implementation of a wholesale rate increase for a maximum of five months and the rate then becomes 
automatically effective. 16 U.S.C. § 824d(e). Here Edison asked for a mere one-day suspension and FERC set the suspension 
at one month. By contrast, the CPUC does not allow any increase, interim or otherwise, without its approval."

513,1, The complaints filed by Oakland and Macomb are substantially similar. 
514,2," These defendants, along with those other defendants who have concurred in this motion, will be referred to as the ""Allevato 
Defendants."""
514,3," Defendants Detroit, Tomyn, Michigan Disposal, Inc., Beckham, Cusenza, Wolverine Disposal, Inc. and Wolverine Disposal-
Detroit, Inc. have moved to dismiss the claims against them by filing notices in which they concur in and adopt the motions and 
briefs of defendants Allevato, Detroit and Young. "
515,4," There seems to be some confusion as to the clause ""acting in an official capacity"" as it appears at the end of 15 U.S.C. § 35(a).  
This clause modifies ""official or employee"" and does not modify ""any local government."" Therefore, actions by local governments 
are exempted from monetary liability."
515,5, Macomb Compl. at para. 45. 
517,6," Oakland's argument that the LGAA does not immunize criminal activity is inapplicable to Detroit.  A municipality cannot form the 
requisite criminal intent. See infra pp. 13-14."
517,7," Oakland's complaint also expressly states that ""Young and Beckham each performed the acts alleged above in their official 
capacities as agents and officers of Detroit."" Oakland Compl. at para. 45.  Therefore, just as with Macomb's complaint, the 
LGAA also applies to Young and Beckham."
517,8," Oakland's argument that the LGAA does not immunize criminal activity is inapplicable to Young and Beckham.  Oakland's 
complaint only challenges activity conducted within Young's and Beckham's official capacities.  By definition, any official conduct 
must exclude criminal activity. Further, HN7[
] this court has not found any authority stating that the LGAA fails to immunize criminal activity. As the statute is 
plain on its face and lacks an exception for criminal conduct, this court will not read an exception into the LGAA. "
519,9," Because Count V is dismissed as to Detroit, the court will not address Detroit's alternative argument that plaintiffs have failed to 
properly plead a cause of action in Count V. "
520,10," Some courts have held that the civil RICO treble damage award is penal and therefore cannot survive the death of a 
defendant.  The majority of these courts are found in the Northern District of Illinois.  See Lincoln Nat'l Life Ins. Co. v. Silver, No.

521,12," United States v. Michigan, No. 77-71100 (E.D. Mich.). "
524,1," Generally, a court should determine whether it has jurisdiction over the person of the defendant before deciding where venue is 
proper.  Leroy v. Great Western United Corp., 443 U.S. 173, 180, 61 L. Ed. 2d 464, 99 S. Ct. 2710 (1979). However, ""when 
there is a sound prudential justification for doing so, . . . a court may reverse the normal order of considering personal jurisdiction 
and venue."" Id. In this case, both parties assert that the venue and personal jurisdiction analyses for a non-resident corporate 
antitrust defendant are virtually the same.  In accord with this assumption, the parties have devoted most of their argument to the 
issue of whether venue is proper in this district.  For this reason, this court will turn first to the issue of venue and then consider 
whether it has personal jurisdiction over Contel. "
525,2," In the Complaint, Phone Directories alleges that venue for this action is proper in this court under 28 U.S.C. § 1400(a).  As 
Contel points out, however, § 1400(a) establishes the venue requirements for patent and copyright claims.  Apparently, Phone 
Directories' citation to § 1400 in the Complaint was in error. Another basis for venue in antitrust actions is provided by § 4 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15(a), which allows for 
suit in any district where the defendant ""resides or is found or has an agent."" Phone Directories does not argue that the 
requirements of § 4 are satisfied in this case. "
526,3," In particular, the Court noted that the controls established by the contracts that created American Scophony called for 
Scophony's ""continuing exercise of supervision over and intervention in"" the affairs of its subsidiary. Scophony, 333 U.S. at 814. 
The ""continuing and pervasive effects"" of these agreements were illustrated by Scophony's power to appoint directors and 
officers to American Scophony, id., as well as the provisions calling for the interchange of data and information between the two 
companies.  Id. at 815. Moreover, according to the Court, the dual role played by some officers of American Scophony, who also 
acted as agents of Scophony, was evidence that these powers were used.  Id. "
527,4," In Cannon Manufacturing Co. v. Cudahy Packing Co., 267 U.S. 333, 69 L. Ed. 634, 45 S. Ct. 250 (1925), the Supreme Court 
considered whether a parent manufacturing company was doing business through its wholly-owned subsidiary in North Carolina 
""in such a manner and to such an extent as to warrant the inference that [the parent company] was present there."" Id. at 334-35. 
The parent company had established the subsidiary in North Carolina for the purpose of selling the parent company's products 
in that state.  The issue arose because the plaintiff in Cudahy attempted to make service of process on the parent company 
through the office of the parent's subsidiary in North Carolina.  Id. at 334. The parent company moved to have the district court 
quash the service, arguing that the subsidiary company was a separate legal entity.  Despite finding that the parent exercised 
immediate and complete control over the operations of the subsidiary, the trial court granted the parent company's motion 
because the formal aspects of the subsidiary's separate legal existence were strictly observed.  Id. at 335. On appeal, the 
Supreme Court affirmed, agreeing with the district court that ""the corporate separation, though perhaps merely formal, was real.  
It was not pure fiction."" Id. at 337. "
528,5," In addition to General's ownership of one hundred percent of Eddy's stock, the court found that some members of General's 
board of directors became directors of Eddy, although no officer or director of General ever became an officer of Eddy.  
Moreover, General was kept ""closely informed"" of Eddy's operations, Fisher, 238 F. Supp. at 326, and there was ""substantial 
communication"" between the personnel of General and Eddy.  Id. at 325. General's board of directors occasionally approved 
certain leases and major purchases by Eddy.  In addition, on one occasion, General's board approved a compensation package 
for certain Eddy management personnel. Eddy management personnel were also covered by General's management bonus 
incentive plan.  Id. at 326. Finally, Eddy was often referred to by both companies as a division of General.  Royal was a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Eddy."
528,6, See supra note 6.
528,7," See supra note 4 (discussing Cudahy).  Judge Christensen also contrasted the facts of Fisher with the facts of Intermountain 
Tractor Sales Co. v. Massey-Ferguson Ltd., 210 F. Supp. 930 (D. Utah 1962) (Christensen, J.), aff'd per curiam, 325 F.2d 713 
(10th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 931 (1964)."
528,8," The Fisher decision reflects the view taken by a least two United States Courts of Appeals, as well as a number of district 
courts.  See, e.g., San Antonio Tel. Co., Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 499 F.2d 349 (5th Cir. 1974) (citing Fisher); O.S.C. 
Corp. v. Toshiba America, Inc., 491 F.2d 1064 (9th Cir. 1974) (citing Judge Christensen's opinion in Massey-Ferguson); Chrysler 
Corp. v. General Motors Corp., 589 F. Supp. 1182 (D.D.C. 1984); Grappone, Inc. v. Subaru of Amer., Inc., 403 F. Supp. 123 
(D.N.H. 1975). Contel also cites Tiger Trash v. Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc., 560 F.2d 818 (7th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1034, 54 L. Ed. 
2d 782, 98 S. Ct. 768 (1978), as having adopting the day-to-day control test.  A fair reading of the case, however, compels a 
different interpretation.  The Tiger Trash court did recognize ""that a parent-subsidiary relationship consisting of mere investment 
holding by the parent would not be sufficient to bring it within [§ 12]."" Id. at 823. It also acknowledged that limited 
interorganizational activities such as record reporting or monitoring would not satisfy § 12 either.  Id. (citing Fisher).  The court, 
however, concluded that ""the fact that the subsidiary is not controlled to an ultimate degree is irrelevant to the decision to pierce 
the corporate veil for venue purposes."" Id. at 824. According to the court, to take a such a position would enable large American corporations like [Browning-Ferris Industries] to circumvent the antitrust laws by incorporating the 
many functional subparts of the parent into local operations.  This would thwart the Congressional intent to liberalize the 
restrictive venue provision in Section 7 of the Sherman Act by enacting Section 12 of the Clayton Act. "
529,, Id.
529,9," In addition to evidence that Standard owned all of Humble's stock, the plaintiff produced proof that Standard: chose Humble's 
directors; suggested financial and accounting guidelines for Humble; loaned money and contributed assets to Humble; provided 
Humble with research and technology; required Humble to submit an annual budget for approval; and appointed to Humble's a 
director whose responsibility was to act as a liaison with Standard.  Flank, 277 F. Supp. at 360-61. Standard, on the other hand, 
contended that no employee of Humble was directly supervised by Standard; the companies did not share directors; Humble's 
management was solely responsible for the day-to-day management of the subsidiary; and, Standard did not supervise or 
approve Humble's daily pricing or markets, or require reports on such, except for general periodic reports on Humble's financial 
condition.  Id. at 361."
529,10," According to the court, the Cudahy decision emphasized such formal matters as whether the companies kept separate 
charters, by-laws and accounts.  Flank, 277 F. Supp. at 362. At the same time, the Cudahy decision discounted ""such important 
factors as the parent's purpose (business of investment) in creating the subsidiary, and the degree of economic control 
exercised by the parent over the subsidiary through stock ownership and other means."" Id. "
530,11," Examples of decisions taking an approach similar to that of the Flank court include: Tiger Trash v. Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc., 
560 F.2d 818 (7th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1034, 54 L. Ed. 2d 782, 98 S. Ct. 768 (1978); Zenith Radio Corp. v. 
Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd., 402 F. Supp. 262 (E.D. Penn. 1975); Hitt v. Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., 399 F. Supp. 838, 840-43

parent holds subsidiary as mere investment or as means of transacting business) "
531,13," The Supreme Court reiterated the remedial purposes of § 12 in United States v. National City Lines, Inc., 334 U.S. 573, 92 L. 
Ed. 1584, 68 S. Ct. 1169 (1948), where the Court determined that when an antitrust action is brought in any district authorized 
under § 12, the action cannot be transferred under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.  In its opinion, the National City Lines 
Court extensively examined the legislative history of § 12.  Id. at 582-88. The Court concluded that in enacting § 12, Congress 
was not concerned about abuse of the venue provisions by plaintiffs.  Id. at 581. Nor was it concerned with making it easier for 
defendants to defeat plaintiffs' choices of venue. Rather, Congress' concern ""was to provide broader and more effective relief, 
both substantively and procedurally, for persons injured by violations of its antitrust policy."" Id. at 581. More recently, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has cited the remedial purpose of § 12 as a basis for 
concluding that the nationwide service of process provision of that section may be used by a plaintiff even if venue is established 
under 28 U.S.C. § 1391. Go-Video, Inc. v. Akai Elec. Co., Ltd., 885 F.2d 1406, 1410-11 (9th Cir. 1989). See also Board of City 
Comm'rs v. Wilshire Oil Co. of Texas, 523 F.2d 125, 132 (10th Cir. 1975) (citing remedial purpose of § 12 in determining that 
general venue statute supplements venue provisions of § 12); Lee v. Ply* Gen Indus. Inc., 593 F.2d 1266, 193 App. D.C. 112 
(D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 967 (1979) (citing remedial purpose of § 12 as basis for concluding that relevant date for 
determining when defendant transacted business is date that cause of action arose)."
531,14," See also Tiger Trash v. Browning-Ferris Indus. Co., 560 F.2d 818, 824 (7th Cir. 1977) (corporations should not be allowed to 
circumvent antitrust laws by incorporating into many local subparts)."
531,15," The court finds that this organizational structure is hierarchical; that is, the divisional offices report to the regional offices, who 
in turn report to the corporate offices."
531,16," Contel attempts to obfuscate Doolin's employment relation by claiming that she ""works"" for both Contel West and Contel 
Northwest.  The court finds that although it is true that Doolin performs services for both subsidiaries, Doolin is employed by the "
532,," Mountain West Division of Contel.  Compare Contel Corporation's Appendix of Exhibits, Exhibit I, Affidavit of Sharon Doolin, 
PP1, 2, with Contel Corporation's Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss, at 7-8, PP13, 14"
532,17," Contel claims that in her deposition, Sharon Doolin testified the MAPs were ""merely guidelines"" that Contel West is free to rely 
on or disregard altogether.  This court believes that Contel's interpretation of Doolin's statement is overdrawn.  Rather, a 
reasonable interpretation of Doolin's responses is that some provisions of the MAPs leave room for interpretation.  The divisional 
employees are free to interpret these provisions, so long as they have cleared their interpretations with their superiors in the 
organizational ranks of Contel.  See Contel Corporation's Appendix of Exhibits, Exhibit G, Deposition of Sharon Doolin, at 128.  
The fact that these policies are subject to interpretation does not mean they are merely suggestions.  Moreover, simply because 
one employee chooses not to follow company policy does not mean that it ceases to be company policy."
532,18, All of the contracts between Contel's telephone subsidiaries and Mast Advertising & Publishing Company are identical.
532,19," Contel maintains that there is no evidence that Contel provides financial assistance to Contel West.  See Contel Corporation's 
Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss, at 6, P10.  Yet, one of Contel's own exhibits states that Contel West has an 
unsecured line of credit with Contel Capital Corporation, an affiliate of Contel West and presumably another wholly-owned 
subsidiary of Contel, in the amount of $ 10 million.  See Contel Corporation's Appendix of Exhibits, Exhibit L, Contel of the West, 
Inc. Financial Statements, at 3 (page 3 of notes). "
533,20," Contel notes that Contel West is solely responsible for its own advertising, accounting, bookkeeping services, pension 
management, inventory, and for selecting and paying its own legal counsel.  Contel's exhibits, however, suggest that Contel 
West participates in Contel's pension plan.  See Contel Corporation's Appendix of Exhibits, Exhibit L, Contel of the West, Inc. 
Financial Statements, at 7 (page 7 of notes).  Similarly, whereas Contel West may ultimately select and pay its own legal 
counsel, Contel's MAP entitled ""Handling Requests For Release of Subscriber Listings"" requires that any copyright infringement 
action with respect to Contel West's telephone subscriber listings must be ""coordinated"" through Contel's legal department.  See 
Contel Corporation's Appendix of Exhibits, Exhibit H, Management Administrative Procedure, at 4."
533,21," The court, however, notes that both Contel and Phone Directories quote an antiquated version of § 1391 in their papers.  The 
version cited by the parties was significantly amended in 1988 and again in 1990.  See Judicial Improvements and Access to 
Justice Act, Pub. L. No. 100-702, Title X, § 13013(a), 102 Stat. 4669 (1988); Judicial Improvements Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 
101-650, Title I, § 311, 104 Stat. 5114 (1990).  This may explain why neither party argues the applicability of 28 U.S.C. § 
1391(c).  Section 1391(c), taken in conjunction with § 1391(b), provides for venue in an action where all defendants reside, and 
defines the residence of a corporate defendant as any district where the corporation is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the 
court. "
534,22," In an action in federal court arising under federal law, the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment guides the constitutional 
branch of the jurisdictional inquiry.  Max Daetwyler Corp. v. R. Meyer, 762 F.2d 290, 293 (3d Cir. 1985). "
543,1," Western Massachusetts Electric Company, as an intervener. "
545,2," The details of the program are not important to this appeal.  It is sufficient to say that industrial self-generators (and others who 
receive electricity from sources other than the company) do not receive the same treatment under the company's conservation 
programs as do customers who rely on the company fully."
545,3," Monsanto's appeal from the department asserts that the restrictions violate the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 
(PURPA).  See 16 U.S.C. §§ 2601 et seq. (1988).  The department's decision did not discuss PURPA.  As far as the record 
shows, Monsanto did not raise any argument based on PURPA before the department in this proceeding, although it has done 
so in an appeal from a subsequent department decision concerning the company.  We shall not specifically address the PURPA 
claim.  See Seagram Distillers Co. v. Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm'n, 401 Mass. 713, 724 (1988)."
545,4," The Massachusetts Antitrust Act ( G. L. c. 93, §§ 1-14A [1990 ed.]) states that it should be ""construed in harmony with judicial 
interpretations of comparable federal antitrust statutes insofar as practicable."" § 1. That language suggests the application of 
State action immunity principles to G. L. c. 93.  See Commonwealth v. Mass. CRINC, 392 Mass. 79, 90-91 (1984). Section 7 (b) 
reaches the same result (and perhaps more) by providing explicitly that G. L. c. 93 does not apply to ""[a]ny activities which are 
subject to regulation or supervision by state . . . agencies."" Monsanto's claim under the State antitrust law certainly must fail if 
Monsanto's Federal antitrust claim is foreclosed by the State action doctrine. "
546,5," Monsanto claims, without the citation of supporting authority, that, because any immunity granted by the State action doctrine is 
an affirmative defense, the department improperly decided the antitrust issues on State action grounds without first deciding 
whether there was an antitrust violation.  The argument that, in deciding this matter, the department could not go directly to a 
dispositive affirmative defense is meritless.  Our attention will focus on whether there was such a defense."
546,6," According to the department's decision, ""[f]ree-riders are individuals who would have installed [conservation and load 
management] measures even without participating in a particular company-sponsored program."" Monsanto was in a position to 
be a free rider in a special way by accepting the company's financial assistance toward fuel saving measures and then reducing 
its purchases of electricity from the company. "
554,1," Effective July 1, 1993, the New York State Department of Health will require all emergency service attending physicians to be 
duly licensed, currently registered, and Board-certified or Board-admissible (eligible to take the examination) in either emergency 
medicine, family practice, surgery, or internal medicine. See, 10 N.Y.C.R.R. §405.19."
554,2," Other medical specialties also  [**21] have associations of physicians which certify physicians in particular specialties in much 
the same way as the Board certifies physicians in emergency medicine, e.g., the American Board of Internal Medicine and the 
American Board of Ophthalmology. "
574,1," The trial court granted Triad injunctive relief which restrained the Caller Times ""from targeting Plaintiff's customers or potential

Business and Commerce Code. The Caller-Times challenged the injunction on the ground that it was overbroad and vague. 
Triad conceded that the injunction was overbroad and vague and the court of appeals dissolved the injunction. 791 S.W.2d 163, 
174. The injunction was not an issue in this court."
574,2," Prior to the filing of the instant suit in state court, the majority shareholders in Triad Communications, David Mock and George 
Magel, filed suit twice in federal district court against the parent corporation of the Caller-Times, Harte-Hanks Communications, 
Incorporated, seeking relief under the Sherman Act from the Caller-Times' allegedly monopolistic conduct. The first time, the 
federal claims were dismissed without prejudice at the request of Mock and Magel. The federal claims were refiled and then 
dismissed with prejudice in November of 1985. Mock and Magel had requested a second dismissal without prejudice. However, 
the court granted dismissal with prejudice. In its order, the court stated that the dismissal was with prejudice because the cause 
had already been dismissed once without prejudice, because of the costs incurred by Harte-Hanks, and because the judge felt 
that Mock and Magel were only forum shopping. "

is no Supreme Court precedent and there is a conflict between circuits. Comment, supra, at 1199. This suggestion was rejected.

577,6," This element of the test is equally appropriate even if the seller acts irrationally. Whether a seller acts rationally or irrationally, 
predatory conduct will be marked by the same objective factors. The fact finder can determine whether there was an objective 
rational economic motive even if the seller acted irrationally."
577,7," We are not faced with the question of what factors a court should consider to determine whether a seller will have an 
objectively reasonable expectation of recouping its losses. Relevant factors must be determined on a case by case basis. While 
we neither endorse every factor on this list nor exclude any other factor, we anticipate that the following factors would be 
relevant: the type of goods or services in question; the economic condition of the predator; relative market strength of the seller; 
the number of competitors in the relevant market; nature of barriers to market entry; market demand; and the name recognition 
of the seller's products. We neither reject nor embrace the rule of reason as a tool for analysis of predatory pricing problems. However, by considering 
the objective factors peculiar to a particular business, the first part of this test is entirely consistent with the rule of reason. See 
The White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 261, 9 L. Ed. 2d 738 , 83 S. Ct. 696 (1963). ""The Rule [of Reason] does not 
open the field of antitrust inquiry to any argument in favor of a challenged restraint that may fall within the realm of reason. 
Instead, it focuses directly on the challenged restraint's impact on competitive conditions."" National Society of Professional 
Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 688, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 , 98 S. Ct. 1355 (1978). See generally P. Joskow & A.

preserve the health of the competitive . . . rather than to promote the welfare of particular competitors."" 752 F.2d at 266. (citing 
Brown Shoe). Perhaps one reason why the dissent takes such a different view of the purpose of the antitrust laws is that the 
dissent relies on the position of turn of the century writers. The business environment and the tools for analysis of the business 
environment in this country have changed since Louis D. Brandeis wrote on antitrust in 1914. The dissent manages to infer from this opinion that it is predicated on the belief that predatory pricing is rare. The dissent argues 
that ""predatory pricing is a real danger,""     S.W.2d at    , and cites commentators for the proposition that predatory pricing exists.

581,21," Limit pricing is the monopolist's practice of pricing below its profit-maximizing price but above the price at which competitors 
may economically enter the market. See, e.g., Scherer, Industrial Market Structure and Economic Performance 332-43 (2nd ed. 
1980); Areeda & Turner, 3 Antitrust Law para. 714b (1978). An oversimplified example is when the monopolist's profit-maximizing price is $ 100 per unit, but a $ 100 price would attract entry while a $ 90 price would not. 
Average total costs (including a normal return on investment) at an efficient scale of output might be $ 80 to the monopolist but $ 
91 for newcomers. In that event, the monopolist will have to choose between inducing entry at the profit-maximizing price of $ 
100 and retaining the entire market at the $ 90 price. If the discounted income stream at the lower price exceeds that from 
sharing the market at the higher price, the monopolist will charge the lower price. Although the lower price would thus be the 
long-run, profit maximizing price, it is usually called a 'limit price'. . . ."

Standard at 1764 n.42 (Barry Wright did not hold that presumptions of legality based on pricing are ""absolutely conclusive.""). In 
addition to those circuits which I previously noted as allowing introduction of intent evidence, a ninth has adopted perhaps the

reasonably anticipated average variable cost should be conclusively presumed lawful."" Phillip Areeda & Donald F. Turner, 
Predatory Pricing and Related Practices under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 697, 733 (1975) (emphasis 
added). "
589,19," Among the technical deficiencies in the reasoning underlying the court's test noted by my dissent and confirmed by the most 
recent commentary are: the presence of irrational but strategically valid reasons to price predatorily with no expectation of 
recouping losses, such as deterring new market entries, Judicial Standard at 1775 & n. 128; the difficulty of determining average 
variable cost, which is not even the best cost measure of predation, id. at 1782, 1784; and the absence of a clear standard for 
""entry barrier."" Id. at 1781. "
601,1," As we discussed above, A-Abart included the same misleading citation in memoranda submitted to the district court. "
625,1," Procedural history since the 1983 decision includes a district court ruling granting summary judgment on the antitrust claims 
based on Hospital motives, Miller v. Indiana Hospital, 660 F. Supp. 250 (W.D. Pa. 1987) (Simmons, J.), and subsequent 
reversal, Miller v. Indiana Hospital, 843 F.2d 139 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 870, 102 L. Ed. 2d 147, 109 S. Ct. 178 (1988); 
and this Court's grant of summary judgment on immunity grounds, which was subsequently reversed.  Miller v. Indiana Hospital, 
930 F.2d 334 (3d Cir. 1991). "
626,2," Defendants have alleged that plaintiff has no standing to enforce the antitrust laws, since IMC was the only entity against 
whom the illegal restraint was allegedly directed. This Court disagrees. Plaintiff has made it clear that he alleges that the illegal 
restraint was directed to himself as a result of setting up IMC. Because plaintiff has alleged a direct economic injury traceable to 
defendants' actions that allegedly violated the antitrust laws, plaintiff has standing.  Out Front Productions, Inc. v. Magid, 748 
F.2d 166, 168 (3d Cir. 1984) (citing Association of Data Processing Service Organizations v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 152, 25 L. Ed. 
2d 184, 90 S. Ct. 827 (1970)). "
627,3," The rationale for use of the rule of reason under such circumstances has been aptly explained in Brown v. Our Lady of 
Lourdes Medical Center, 767 F. Supp. 618 (D.N.J. 1991), as follows: HN5[
] ""The use of a hospital's internal review procedures does not imply [an] anti-competitive state of mind. Review 
procedures are necessary to insure that hospital staff members are competent medical practitioners."" Goss v. Memorial Hosp. 
System, 789 F.2d 353, 355 (5th Cir. 1986). A medical staff is permitted to exclude an individual doctor based on that doctor's 
lack of professional competence or unprofessional conduct. When such a reason is offered for the exclusionary conduct, the 
court must apply the ""rule of reason"" to evaluate plaintiff's antitrust claim.  Weiss, 745 F.2d at 820. The court must utilize the rule 
of reason when considering conduct otherwise subject to per se condemnation under § 1 of the Sherman Act due to the public 
service aspect of the medical profession.  Weiss, 745 F.2d at 820-21 and cases cited therein. Brown, 767 F. Supp. at 628. Plaintiff indicates that, for purposes of this motion, he assumes that the rule of reason applies. "
628,4," Plaintiff has submitted a statement by a Dr. Gots to the effect that laboratory, radiology and minor surgery services offered by 
IMC were competitors to those services offered by the Hospital. However, as noted infra, n. 5, Dr. Gots would not be qualified to 
so testify since this is not an area of expertise of Dr. Gots. Id. "
631,5," Plaintiff did submit a report by Dr. Ronald E. Gots, M.D., Ph.D., which plaintiff asserts was intended to give expert testimony on 
the relevant geograhic market. In his report, Dr. Gots states that he had been specifically asked to determine in his best 
judgment whether plaintiff's loss of Hospital privileges was based upon criteria generally required and customarily utilized in 
revoking physician privileges, and to determine whether the documents provided and available suggest non-medical, economic 
motivations for the Hospital's adverse action taken against plaintiff. He does not comment on the relevant geographic market, 
nor would he be so qualified.  Thus, this report does not raise a genuine issue of material fact. Although plaintiff attempted to 
introduce the expert report of Dr. Klepper on the relevant geographic market, this Court, per Order dated February 19, 1992, 
ruled that such evidence would not be accepted. "
633,6," Although plaintiff points out that there was a decrease in supply of urologists for a short period of time following termination of 
his staff privileges, in fact, consumers' choice of urologists increased after 1979. (See defendants' answers to interrogatories, 
Dec. 4, 1991). Furthermore, plaintiff has at no time alleged that the relevant product market is urological services. "
650,1," In its motion for summary judgment on Plaintiffs' state law claims, NDPA argues that the Court should dismiss these claims 
without considering them for lack of jurisdiction. In their amended complaint, Plaintiffs assert that the Court has jurisdiction over 
the state claims under the doctrine of supplemental jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1367. Amended Complaint, paragraph 93. NDPA 
argues that under United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715 (1966) (now codified by 28 U.S.C. § 1367), the Court 
should dismiss the state law claims against NDPA. The Court has continuing jurisdiction over the federal antitrust claim made in 
Count V. Though Count V is not brought against NDPA, and the Court could probably dismiss the state claims against NDPA on 
pendent jurisdiction grounds, summary judgment in NDPA's favor is appropriate on the state claims. Accordingly, the Court will 
not dismiss the state claims for lack of pendent jurisdiction. "
651,2," FSC has not moved for summary judgment on Count V which states a claim for relief under Section 2(d) of the Clayton Act, 15 
U.S.C. § 13(d). Plaintiffs claim that FSC's conduct constitutes discrimination in allocation of advertising. This claim does not 
implicate the conduct Plaintiffs complain of in bringing their tortious interference claims -- namely the local area trading policy 
and the drop shipment charges. "
654,3," In discussing FSC's motion for summary judgment on the antitrust counts, Plaintiffs cite evidence to suggest that 800 number 
dealers make up 20% of the relevant wallcovering market. This evidence is far from precise, but it would tend to suggest that the 
number of wallpaper retailers who sell through 800 numbers is quite large. Therefore, this figure hurts rather than helps Plaintiffs' 
defamation claim. "
655,4," For purposes of the counterclaims found in FSC's answer, Plaintiffs are the counterclaim defendants and FSC is the 
counterclaim plaintiff. For ease of reference, however, the Court will continue to use the term ""Plaintiffs"" to identify the 
counterclaim defendants, and the term ""FSC"" to identify the counterclaim plaintiff. "
657,5, All parties agree that Pennsylvania law should apply. 
658,6," The secrecy FSC employed is as consistent with checking on compliance as it is with soliciting defamatory statements with 
which to build a case."
658,7," Plaintiff Yankee also points to a communication identified as Exhibit H to Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Support of Partial Summary 
Judgment on the Counterclaims. Plaintiffs argue that this statement's connection to Yankee is too tenuous to support a claim for 
defamation. In its response, FSC does not contest this assertion. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Exhibit H will no longer 
be considered as part of the basis for the defamation claim against Yankee. "
659,8," The parties also make reference to an internal memorandum which instructed American Blind representatives to say 
""Unfortunately, you are outside our trading area. Schumacher will not allow us to sell to you because of our discount policy."" 
Chevallier Deposition, Exhibit 21. Plaintiffs correctly argue that an internal memorandum does not satisfy the publication 
requirement. FSC's argument that Ann Martin heard an American Blind representative make a substantially similar statement 
about another manufacturer is unpersuasive. First, the statement was made about another manufacturer, not FSC, and its 
connection to statements about FSC is tenuous at best. "
670,1," Plaintiffs in this lawsuit are Futurevision Cable Systems of Wiggins, Inc., Futurevision Cable Systems of Houston, Inc., 
Futurevision Cable Systems of Water Valley, Inc., Futurevision Gulf Coast Cable System, Inc. and Futurevision Cable Systems 
of Grenada.  The plaintiffs that are involved in the present motion before the court are Futurevision Cable Systems of Wiggins, 
Houston, Water Valley and Grenada, which will be referred to herein collectively as Futurevision. "
671,2," By amendment to its complaint, Futurevision asserted identical claims against TNT, Inc.  TNT, Inc. moved for dismissal of the 
claims against it on the basis of insufficiency of service of process, which motion was denied by the court.  TNT, Inc. has not 
filed its own motion or joined in the present motions by ESPN and The Learning Channel. In addition to its claims against The 
Learning Channel, ESPN and TNT, Inc., Futurevision asserted claims against Multivision and B & E for alleged violations of 
federal and state antitrust laws. The court notes, however, that by way of an Agreed Order Of Dismissal entered March 12, 
1991, all claims by Futurevision against Multivision have been dismissed with prejudice. "
672,3," This is contrasted ""with the principle of per se unreasonableness, where the practice complained of has such an inherently 
harmful effect on competition that it should be 'conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate 
inquiry as to the precise harm' created by the practice.  Carlson, 678 F.2d at 1259 (quoting Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. United 
States, 356 U.S. 1, 5, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545, 78 S. Ct. 514 (1958))."
672,4," Futurevision's complaint alleges that the relevant product market is cable television services, and that the relevant geographic 
market is each of the governmental districts within the areas served by Multivision and B & E.  The court notes that some courts 
have held or suggested that cable television is not the relevant product market and that the appropriate market is instead 
passive visual entertainment, which includes cable television, satellite television, video cassette recordings and free over-the-air 
television.  See Cable Holdings of Georgia, Inc. v. Home Video, Inc., 825 F.2d 1559, 1563 (11th Cir. 1987) (could not conclude 
that jury's determination that product market was passive visual entertainment was clearly erroneous); Satellite Television & 
Associated Resources, Inc. v. Continental Cablevision of Virginia, Inc., 714 F.2d 351, 355 (4th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 
1027, 79 L. Ed. 2d 688, 104 S. Ct. 1285 (1984). This issue is treated infra at p. 12-13, 29-30. "
675,5," This court previously observed in connection with its denial of Futurevisions's motion for a temporary restraining order against 
Multivision, that Futurevision enjoyed substantial competitive success in each of the markets at issue within a relatively short period of time.  
During the same period of time, Multivision experienced a dramatic loss of subscribers. . . .  Multivision did not and has not 
regained any significant number of subscribers and Futurevision now has what it terms ""a respectable share"" of the market: 
981 subscribers in Wiggins, compared to Multivision's 380, or 72 percent of the market; 840 subscribers in Water Valley 
compared to Multivision's 810, or 51 percent of the market; and 799 subscribers in Houston, compared to Multivision's 570, 
or 58 percent of the market."
675,6," Futurevision's business may have been damaged by the granting of these contracts to its competitors, but such damage is no 
different than that experienced by an exclusive distributor when its exclusive distributorship is taken away and given to someone 
else.  There is no question that the ""jilted party"" is damaged, but in the absence of an antitrust violation causing antitrust injury, 
the antitrust laws provide no remedy.  In Ace Beer Distributors, Inc. v. Kohn, Inc., 318 F.2d 283 (6th Cir. 1963), the Sixth Circuit 
stated: HN10[
] The fact that a refusal to deal with a particular buyer without more, may have an adverse effect upon the buyer's 
business does not make the refusal to deal a violation of the Sherman Act. Damage alone does not constitute liability under 
the Act. Id. at 287. See also Muenster Butane, 651 F.2d at 296-98. "
676,7," The complaint states that ""Multivision Defendants and B & E . . . have engaged in a contract, combination and conspiracy with 
one or more of the channel providers to deprive Futurevision of the right to exhibit popular channel programming."" The complaint 
further states that ""Futurevision Plaintiffs are placed at a serious competitive disadvantage in entering the markets served by 
[Multivision and B & E]."" Absent an allegation of anticompetitive effect at the interbrand level, however, this states nothing more 
than ""commercial disappointment"" on behalf of the jilted distributor, Futurevision, see Muenster Butane, 651 F.2d at 296-98, for 
as the Sixth Circuit stated in Crane & Shovel: Every distribution choice by a manufacturer could be either a good or bad decision from a business standpoint, but the 
antitrust laws have never been intended to police such a choice, absent any allegation that such choice is part of a scheme 
to create a monopoly market power by the manufacturer, or which is based on, or causes, anticompetitive effect at the 
interbrand level."
676,854," F.2d at 810 (footnote omitted).  See also Ralph C. Wilson Indus., Inc. v. Chronicle Broadcasting Co., 794 F.2d 1359, 1364 
(9th Cir. 1986) (""A vertical agreement between an individual station and an individual supplier does not, without more, mean that 
the suppliers have engaged in the type of exclusive dealing covered under [the antitrust laws].  Moreover, . . . competition is not 
injured where a distributor seeks to obtain a product at the expense of any or all potential distributors."")."
676,8," In Elder-Beerman Stores Corp. v. Federated Dep't Stores, 459 F.2d 138 (6th Cir. 1972), the Sixth Circuit explained the rule of 
reason analysis in a case similar to the one at bar: We interpret the ""rule of reason"" as meaning that the granting of exclusive selling rights or acceptance of such exclusive 
selling rights, acts which are not prohibited by law unless there is a resulting foreclosure of market alternatives cannot, 
without proof of such foreclosure, form the basis for a jury verdict that the defendants had entered into a conspiracy to 
restrain trade. Id. at 46 (footnote omitted). "
678,9," HN14[
] A plaintiff relying on a theory of ""conscious parallelism"" must establish two elements: ""(1) that the defendants 
engaged in consciously parallel action, (2) which was contraryto their economic self-interest so as not to amount to good faith 
business judgment.  Royal Drug Co., 737 F.2d at 1437. "
681,10, But see supra n.4.
681,11," The court also noted the absence of any allegation in the complaint that these defendants have sufficient market power to 
foreclose Futurevision from obtaining quality programming, or that it has been unable to effectively compete in the cable service 
provider market as a result of the exclusive contracts. "
683,1," Futurevision also alleges that the ESPN and The Learning Channel exclusive contracts with Multivision and B & E ""deprive 
Futurevision Plaintiffs of the right to exhibit popular channel programming."" ESPN urges in its motion to dismiss that this 
allegation does not state a claim since under the law, Futurevision has no ""right"" to exhibit ""popular channel programming."" HN29[
] Section 2 does prohibit certain refusals to deal if the denial violates the ""essential facilities"" doctrine.  United States v. Terminal R.R. Ass'n, 224 U.S. 383, 410, 56 L. Ed. 810, 32 S. Ct. 507 (1912); Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 
366, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359, 93 S. Ct. 1022 (1973). To establish liability under this principle, Futurevision must demonstrate (1) control 
of the essential facility by defendants, (2) competitor's inability practically or reasonably to duplicate the facility, (3) denial of the 
use of the essential facility to a competitor, and (4) feasibility of providing the facility.  McKenzie v. Mercy Hosp. 854 F.2d 365, 
369 (10th Cir. 1988). Futurevision's own complaint makes clear that it has access to sufficient programming to allow it to enter, 
and succeed, in the relevant cable service markets without access to the Learning Channel or ESPN's Sunday Night Football.  
As such, any claim by Futurevision that it has been denied an ""essential facility"" by the defendants in this case cannot stand."
683,13," Requiring a plaintiff to provide some evidence that indicates that the defendant had the specific intent to monopolize is 
necessary to ensure that the antitrust laws ""do not chill the very conduct the antitrust laws are designed to protect."" Matsushita, "
684,475," U.S. at 594. As explained supra, exclusive dealing contracts, like other vertical arrangements, often create legitimate pro-
competitive benefits.  See Continental T.V., 433 U.S. at 54-56; Muenster Butane, 651 F.2d at 295-98. For this reason, it is well 
recognized that they are judged under the rule of reason. See id. Under Futurevision's theory, any supplier that grants an 
exclusive license to a licensee who allegedly uses the license as part of a scheme to monopolize its market is per se liable under 
the antitrust laws for conspiracy to monopolize. Such an application of the antitrust laws, however, would obviously result in 
suppliers foregoing the potential pro-competitive benefits from granting such licenses, and would therefore ""chill the very conduct 
the antitrust laws are designed to protect."" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 594."
684,14," Absent pendent jurisdiction, this court does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate Futurevision's state law claims.  According to the 
complaint, the five Futurevision plaintiffs are incorporated in Mississippi.  In addition, one of the defendants, B & E, has its 
principal place of business in Mississippi.  The diversity statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(c), provides that, for purposes of determining 
diversity jurisdiction, a corporation is deemed a citizen of both its state of incorporation and the state in which it has its principal 
place of business.  It is clear, therefore, that this court does not have diversity jurisdiction over this matter, as both Futurevision "
685,," and B & E are deemed citizens of Mississippi.  Under the rule of Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 7 U.S. 267, 2 L. Ed. 435 (1806), this lack 
of ""complete"" diversity precludes the exercise of diversity jurisdiction. "
691,1," American Superior had two distributorship agreements with Iams. One covered American Superior's Bluebonnet Milling 
Company (""Bluebonnet"") in Ardmore, Oklahoma, and the other covered its Texas division in Tomball, Texas."
691,2," Iams did not join Westway as a Defendant in its initial complaint. However, Iams joined Westway as a Defendant with its 
amended complaint. "
692,3," In this Court, the Oklahoma action is Case No. C-3-91-194 (S.D.Ohio). That action has been consolidated into case No. 90-
014."
692,4," The Defendants' counterclaim is nearly identical to their amended complaint in Case No. C-3-91-194, the Oklahoma action. 
The only substantive changes are that the counterclaim adds a fifth claim for relief (an allegation that Iams gave favorable 
treatment to another distributing company) and adds Westway as a claimant, a counterclaim plaintiff, in the second claim for 
relief."
692,5," $ 173,523.98 is less than the amount which Iams requested in its amended complaint. However, after making adjustments, the 
parties have agreed that American Superior has not paid Iams the sum of $ 173,523.98 for products which Iams shipped to 
American Superior. The parties have agreed, therefore, that the amount of $ 173,523.98 is the sum at issue in Iams' first claim 
for relief. "
693,6," American Superior raised Oklahoma antitrust law as both an affirmative defense and as a counterclaim. See Docs. # 80 and # 
81."
693,7," As is mentioned above, American Superior had two distributorship agreements with Iams. One covered Bluebonnet in 
Ardmore, Oklahoma, and the other covered its Texas division in Tomball, Texas. Thus, Iams argues that § 35 applies, if at all, 
only to its sales to Bluebonnet."
693,8," Normally before it could enter summary judgment on this part of Iams' claim, the Court would require Iams to file the deposition 
or to authenticate the portion of the deposition which it has already presented to the Court. However, as is discussed below, the 
Court agrees with Iams that the choice of law provision in the distributorship agreements prevent American Superior from relying 
on § 35 as a defense. Accordingly, it would be an unnecessary act for this Court to require Iams to file the entire deposition of 
Urbanosky or a certified portion of same."
693,9, The distributorship agreements are exhibits to Iams' verified amended complaint (Doc. # 10). 
694,10," By concluding that contract choice of law principles apply so that the choice of law provisions in the distributorship agreements 
may prevent the use of § 35 as an affirmative defense, the Court does not intend to suggest that those provisions prevent 
American Superior from asserting counterclaims based upon alleged violations of Oklahoma's antitrust laws. That question is not 
before the Court; consequently, the Court expresses no opinion on it."
694,11," This, of course, is not to suggest that the criminal law of state B may not apply."
694,12," Jarvis involved an attempt to apply the law of Ohio in the face of a choice of law provision which called for the application of 
another state's law, whereas this case involves a choice of law provision which requires the application of Ohio law with the 
argument that Oklahoma law should apply. The Court does not consider this distinction to be of any import."
694,13," In Tele-Save Merchandising, the Sixth Circuit relied on comments to § 187 of the Restatement to reach its conclusion that the 
existence of contacts with the state and the parties' equal bargaining strength are crucial factors to consider when determining "
695,," whether a policy is fundamental.  814 F.2d at 1123 (citing Restatement, § 187, comment g). The Tele-Save Merchandising court 
applied these factors to conclude that the Ohio Business Opportunity Plans Act, Ohio Rev. Code § 1334.01, et seq., was not the 
fundamental policy of Ohio, and, therefore, a contractual choice of law provision requiring the application of New Jersey law 
preempted that Act. Parenthetically, the Ohio Business Opportunity Plans Act provides ""any waiver of a purchaser of sections 
1334.01 to 1334.15 of the Revised Code is contrary to public policy and is void and unenforceable."" While it may seem anomalous to determine the fundamental policy of a state by reference to the quantity of contacts with that 
state and the equality of the parties' bargaining power, such an analysis is sanctioned by the comments to § 187 of the 
Restatement and by the Sixth Circuit."
695,14," Iams requests the Court to enter final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b). American Superior does not argue that the Court 
should not so enter final judgment. "
696,15," Iams' motion to dismiss (Doc. # 89) is captioned ""Plaintiff's supplemental memorandum in support of the Iams Company's 
motion to dismiss Defendants' claims under Section 2 of the Sherman Act."" With this memorandum, Iams supplements the 
motion to dismiss which it filed in the Oklahoma action (Case No. C-3-91-194). With respect to the claim under § 2 of the 
Sherman Act, Defendants' counterclaim (Doc. # 81) is identical to their amended complaint in the Oklahoma action (Doc. # 31 in 
Case No. C-3-91-194). Therefore, the Court treats the supplemental memorandum (Doc. # 89) as a motion to dismiss the § 2 of 
the Sherman Act claim (the fourth claim for relief) in Defendants' counterclaim (Doc. # 81). However, in ruling on same, the Court 
considers the memoranda filed by the parties in the Oklahoma action (Docs. # # 7, 17, 30, 36, 40, and 48 in Case No. C-3-91-
194). Parenthetically, in its motion to dismiss in the Oklahoma action (Doc. # 7 in Case No. C-3-91-194), Iams sought dismissal 
of Defendants' claims under § 3 of the Clayton Act and Title 79, § 1, of the Oklahoma Statutes. However, Iams does not present 
those arguments in its current motion to dismiss (Doc. # 89); therefore, the Court assumes that Iams is no longer pursuing its 
motion with regard to those statutes, and, accordingly, the Court will not address them. During a telephone conference between Court and counsel, held on March 24, 1992, counsel for Iams advised this Court that his 
Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss was still viable with regard to the Defendants' claims under § 3 of the Clayton Act and Title 79, § 
1, of the Oklahoma statutes. The Court will address the merits of this motion in a subsequent entry."
696,16," That case arose after Nu-Car, a competitor of Dunn & Mavis, entered into a contract with Chrysler to be the exclusive 
transporter of Chrysler's cars at its Warren, Michigan, manufacturing facility. Previously, Dunn & Mavis had the exclusive 
transportation contract with Chrysler. "
697,17," The Court also notes that Defendants allege that Iams is attempting to monopolize the super premium dog food market in 
Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas. However, Westway, a California partnership, alleges only that it does business in 
northern California. Therefore, it is difficult to see how an attempt to monopolize the super premium dog food market in 
Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas could affect Westway."
697,18," Of course, the person asserting the claim of attempting to monopolize must also establish the relevant product and geographic 
markets in which it competes with the alleged monopolizer.  Smith v. Northern Michigan Hospitals, Inc., 703 F.2d 942, 954 (6th 
Cir. 1983). Here, Defendants allege that super premium dog food is the product market and that Oklahoma, Arkansas, 
Louisiana, and Texas are the geographic market. Iams does not challenge these allegations, and the Court accepts same as 
true for purposes of ruling on Iams motion to dismiss. Parenthetically, the Court notes that Westway did not set forth either of 
these allegations. "
699,19," In concluding as a matter of law that the element of dangerous probability had not been met, the Richter court looked not only 
at the defendant's market share but also to the fact that its market share was declining."
699,20, Empire Gas was cited with approval by the Sixth Circuit in Richter and Langenderfer.
699,21," Iams is only the second largest participant in the super premium dog food market and has a market share which is less than 
50%. One would assume that competition with the firm which is the largest participant would be able to prevent Iams from 
controlling prices. Additionally, the product market upon which American Superior focuses is only a segment of the dog food 
market, the super premium portion. Therefore, there are possibly competitors in the other segments of the dog food market who 
do not now participate in the super premium end. Logic would dictate that if Iams were to attempt to charge a monopolist's price 
for its super premium dog food, these non-participants would quite possibly enter the super premium dog food market. 
Moreover, even if they did not enter the market, it is entirely reasonable to expect that consumers of super premium dog food 
would turn to premium dog food or even to just plain dog food. Thus, it is difficult to imagine how Iams could possess market 
strength which approaches monopoly power--the ability to control prices in the super premium dog food market and to exclude 
competition from it. However, as this case is now before the Court on a motion to dismiss, these speculative considerations are 
not properly a basis for the Court's decision on this motion at this time. "
707,1," For example, Pacific Express did not show that United offered predatory prices on its expanded service. In fact, the evidence 
shows that United's prices were higher than Pacific Express in the markets in which they competed. "
712,*," The Honorable Dolores K. Sloviter became Chief Judge on February 1, 1991."
712,**," The Honorable H. Lee Sarokin, United States District Judge for the District of New Jersey, sitting by designation. "
714,1," By exercising the delete option, which was in effect for model years 1980 to 1983, Chrysler buyers could specially order cars 
from the factory without a factory-installed sound system, and if they did so they would receive a credit against the base price of 
the car. "
715,2," Technically, section 3 of the Clayton Act is written to cover exclusive dealing contracts (contracts requiring the purchaser not to 
deal in the goods of a competitor of the seller), but Congress also intended to cover tying arrangements. A requirement that the 
buyer take another good of the seller means that the buyer may not deal with other sellers for that purchase. See IBM Corp. v 
United States, 298 U.S. 131, 137-38, 56 S Ct 701, 80 L. Ed. 1085 (1936)."
715,3," Chrysler says that if the case were to go to trial, it would argue that autos and autosound systems are not in fact distinct 
products, but instead part of one package. According to Chrysler, it only conceded this point for summary judgment purposes to 
avoid unnecessary lengthy discovery about its historical sales practices. In light of our disposition, the one versus two product 
issue becomes moot. "
716,4," Tying in competitive markets has long been common for promotional and other legitimate purposes. As the Supreme Court has 
repeatedly observed, package sales such as flour with sugar normally pose no antitrust concern, because if the seller ties the 
two products and does not offer a good deal, the customer in a competitive market can go elsewhere. See Jefferson Parish 
Hospital District No. 2 v Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 11-12, 104 S Ct 1551, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2 (1984) (""Jefferson Parish""). See also United 
States Steel Corp. v Fortner Enterprises, 429 U.S. 610, 622, 97 S Ct 861, 51 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1977) ("" Fortner II"") (using cheap 
financing to sell expensive housing does not by itself violate the antitrust laws). As we will suggest in Part III, however, economic 
harm in the tied product market may still be possible, though unlikely, when the tying product market is competitive."
716,5," Through full line forcing, a seller may homogenize heterogeneous demand and increase profits. For example, a movie 
distributor might own the exclusive rights to three films, and there might be three television stations wanting to rent the films. 
Station A expects its viewers to like Film 1 and would pay $ 5000 for it singly, but Station A doubts that its viewers would like 
Films 2 and 3, so would pay only $ 2500 for each singly. Station B thinks that Film 2 is worth $ 5000 but that the other two are 
worth only $ 2500 each. And similarly, Station C values Film 3 at $ 5000, but the first two at only $ 2500 each. If the distributor 
marketed each film individually, the market price would be $ 2500 each, but if the distributor could require the stations to rent all 
three together, the package price would be $ 10,000. No station would be forced to take an undesired package, but the 
distributor would make a larger profit by bundling. Demand homogenization can also reduce costs, resulting in savings which will inure in part to consumers' benefit. Most relevant 
to this case, automobile manufacturers have increasingly standardized or packaged options that were formerly purchased singly. 
They justify that practice in part because it reduces costs somewhat, but it could also increase automakers' profits in the short 
term (although not in the long term if the automobile market remains competitive). "
717,6," IBM Corp. v United States, 298 U.S. 131, 56 S Ct 701, 80 L. Ed. 1085 (1936), is frequently cited as such an example. In that 
case, IBM had a monopoly on card counting machines -- the forebear of modern computers. By charging a lot for cheap punch 
cards, IBM was able to vary the price for its system according to how intensively its customers used the machine, even though 
everyone paid the same low price for the machine. The Robinson-Patman Act does not condemn all price discrimination, of 
course, and many economists doubt the wisdom of prosecuting price discrimination. But price discrimination remains disfavored 
by the antitrust laws, which gives monopolists an incentive to effect it surreptitiously through tying."
717,7," Similarly, a seller might want to attribute income to one source rather than another in order to evade taxes, although in both the 
tax- and regulatory-evasion circumstances, it is hard to see the additional antitrust implications of the otherwise illegal conduct."
717,19," The other two prerequisites the concurring Justices would have imposed were ""a substantial threat that the tying seller will 
acquire market power in the tied-product market,"" id. at 38, and ""a coherent economic basis for treating the tying and tied 
products as distinct,"" id at 39. "
718,14," The parties appear to agree that the relevant geographic market is the entire United States, rather than any particular region. 
Neither party suggests that used cars belong in the market."
718,8," The Supreme Court itself has used quotation marks in referring to the ""per se"" rule against certain tie-ins, noting that ""tying may 
have procompetitive justifications that make it inappropriate to condemn without considerable market analysis."" NCAA v Board of 
Regents of the University of Oklahoma, 468 U.S. 85, 104 26, 104 S Ct 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1984)."
718,25," We decide this case on Chrysler's motion for summary judgment, not on the pleadings. If the plaintiffs believed that they have 
not had ample discovery to determine precisely how Chrysler's challenged practices are hurting them, then the proper approach 
would have been to file a motion under F.R.C.P. 56(f) identifying the additional documents needed. The plaintiffs have not done 
so. The plaintiffs do assert that they were denied discovery as to the profitability of Chrysler's autosound sales, but even if they 
had not waived the point by failing to file a Rule 56(f) motion, we do not see how the requested information (if available) could 
help them over the causation hurdle."
718,9," For the most recent comprehensive statement of this view, see generally 9 Areeda, Antitrust Law, especially para. para. 1703 
at 50-55, 1730 at 406-14. Beginning with the seminal article by Ward Bowman, Tying Arrangements and the Leverage Problem, 67 Yale L.J. 19 (1957), 
the critics have also questioned the leverage hypothesis. They ask why a monopolist would want to expand control over a 
complement as opposed to a competing substitute, which would in fact be an expansion in the same product market. Other 
writers, however, have demonstrated that some monopolists can in fact increase their profits by tying, and that in some 
instances consumers will be hurt on net. In any event, although courts have long had an aversion to tying, the modern economic 
and legal literature generally agrees that tie-ins need not be, though can be, anticompetitive. See generally Louis Kaplow, 
Extension of Monopoly Power Through Leverage, 85 Colum. L. Rev. 515 (1985). "
719,10," In Jefferson Parish, the most recent Supreme Court case covering a tying claim, a hospital had an exclusive dealing contract 
with a firm of anesthesiologists which provided that patients would receive anesthesiological services only from members of that 
firm while they were in the hospital. The plaintiff, an anesthesiologist but not a member of the firm, sued the hospital, claiming 
that the hospital had illegally tied hospital operating rooms to anesthesiological services. As discussed in the text, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the validity of the ""per se"" rule against tying but ruled that the tie-in there 
was not illegal ""per se."" According to the Court, anesthesiology and hospital services were separate products, but the hospital 
possessed insufficient power in the tying (hospital services) market to invoke the ""per se"" rule. As we will discuss in Part III, the 
Court also ruled that the plaintiff failed to show an unreasonable restraint on competition in the tied product market 
(anesthesiology), so that the plaintiff had no rule of reason claim either. "
720,11," To the extent that Digidyne Corp. v Data General Corp., 734 F2d 1336, 1339-41, 1344-46 (9th Cir. 1984), suggests that 
defining the tying product market is generally unnecessary on a ""per se"" claim because power over a portion of that market 
(there, ""locked in"" purchasers of system software) is sufficient, we disagree with it. That may have been the Court's view in 
Fortner I, 394 U.S. at 502-04, but the Court retreated from this position in Fortner II and Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 26-28. See 
also Data General Corp. v Digidyne Corp., 473 U.S. 908, 908-09, 105 S Ct 3534, 87 L. Ed. 2d 657 (1985) (White, joined by 
Blackmun, dissenting from denial of certiorari) (questioning the Ninth Circuit's opinion for this and other reasons, including the 
opinion's presumption that a copyright confers market power and its conclusion that power to force is established by a 
demonstration that some buyers find the tying product uniquely desirable)."
720,12," More precisely, the plaintiffs, not Chrysler, shoulder the burden of defining the relevant tying product market. HN4[
] To win 
summary judgment on the ""per se"" theory, a defendant need only show that the plaintiff has failed to make any showing that the 
defendant has power in an economically and legally relevant tied product market. When opposing Chrysler's summary judgment 
motion, the plaintiffs must tell us the facts that they wish to prove at trial. If their sole proffered definition of the tying product 
market is wholly implausible, they have no triable ""per se"" case, whether or not Chrysler's definition is indisputable. For present 
purposes, however, that fine point does not matter. We easily conclude that the tying product market includes not only Chrysler-
manufactured cars sold in the United States, but also all new automobiles competing with those cars (precisely the market 
definition that Chrysler proposes), and that Chrysler has no power over prices in that market."
720,13," Market definition (product or geographical) always involves the difficult task of line drawing, so that the two-step process of (1) 
market definition and (2) determination of power therein is unavoidably somewhat artificial. The important question for present 
purposes is the ultimate one: whether Chrysler has power over pricing its cars, such that we must presume (under the logic of 
the ""per se"" rule) that it is exploiting its leverage in the autosound market. "
721,15," The plaintiffs do cite several old cases that viewed trademarks as creating presumptions of market power. But modern courts 
and commentators reject this position. See, for example, Grappone v Subaru of New England, 858 F2d 792, 796-97 (1st Cir. 
1988) (almost all sellers of branded products have some loyal customers, but this alone is insufficient to prove market power for 
purposes of the ""per se"" rule); Phillip E. Areeda and Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law para. 511.1 at 488-89 (1991 Supp.) and 
cases cited therein."
721,16," The plaintiffs offer no creditable evidence to the contrary. Their only submission that is even arguably relevant to this issue is 
an affidavit by their expert, Dr. F. Gerard Adams, who simply concluded that the market alleged by the plaintiffs in their complaint 
is proper. In our view, Dr. Adams was merely agreeing with the plaintiffs' definition of the tied product market; nowhere does he 
specifically say anything about the tying product market or explain how Chryslers do not in fact compete with other cars. The 
documents that his affidavit cross-references relate to the autosound market, not the automobile market. Even if we believed 
that Dr. Adams meant to approve of the plaintiffs' definitions of both tying and tied product markets, his affidavit would be 
insufficient to raise a triable issue of fact. For purposes of tying product market definition, it is wholly conclusory and sets forth no 
specific facts or reasoning and therefore cannot defeat summary judgment. See F.R.C.P. 56(e); Lujan v National Wildlife 
Federation, 497 U.S. 871, 110 S Ct 3177, 3188, 111 L. Ed. 2d 695 (1990). "
722,17," Although courts can also infer market power from direct evidence of sustained supranormal profits rather than indirectly from 
evidence of market shares, the plaintiffs have offered no such evidence here. The plaintiffs complain that they have been denied 
discovery as to the profitability of Chrysler's autosound sales, but evidence of Chrysler's overall profitability from automobile 
sales is easily available from public sources and, not surprisingly, the plaintiffs have declined to introduce it. "
723,18," We need not detail the prerequisites that are clear from the applicable statutes and are not at issue here. For example, a 
prerequisite to all Sherman Act claims is an effect on interstate or international commerce, but both parties agree that Chrysler's 
actions have an effect on interstate commerce."
723,20," The concurrence also suggested that tying might be undesirable if it serves as a means to evade regulatory price controls or if 
it enables the seller to engage in price discrimination by metering demand.  Id at 37 n. 4. The former theory does not require 
market power, and Justice O'Connor had no reason to endorse or reject a market power requirement in general in Jefferson 
Parish. Thus Chrysler arguably overstates the views of the concurring Justices as well as the majority. "
724,21," Chrysler suggests that Justice Stevens's next paragraph effectively negated the sentence quoted in the text. That paragraph 
reads, in its entirety: In sum, any inquiry into the validity of a tying arrangement must focus on the market or markets in which the two products are 
sold, for that is where the anticompetitive forcing has its impact. Thus, in this case our analysis of the tying issue must focus on 
the hospital's sale of services to its patients, rather than its contractual arrangements with the providers of anesthesiological 
services. In making that analysis, we must consider whether petitioners are selling two separate products that may be tied 
together, and, if so, whether they have used their market power to force their patients to accept the tying arrangement."
724,466," U.S. at 18. Chrysler says that because the first sentence discusses ""any inquiry into the validity of a tying arrangement,"" the 
entire paragraph also covers rule of reason claims, and that the last phrase shows that the majority still requires a showing of 
power in the tying product market in rule of reason claims. Although that argument seems powerful, it ignores the beginning of the second sentence, which indicates that the Court was 
talking about what its inquiry in that case would involve. In Jefferson Parish, the primary issue was the ""per se"" claim, so of 
course the Court had to consider tying market power. The issue is not free from doubt, but we are reluctant to read that 
paragraph (or, as explained in the text, the entire majority opinion) as insisting on a showing of tying market power when making 
a rule of reason claim. "
725,22," In several other cases not relied on by Chrysler for this proposition, courts of appeals have generically described the 
requirements for demonstrating an illegal tying claim as including tying market power. See Xeta, Inc. v Atex, Inc., 852 F2d 1280, 
1282-83 (Fed Cir. 1988); Wells Real Estate, Inc. v Greater Lowell Board of Realtors, 850 F2d 803, 814 (1st Cir. 1988); Will v 
Comprehensive Accounting Corp., 776 F2d 665, 670-74 (7th Cir. 1985); Jack Walters & Sons Corp. v Morton Building, Inc., 737 
F2d 698, 702 (7th Cir. 1984). But those cases do not distinguish between ""per se"" and rule of reason claims and may only have 
meant to cover ""per se"" claims. These cases merely cite the ""per se"" portions of Jefferson Parish and do not explain how, if their 
holdings do cover rule of reason claims, those holdings are consistent with the words and deeds of the Jefferson Parish majority 
when specifically considering the rule of reason claim there."
725,23," The economic (as opposed to legal precedential) soundness of a requirement of tying market power for a rule of reason claim 
is a matter of academic debate. Some commentators agree with the concurring Justices in Jefferson Parish. See, for example, 
Herbert Hovenkamp, Economics and Federal Antitrust Law § 8.3 at 217-19 (1985) (tying arrangement in competitive market 
can cause no harm because seller cannot impose unwanted second product without compensating buyer; hence tie-in must be 
""efficiency-creating""). Most of the work of ""Chicago School"" theorists has centered on the general proposition that significant 
economic harm cannot occur (and hence the antitrust laws should not interfere) in competitive markets. See, for example, Frank 
H. Easterbrook, The Limits of Antitrust, 63 Tex. L. Rev. 1, 20-21 (1984) (""Firms that lack [market] power cannot injure 
competition no matter how hard they try.""). "
726,," But other commentators, for varying reasons, suggest that economic harm from tie-ins is possible, although not probable, where 
the tying product market is competitive. See 9 Phillip E. Areeda, Antitrust Law para. para. 1728b at 369-70, 1728d at 371-72, 
1729 at 375-406 (1991) (harm from foreclosure of substantial share of concentrated tied product market still possible without 
power in tying product market); Richard Craswell, Tying Requirements in Competitive Markets: The Consumer Protection 
Issues, 62 B.U. L. Rev. 661 (1982) (tie-ins in competitive markets may be linked to market failures caused by imperfect 
information, although antitrust laws may not be the best solution to this consumer protection problem); W. David Slawson, 
Excluding Competition Without Monopoly Power: The Use of Tying Arrangements to Exploit Market Failure, 36 Antitrust Bull. 
457 (1991) (favoring broader ""per se"" rule, even where seller has no power in tying product market, but with expansive 
affirmative defenses). Because we believe that we are bound by Jefferson Parish unless and until the Court changes its mind, we need not take sides 
in this debate."
726,24," The plaintiffs claim that the ""synergy"" between Chrysler's eleven percent share of the automobile market, some customers' 
loyalty, and Chrysler's trademarks creates a triable issue over whether Chrysler can exploit those factors to ""force"" sales of 
unwanted radios -- under the rule of reason, even if not under the ""per se"" rule. In our view, on these facts at least, the power 
extension theory is no more triable under the rule of reason than it is under the ""per se"" rule. Of course, tying market power is not a binary issue (present or not present), but a question of degree. Perhaps, as both sides 
have at times suggested, the minimum power threshold for a leverage-based rule of reason claim should be lower than for a ""per 
se"" claim. Justice Stevens's ""kind or degree"" language in Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 18 (quoted at    ), certainly supports that 
interpretation. But in practice, although economists use indices, market power is difficult to measure with precision. At all events, here the plaintiffs have no reasonable argument that Chrysler has any significant leverage from the automobile 
market. Thus, although in theory there may be cases in which the plaintiffs can proceed on a leverage-based theory under the 
rule of reason but not under the ""per se"" rule, this is not a case that requires us to venture onto the slippery slope of market 
power quantification. "
727,26," As we discuss below, this is so whether or not the buyers know the underlying prices for each component: if the package is 
not worth the package price, or another manufacturer's package is a better deal on net, the car buyer will offer less or go 
elsewhere. We consider buyers who fail to consider autosound systems when buying their cars in the next subsection. "
728,27," According to the plaintiffs' consumer survey, only 43.3 percent of buyers of Chrysler cars bought the type of autosound 
equipment that was on their cars because they wanted it beforehand, and only 15.4 percent specifically preferred Chrysler's 
brand of autosound equipment."
728,28," Others would not, for at least two reasons. First, they may not know how well options will fit together. Second, due to 
production efficiencies, installing individual preferences is more expensive than installing a standard options package. "
729,29," The plaintiffs also offer evidence that some consumers do consider autosound systems (and hence are not surprised), but 
consider them as only a secondary factor. For these consumers, the autosound system matters but will rarely be a deal-breaker 
by itself, again because it is a small fraction of the total price. But for them, the argument of the last section applies: nothing 
prevents these consumers from going elsewhere. Chrysler may force them to compromise, but it cannot force them to accept an 
inferior package at an inflated price, which is the concern of the antitrust laws. "
730,30," In another portion of the opinion, which we discussed in the previous subsection, Justice Stevens did write that ""tying 
arrangements need only be condemned if they restrain competition on the merits by forcing purchases that would not otherwise 
be made. A lack of price or quality competition does not create this type of forcing."" 466 U.S. at 27-28. Out of context, that 
statement seems to say that a tying arrangement's inhibition of price and quality competition is not, of itself, an antitrust concern 
-- which is in tension with the passages we have quoted in the text. But the remainder of the discussion there shows that the 
Court was talking about consumer inability to evaluate anesthesiological services -- a preexisting and continuing problem of 
price and quality competition. The quality of an autosound system is less difficult to judge than the caliber of an anesthesiologist. 
No doubt Chrysler buyers can evaluate the price and quality of autosound systems, although, as the plaintiffs have shown, they 
often choose not to. The claim here is that the tie-in has induced a market failure, not merely taken advantage of an existing one, 
and Jefferson Parish neither rules out nor rules in such claims."
730,31," Professor Craswell's article also contains discussions of the problems of surprise and opportunism.  62 B.U. L. Rev. at 672-75. 
His discussion of surprise focuses on the problem of buyer misperception. For example, when a buyer buys a photocopier and 
commits to purchasing the same manufacturer's paper, the buyer may misestimate the amount of paper that will be needed and 
hence the cost of the package, or it may simply misunderstand its commitment. Automobile purchases, however, are one-shot 
deals that require no complex estimation of future purchases; their greatest complexity is usually the financing, which is not at 
issue here. Similarly, Professor Craswell's discussion of opportunism, which focuses on the problem of locked-in buyers, is not 
applicable here. "
731,32," Car buyers might want to know the price and dealer cost of each option to determine the dealer's margin, which might help 
them in bargaining with the dealer. Of course, they would be just as well off knowing the total dealer cost for each car, which 
they could compare with the total price offered. But neither the antitrust laws (nor, as far as we are aware, consumer protection 
statutes) require sellers to advise consumers of their mark-ups. At all events, outlawing Chrysler's tying practices would only 
reveal itemized prices, not itemized costs, which would not help consumers in bargaining."
731,33," If the plaintiffs' claim is instead that itemized pricing will spur consumers to consider alternative suppliers for each component, 
it has two problems. First, it proves too much: the same argument would apply to every component of a car, whether currently 
denominated an option (such as an airbag on most cars) or standard equipment (such as windshield wipers). Second, and more 
basically, while spurring consumers to comparison shop may be a worthy societal goal, that is not Chrysler's duty under the 
antitrust laws. Some legislators may want to require itemized pricing for automobiles just as some locales now require unit 
pricing in supermarkets, but we cannot read such a requirement into the antitrust laws. "
732,34," Actions creating or exacerbating problems of imperfect information could be seen as ""restraining trade"" or ""substantially 
lessening competition"" even though not leading to monopoly or oligopoly. "
733,35," Chrysler has conceded that its practices affect a substantial amount of commerce. We do not read that concession, however, 
as an acknowledgement that Chrysler has foreclosed such a substantial portion of the tied product market to hurt competition. 
Chrysler's briefs vigorously deny that it has power in a properly defined tied product market, and Chrysler submits that as a 
result there is no way that it could appreciably restrain competition in that market."
733,36," That not all Ford and GM sound systems may physically fit into Chrysler dashboard slots is irrelevant to the process of market 
definition. The real question is whether the systems compete with each other. For someone who has already decided to buy a 
Chrysler, it is true that a Ford-installed sound system may not compete with a Chrysler- or aftermarket-supplied sound system 
because the Ford system would be too big to fit. But the question of fit only matters if automobile buyers are locked into buying 
Chryslers, which is simply not true."
733,37," The plaintiffs argue that Chrysler's practice is motivated by its greater profits on sound systems that it manufactures itself. 
Even if we assume that this is true (which is by no means obvious as a matter of economic theory), if Chrysler also were totally 
insulated from competition with respect to autosound systems, it would make no sense for Chrysler to continue to purchase any 
sound systems from other manufacturers. Thus one or both of the plaintiffs' two premises must be false."
733,38," At all events, the plaintiffs, not Chrysler, bear the burden of defining a relevant tied product market for purposes of this theory. 
Even if we were to agree that Chrysler's broad definition of the tied product market was disputable, certainly the plaintiffs are not 
entitled to go to trial with their Chrysler-only definition of the tied product market. The plaintiffs' definition is patently invalid. "
734,39," The plaintiffs requested but did not obtain discovery of the profitability of Chrysler's autosound sales, information which would 
be relevant to Chrysler's ability to sustain supranormal profits from autosound sales (that is, power in the autosound market). 
Once again, however, if the plaintiffs felt that this discovery was necessary for them to defeat Chrysler's motion for summary 
judgment, it was incumbent on them to file a Rule 56(f) affidavit. They did not do so, and therefore cannot complain now. See 
Dowling v City of Philadelphia, 855 F2d 136, 139-40 (3d Cir. 1988)."
734,40," The plaintiffs have also asked that this court take notice that Chrysler's practice of standardizing autosound systems is 
becoming prevalent across the automotive industry. That standardization, they suggest, will ultimately doom the entire 
autosound aftermarket industry because aftermarket sellers will not enter the automobile market in order to sell their audio 
wares. Chrysler has admitted that Ford and GM are undertaking similar standardization programs. The Big Three American 
automakers, however, only account for about half of the American automobile market. Asian and European manufacturers have 
made large inroads into the American car market, and the plaintiffs have not introduced into the record any information about 
foreign manufacturers' practices. We do not believe that this is the type of fact of which federal courts may take judicial notice under Federal Rule of Evidence 
201(b). Actually, Chrysler suggested at oral argument that the foreign manufacturers are not following the American practice. But 
this fact is not generally known and we have not independently confirmed it, nor could we easily do so. Whatever the truth may 
be, we cannot credit the plaintiffs' arguments to the extent that they are based on industry-wide practices. Moreover, even if we assumed that soon every automobile manufacturer will include an autosound system on every car, the 
most that we could conclude would be that a certain class of competitors (namely the autosound aftermarket dealers) might be 
doomed to competitive oblivion. But that would be no concern of the antitrust laws unless consumers were also hurt because of 
diminished competition. See Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 488 (antitrust laws serve to protect competition, not competitors). If the 
autosound aftermarket were to disappear, vigorous competition in the automobile market would remain. That competition would 
protect those consumers who care about autosound systems no less than it now protects consumers who care about other 
standard features, including the comfort of the front seats, the quality of the brakes, and the fuel efficiency of the engine. If the plaintiffs alleged actual or tacit collusion among automobile manufacturers with respect to standardization, that would be a 
serious antitrust concern. But the plaintiffs do not. If the autosound aftermarket industry wants protection from auto 
manufacturers' supposedly widening yet noncollusive standardization practices, it should seek relief from the Congress, not from 
the federal courts whose duty it is to adjudicate antitrust claims. "
735,41," The language in Times-Picayune, although part of an extended discussion, is doubly dictum because (1) the case did not 
involve a claim under section 3 of the Clayton Act, and (2) the decision turned on whether the morning and afternoon 
newspapers were one product, hence whether there was a tie-in at all. Because the Court has never stated this position in a 
holding, technically it does not bind us. Generally, however, we consider and respect Supreme Court dicta as well as holdings 
because the Supreme Court hears relatively few cases and frequently uses dicta to give guidance to the lower courts. Of course, 
at the time of Times-Picayune, antitrust cases were directly appealable to the Supreme Court, so perhaps we could dismiss the 
language as ""mere"" dictum, but it was carefully considered dictum and we prefer to tackle the plaintiffs' argument head on and 
not dispose of it on that tenuous ground."
735,42," Actually, the dual-standard position that the Court endorsed in Times-Picayune may not have survived the intervening years. 
The Court has not faced a claim under section 3 of the Clayton Act since Times-Picayune, so not surprisingly it has not explicitly 
either reaffirmed or backed off from the language at issue. Nevertheless, we are inclined to agree with Professor Areeda, among 
others, that the standards for illegality of tying arrangement under the Sherman and Clayton Acts have coalesced. See 9 
Areeda, Antitrust Law para. 1719b at 254-57 (citing cases and noting arguments for differing standards based on precedent, 
legislative history, and general principles of statutory interpretation, but persuasively rejecting each). See also 2 Areeda and 
Turner, Antitrust Law para. 304 at 6-9."
735,43," The plaintiffs rely heavily on the legislative history of the Clayton Act, but the legislative history of that act is a complicated one. 
See 2 & 3 Earl W. Kintner, ed. The Legislative History of the Federal Antitrust Laws and Related Statutes (Clark Boardman, 
1978). Some members of Congress sought to clarify and expand the scope of antitrust liability under the Sherman Act, which 
was murky after the promulgation of the rule of reason in Standard Oil Co. v United States, 221 U.S. 1, 31 S Ct 502, 55 L. Ed. 
619 (1911). Others sought to rein in their colleagues by insisting on the qualifier requiring a substantial lessening of competition 
or the tendency to create a monopoly. Because one can find choice statements in the voluminous legislative history of this 
statute to support almost any interpretation, we prefer to focus on the compromise language eventually hammered out. "
737,1," The majority focuses on the effects rather than the purpose of Chrysler's tie, although there is evidence that suggests that 
Chrysler was targeting its competitors in the aftermarket installation. An internal Chrysler memorandum in 1983 by a 
departmental specialist to the manager of Options and Mix Merchandising stated, ""we will support product planning's proposal to "
738,," make radios standard on everything. . . . Our field force should have ample reason to force our radios in place of aftermarket 
installations."" App. at 301 (emphasis added)."
738,2," The majority appears to credit Chrysler's suggestion made at oral argument that the foreign manufacturers are not following the 
American tying practice. See Majority Typescript Op. at 61-62 n.40. If the majority had permitted this case to proceed to an 
inquiry into actual competitive effects, it might have been relatively easy for plaintiffs to establish that, in fact, many of Chrysler's 
foreign competitors are engaging in similar tying practices. See, e.g., Five Compacts Sedans, Consumer Reps., March 1990, at 
199 (noting that Honda Accord LX, Nissan Stanza GXE, and Subaru Legacy LS all include stereos as standard equipment)."
738,3," The interconnection between demand for the tying product and the tied product is one of the distinguishing factors between this 
situation and the flour/sugar hypothetical discussed in Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 12, where the demand for the two goods is 
independently derived. "
740,4," Similarly, foreclosure of part of the market occupied by independents also may injure consumers in their pocketbooks. As a 
general matter, in an oligopolistic market ""ties narrowing the volume of orders potentially available to rivals lower their possible 
gains from price cutting. In turn, reducing their incentive for price competition diminishes its likelihood, thereby helping stabilize 
non-competitive oligopoly pricing."" 9 Phillip E. Areeda, Antitrust Law para. 1707c, at 80-81 (1991). Thus, such a tying practice 
may also discourage aftermarket sellers from engaging in vigorous price competition (an anticompetitive effect). "
741,5," Although the majority does not accept plaintiffs' argument that the district court erred in failing to require Chrysler to produce 
documents relating to the profitability of its radio sales, I would not discount the relationship of such evidence to an inquiry into 
effect on competition in the tied product market."
741,6," A consumer survey presented by plaintiffs reported that 13.4 percent of Chrysler buyers would have preferred to choose a 
different brand or type of radio than that supplied with their cars, App. at 579, and 20.8 percent would have preferred to have 
had the option to purchase a car without its accompanying automotive sound equipment, id. at 584."
741,7," It is significant that unlike flour and sugar, items of relatively equal value, there is evidence in this case that the typical 
consumer has already decided to purchase a particular brand of automobile, a major decision, before considering the relatively 
minor decision regarding preferences as to a car radio. There is evidence that only 1.6% of the Chrysler buyers decided not to 
buy a particular car because the desired automotive sound equipment was not available. The figure for buyers of cars generally 
was 2.4%. App. at 581. This court has previously expressed concern that a minor decision may be insulated from the 
competitive pressures of the marketplace due to the nature of an accompanying major decision and the order in which the 
decisions are typically made by consumers. See Weiss, 745 F.2d at 826 (jury could reasonably have concluded that a consumer 
of hospital services makes one purchase decision and that further decisions concerning his treatment are relatively insulated 
from competition). Thus, the normal market pressures from competition, which are expected when one sells independent 
products together, such as flour and sugar, and which, at least theoretically, protect against monopoly profits and inferior 
products, may not be operating in the tied product market here. "
749,1," Plaintiff petitioned a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent injunction. "
753,2," The parties stipulated the 1991 Agreement into evidence. Defendant, however, objected to the 1986 Agreement and the UCI 
registration. The Court, however, finds that there is no prejudice to defendant in considering these documents as they only 
support defendant's factual contention that VMG and UCI agreed to a territorial trademark division for the BABY'S CHOICE 
mark. Admission of these documents in no way adds or detracts from the merits vel non of defendant's antitrust contentions 
which, by defendant's own admission, turn upon a question of law. "
754,3," We say ""may"" because, while the Court in Beatrice Foods considered it the first time, the same Court in Holiday Inn, 534 F.2d 
at 314, suggested that Beatrice Foods was the second case dealing with the statute and, that Silber v. Bullseye Corp., 45 
C.C.P.A. 906, 254 F.2d 405 (C.C.P.A. 1958) was the first. "
756,4," The case relied on by defendant, Phi Delta Theta Fraternity v. J. A. Buchroeder & Co., 251 F. Supp. 968 (W.D. Mo. 1966), 
actually refers to a denial of plaintiff's motions for summary judgment and for dismissal of defendant's antitrust counterclaims, 
based on facts stipulated for purposes of the motions. The Court was careful to point out that the counterclaims survived the 
motions under the stipulated facts, and that the antitrust violations, if proven at trial, would provide the basis for treble damages 
and injunctive relief.  Id. at 974. Thus, Phi Delta is not a decision on the actual merits of the antitrust counterclaims. "
762,5, Plaintiff shall file a verified petition for attorney's fees within fifteen (15) days after conclusion of the hearing on damages.
762,6, Plaintiff shall file a Bill of Costs within fifteen (15) days after conclusion of the hearing on damages. 
767,1," This court previously dismissed Counts I, II and III of plaintiffs' complaint.  Five Smiths, Inc. v. National Football League Players 
Ass'n, No. 4-90-261 (D. Minn. June 27, 1991). "
768,2," See generally Thomas A. Piraino, Jr., Reconciling the Per Se and Rule of Reason Approaches to Antitrust Analysis, 64 S. Cal. 
L. Rev. 685 (1991) (discussing difficulty in determining which approach should apply and arguing that courts should analyze 
section 1 conduct on a continuum)."
768,3," Defendant concedes, for purposes of this motion, that such an agreement exists. "
769,4," Examples of such per se violations include horizontal price-fixing agreements, see Federal Trade Comm'n v. Superior Court 
Trial Lawyers Ass'n, 493 U.S. 411, 436, 107 L. Ed. 2d 851, 110 S. Ct. 768 n.19 (1990) (such conspiracies have been 
""consistently analyzed"" as per se violations); vertical restraints that include ""some agreement on price or price levels."" Business 
Elec. Corp. v. Sharp Elec. Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 735-36, 108 S. Ct. 1515, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1988); horizontal agreements to 
divide territory, see, e.g., United States v. Topco Assoc., 405 U.S. 596, 608, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515, 92 S. Ct. 1126 (1972); and certain 
types of tying arrangements, see, e.g., Northern Pac. Ry., 356 U.S. at 5-6. "
771,5," Plaintiffs attempt to supplement their complaint with their brief in opposition to defendant's motion to dismiss, arguing that any 
acts of the NFLPA are sufficient to satisfy the concerted action requirement because the NFLPA is a ""voluntary association of 
competing agents and players."" The court did not consider plaintiffs' brief in evaluating the sufficiency of their complaint.  See 
infra note 8; Car Carriers, Inc., 745 F.2d at 1107. The court notes, however, that plaintiffs' position is not supported by the law.  A 
trade association is not a ""walking conspiracy"" of its members.  See, e.g., Consolidated Metal Prods. v. American Petroleum 
Inst., 846 F.2d 284, 293-94 & n.30 (5th Cir. 1988)(when analyzing activities of a trade association ""the mere showing of 
relationships between alleged conspirators is insufficient to imply a conspiracy""); accord Wilk v. American Medical Ass'n, 895 
F.2d 352, 374 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 112 L. Ed. 2d 524, 111 S. Ct. 513 (1990). Thus, ""the mere exchange of information, or 
even consciously parallel action, is insufficient to establish a conspiracy [involving members of a trade association] under section 
1."" Consolidated Metal Prod., 846 F.2d at 294 n.30. "
772,6," The court further notes that every circuit court evaluating plaintiffs' player restraints has concluded that such conduct is not per 
se illegal but should instead be analyzed under the rule of reason. E.g., Smith v. Pro Football Inc., 593 F.2d at 1181-82 (""the 
legality of the NFL draft should not be governed by a per se rule""); Mackey v. National Football League, 543 F.2d 606, 619 (8th 
Cir. 1976) (""the unique nature of the business of professional football renders it inappropriate to mechanically apply per se 
illegality rules""), cert. dismissed, 434 U.S. 801, 98 S. Ct. 28, 54 L. Ed. 2d 59 (1977). If plaintiffs' restraints, which operate in an 
atmosphere in which they have almost totally eliminated player competition and in which they have been found to have 
monopoly power, see United States Football League v. National Football League, 842 F.2d 1335, 1341 (2d Cir. 1988), are to be 
judged by the rule of reason, the court concludes that any antitrust claims based on actions by the players, their agents or the 
NFLPA must surely fall into the category of conduct properly judged by the rule of reason. In National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Oklahoma, the Supreme Court similarly determined that 
because intercollegiate amateur athletics are ""an industry in which horizontal restraints on competition are essential if the 
product is to be available at all"", 468 U.S. at 101, the National Collegiate Athletic Association's television plan, which operated as 
a horizontal price-fixing agreement, should nonetheless be analyzed under the rule of reason rather than the per se rule. Id. at 
100-04."
772,7," Because plaintiffs can demonstrate no anticompetitive effect as a result the lack of competition between players for positions 
and also the absence of competition between plaintiffs for player services, the court further determines that any such claim fails 
to state a rule of reason violation.  See infra. "
773,8," A Rule 12(b)(6) motion tests the sufficiency of a claim as pled: thus, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6), the court's inquiry essentially is limited to the content of the complaint. . . ."
773,5," A Charles A. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure § 1356, at 298 (1990); see, e.g., Biesenbach v. Guenther, 
588 F.2d 400, 402 (3d Cir. 1978) (when confronted with a motion to dismiss, the court limits its consideration to the allegations in 
the complaint).  Rule 12(b)(6) provides, however, that if: matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for 
summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  In the present case, the court limited its inquiry to the allegations contained in plaintiffs' complaint and 
thus did not treat defendant's motion as one for summary judgment."
773,9," For example, plaintiffs quote deposition testimony from agents reflecting their general belief that access to player compensation 
information helps players to negotiate contracts more favorable than they would otherwise be able to negotiate in the absence of 
such information and that the NFLPA encourages the exchange for that purpose.  Even if added to plaintiffs' complaint, however, 
such allegations do not constitute evidence of an agreement to fix prices. Moreover, the agents also testified that they did not 
agree with the NFLPA or with other agents to do anything other than exchange salary information, thus undercutting plaintiffs' 
contention that there is a broader conspiracy to fix players' salaries. Plaintiffs also proffer an NFLPA document that allegedly sets forth benchmark salaries for 1990 draftees, arguing that the 
document evidences a price-fixing agreement.  That document, however, indicates on its face that it was for internal NFLPA use 
only and was not to be provided to agents or players. Also absent from either the complaint or plaintiffs' evidentiary submissions 
are any facts indicating that any agent agreed to adhere to such benchmarks, that the NFLPA had the power to enforce such 
recommendations or that acts in conformity with such advice would have been contrary to the agent's economic self-interest.  
The court thus determines that the proffered document fails to support a price-fixing conspiracy. Plaintiffs also assert that a provision of the NFLPA voluntary code of conduct, under which member agents agree to provide 
compensation information to the NFLPA, indicates coercion by the NFLPA, thus supporting their allegation of the existence of a 
broader price-fixing conspiracy. As the court previously determined, however, such an exchange of salary information, without 
more, does not constitute a per se violation of the Sherman Act. Plaintiffs also submit deposition testimony which they contend 
indicates that agents cooperate in other ways in addition to the exchange of basic salary data.  Even if the testimony supports 
such assertions, however, that evidence does not support the allegation of price fixing by the NFLPA. Plaintiffs finally cite to a newspaper article concerning the progress of contract negotiations between Lamar Lathon and the 
Houston Oilers.  However, Gene Upshaw and Lathon's agent both denied the contents of that article under oath.  Thus, that 
evidence does not support either the existence of a price-fixing agreement or any claim that the NFLPA or Gene Upshaw were 
actually in control of those negotiations. Thus, the court concludes that even if it were to treat plaintiffs' evidentiary submission as a motion for leave to amend, plaintiffs 
proffer no evidence that would cure the fundamental defects of their complaint.  Cf.  Car Carriers, Inc., 745 F.2d at 1106 
(complaint properly dismissed when there is no reasonable likelihood that the plaintiff can state a claim based on the allegations 
contained in the complaint). "
774,10," Plaintiffs fail to allege that they are competitors or how competition has been injured by the exchange of salary information.  
Moreover, as previously noted, there is almost no competition between member teams for player services or between players for 
positions because of existing player restraints.  See Schwartz v. Jamesway Corp., 660 F. Supp. 138, 141 (E.D.N.Y. 
1987)(proper pleading of a rule of reason claim requires an allegation of ""an injury to competition among several competitors""). The court notes that plaintiffs' failure to allege that they are competitors or that there has been an injury to competition may 
reflect the position that they have taken in McNeil v. National Football League and other cases, that is, that they are not 
competitors but rather are the equivalent of a single economic entity, and thus are incapable of conspiring within the meaning of 
section 1 of the Sherman Act. See, e.g., Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Comm'n v. National Football League, 726 F.2d 1381, 
1387-90 (9th Cir. 1984)(upholding district court's rejection of League's position that they operate as a single entity and are thus 
incapable of violating section 1), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 990, 105 S. Ct. 397, 83 L. Ed. 2d 331 (1984); Memorandum in Support of 
Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment at 1-4, McNeil v. National Football League, 777 F. Supp. 1475 (D. Minn. 1991)."
774,11," The court further rejects plaintiffs' attempt to evade that requirement by arguing that they do not need to plead a relevant 
market in a ""price-fixing"" case.  A properly pled price-fixing claim is generally subject to a per se analysis and thus does not 
require proof of an anticompetitive effect in a relevant market. But see National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n v. Board of Regents of 
Univ. of Oklahoma, 468 U.S. at 100-04 (analyzing plaintiff's television plan, which operated as a horizontal price-fixing 
agreement, under the rule of reason); Broadcast Music, Inc., 441 U.S. at 18-24 (applying rule of reason to horizontal price-fixing 
agreement).  However, to the extent that plaintiffs seek to assert a rule of reason claim, that claim requires that a relevant market 
is pled.  See Havoco of America, Ltd. v. Shell Oil Co., 626 F.2d 549, 555 (7th Cir. 1980) (""the absence of a sufficient allegation 
of anticompetitive effects in a Sherman Act complaint is fatal to the existence of a cause of action. . . .  The only exception to the 
requirement of an allegation of anticompetitive effects in a Section 1 Sherman Act complaint occurs in the narrow category of per 
se cases."") The court further rejects plaintiffs' reliance on Federal Trade Comm'n v. Superior Court Trial Lawyers Ass'n, 493 U.S. 411, 107 
L. Ed. 2d 851, 110 S. Ct. 768 (1990), to support their contention that they are not required to plead a relevant market. That case 
is wholly inapposite because it involved no rule of reason claims: the Supreme Court specifically held that the per se rule 
governed defendants' group boycott and horizontal price-fixing arrangement.  See id. at 428-36 & n.19. As previously 
determined, however, in the present case plaintiffs' allegations fail to state a per se violation. "
775,12," If an exchange of price information also encompasses an agreement to fix prices, that conduct would be subject to the per se 
rule. Compare King & King Enters. v. Champlin Petroleum Co., 657 F.2d 1147, 1150-54 (10th Cir. 1981)(various anticompetitive 
practices, including an exchange of market and price information, when combined with an agreement to lower and then raise 
prices to force discounter out of business, demonstrated the existence of a per se illegal price-fixing conspiracy), cert. denied, 
454 U.S. 1164, 71 L. Ed. 2d 320, 102 S. Ct. 1038 (1982), with United States v. Citizens Southern Nat'l Bank, 422 U.S. at 113 
(""the dissemination of price information is not itself a per se violation of the Sherman Act"")."
775,13," The court further notes that any doubt about whether Container Corp. applied the per se rule or the rule of reason has 
subsequently been eliminated by the Supreme Court's favorable citation of Justice Fortas's concurring opinion in Container "
776,," Corp. as support for the proposition that ""the dissemination of price information is not itself a per se violation of the Sherman 
Act."" Citizens & Southern National Bank, 422 U.S. at 113; see also Battipaglia v. New York State Liquor Auth., 745 F.2d 166, 
175 (2d Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1027, 84 L. Ed. 2d 782, 105 S. Ct. 1393 (1985)."
776,14," The court further notes that the cases on which plaintiffs rely to support their contention all involve relevant markets that were 
indisputably concentrated.  See, e.g., Container Corp., 393 U.S. at 337 (""the corrugated container industry is dominated by 
relatively few sellers""); United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. at 457 (gypsum board industry characterized as ""oligopolistic""); In 
re Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings in Petroleum Prod. Antitrust Litig., 906 F.2d 432, 443-44 (9th Cir. 1990), cert denied, 111 S. 
Ct. 2274, 114 L. Ed. 2d 725 (1991)(number of significant rivals in the gasoline market was ""sufficiently small"" enough to raise 
antitrust concerns). None of the cases involve a situation like that in the present case, where the information sharing agreement occurs in a non-
concentrated market involving non-fungible products.  In the absence of such market concentration, information exchanges are 
inherently procompetitive. See L. Sullivan, Law of Antitrust, § 94, at 268 (1977)(""the wide and rapid dissemination of price and 
related information is one of the prerequisites for a competitive market)""."
776,15," As a result of plaintiffs' player restraints, specifically the college draft and the first refusal/compensation system, most players 
are also unable to compete with each other for the same position on the same team because they are bound to their assigned 
clubs for the duration of their careers."
776,16," The court concludes that the other cases on which plaintiffs rely in support of their contention that the alleged information 
sharing agreement between the NFLPA and player agents is sufficient to state an antitrust rule of reason claim are inapposite.  
In In re Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings in Petroleum Prod. Antitrust Litig., not only was the structure of the gasoline market 
well within the parameters set by the Supreme Court in Container Corp., but the exchange of price information was, when 
considered in conjunction with the fact that there was a uniform pattern of pricing among all competitors in the industry and no 
legitimate reason offered for the exchange, deemed to be sufficient to serve as evidence of a broader price-fixing agreement 
specifically alleged in that case.  906 F.2d at 441-57. In contrast, in the present case not only is the market structure the 
opposite of that in Container Corp., but there is also no allegation of specific facts to support plaintiffs' claim of a broader price-
fixing agreement. For similar reasons, the court concludes that the decision in Penne v. Greater Minneapolis Area Bd. of Realtors, 604 F.2d 1143 
(8th Cir. 1979), is inapposite.  That case involved a wide range of alleged collusive practices engaged in by plaintiffs' 
competitors, including ""punitive"" divisions of brokerage commissions, ""blacklisting"" discount brokers, and making deprecatory 
statements to plaintiff's customers, all of which were combined with a price-information sharing agreement as part of a broader 
anti-competitive scheme.  Id. at 1147-50. The court further concludes that King & King Enters. v. Champlin Petroleum Co., 657 
F.2d 1147 (10th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1164, 71 L. Ed. 2d 320, 102 S. Ct. 1038 (1982), is distinguishable because 
the exchange of marketing and price information challenged in that case was part of a broader scheme by plaintiff's competitors 
and suppliers to drive plaintiff, a price discounter, out of business by the use of numerous collusive practices, including threats, 
providing price allowances to enable plaintiff's competitors to sell below cost, raising and lowering competitors' prices, and 
withholding marketing information from plaintiff that was shared among plaintiff's competitors. Id. at 1150-54. "
786,1," By order dated September 12, 1990, this court granted in part and denied in part Ford Motor's motion to dismiss. The court 
specifically found that the two pricing programs at issue in this suit (the CPA and GPC programs discussed below) did not 
constitute vertical price fixing in violation of the Sherman Act. The court dismissed all of Plaintiff's Sherman Act claims with the 
exception of claims relating to transactions involving Ryder Truck Rental, Inc."
786,2," In June, 1990, during the pendency of this litigation, Capital Ford ceased operations and has not operated as a Ford 
Dealership since that time. Capital Ford's agreements with Ford Motor were formally terminated on March 21, 1991. "
787,3, The Sales and Service Agreement superseded a 1969 agreement entered into by the parties.
787,4," Other agreements between Capital Ford and Ford Motor include a ""Ford Truck Sales and Service Agreement,"" dated 
September 1, 1973, and a ""Foreign Vehicle Sales Agreement,"" dated April 26, 1976. Capital Ford has also entered into separate 
agreements with Ford Motor Credit Company relating to floor plan financing for Capital Ford's truck acquisitions."
787,5," Ford Motor maintains that it has had price assistance programs, in varying forms, for twenty-five years."
787,6," When the wholesale price discounts were granted to dealers selling to governmental entities, the program was called 
government price concession, or GPC. Functionally, the CPA and GPC programs were identical but were handled through 
different offices until 1990. Litchfield Depo., pp. 81-82."
787,7," The rainbow schedules set different levels of CPA/GPC depending on whether the transaction involved 1 truck, 2-4 trucks, or 5 
or more trucks. "
788,8," Plaintiffs point to evidence that shows increasing differences between wholesale published prices of Ford Motor heavy trucks 
and the retail market value of those trucks. The evidence shows that Ford Motor increased wholesale prices of its trucks 
throughout the mid-1980s so that by 1987, the wholesale prices of Ford Motor's trucks were more than 20% above the Producer 
Price Index, while the actual retail market value of those vehicles was 3% below the Produce Price Index. See Plaintiff's Depo. 
Ex. 69, p. 9486."
788,9," The evidence of record shows that by 1988, 100% of all Ford Motor trucks being sold received some level of discount under 
the CPA or GPC programs. Plaintiffs' Ex. 69, O'Donnell Depo., p. 71."
788,10," In addition, the court notes that the delay in obtaining the discovery from McNeilus is due, in large part, to the unsuccessful 
actions of Plaintiffs in attempting to subpoena McNeilus' records in this court rather than in Minnesota. See Order of September 
19, 1991."
788,11," The affidavits are submitted by John W. Craig, Hank Harley, Lou Mazure, David Minor, Fred Morton, Ken Nichols, Larry 
O'Connor, Thomas H. Reeves, Jerry Turnauer, Billy W. Witcher and Fred L. Yates. "
789,12," The request sought production of all written or recorded statements taken from or provided by any person concerning any of 
the issues or allegations in the litigation. Plaintiffs' initial response on May 5, 1991 indicated that they would produce these 
affidavits. See Plaintiffs' response to Ford Motor's third request for production of documents, No. 1. On June 19, 1991, however, 
Plaintiffs filed an amended response in which they refused to produce the affidavits on work-product grounds. "
790,13," Defendant Ford Motor originally removed the state court action to this court. On motion of the Plaintiffs, however, this court 
remanded the action to state court. Capital Ford Truck Sales, Inc. vs. Ford Motor Co., No. 1:90-cv-2062-ODE, slip op. at 4 (N.D. 
Ga. Jan. 4, 1991)."
790,14," In Meredith, the Supreme Court held that the district court below had a duty to exercise its jurisdiction because no case was 
then pending in state court and no other consideration weighed against the exercise of jurisdiction.  320 U.S. at 228. "
791,15," Even if the ""affected with a public interest test"" were applicable to determine the constitutionality of the statute under the due 
process clause of the Georgia Constitution, an additional issue would be raised regarding whether the automobile industry 
affects the public interest."
791,16," Defendant argues that this court should dismiss, rather than stay, Plaintiffs' Franchise Practices Act claims in the event of 
abstention. Defendant cites Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315, 87 L. Ed. 1424, 63 S. Ct. 1098 (1943) as support for this 
contention. This is not a case of Burford abstention in which ""federal intervention . . . would have a disruptive effect on the state's 
efforts to establish a coherent policy on a matter of substantial public concern."" 17A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward 
H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 4244 (2d ed. 1988). Under Meredith v. City of Winter Haven, 320 U.S. at 236, the 
court finds that the proper action in this case is to stay proceedings under counts two, six and seven. See also Albertson v. 
Millard, 345 U.S. at 244. "
793,17," Plaintiffs contend that Ford Motor inquired into dealer profit when awarding price assistance pursuant to the rainbow 
schedules. The record, however, does not support this contention. Ford Motor points to evidence indicating that no dealer profit 
inquiry occurred in connection with CPA/GPC requests involving rainbow schedules. O'Donnell Depo., p. 177. In response, 
Plaintiffs have adduced general evidence showing that dealership profits were restricted through the CPA/GPC program, but no 
specific evidence showing that Ford Motor inquired into dealer profit in granting rainbow price assistance. It is undisputed that a 
dealer profit inquiry was made on CPA/GPC appeals."
793,18," Of course, this is subject to certain antitrust requirements which are not applicable in the instant case. "
794,19," In addition, HN16[
] under antitrust law, a manufacturer may condition the lowering of prices on agreements from retailers to pass the lower prices on to consumers. See AAA Liquors, Inc v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 705 F.2d 1203 (10th Cir. 
1982). In AAA Liquors, the Tenth Circuit held that such conditional price discounts do not constitute ""coercion or pressure to 
maintain resale prices. . . ."" Id. at 1206."
794,20," Actually, Ford Motor argues that one would expect to find published prices in excess of actual selling prices in a highly 
competitive, capital goods market such as the heavy truck industry. In such an environment, manufacturers and distributors 
attempt to maintain high published prices to cover rising costs and to provide a high starting point for negotiations. In a market 
where capacity is in excess of demand, Defendant argues that end-user customers demand and receive deep discounts from 
published prices. See Lewis Service Center, Inc. v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 714 F.2d 842 (8th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1226, 
81 L. Ed. 2d 873, 104 S. Ct. 2678 (1984). "
795,21," A body company is a manufacturing concern which adds a special use vehicle body, such as a school bus or cement mixer, 
to an unimproved heavy truck chassis and markets the improved product to end-user customers. "
798,22," It is unnecessary to reach Defendant's second argument, relating to competitive injury, with respect to this claim. "
799,23," Of course, the analysis would be different if Capital Ford had not been provided the same initial opportunity to enter into the 
State contract. See Bouldis v. U.S. Suzuki Motor Corp., 711 F.2d 1319, 1326 (6th Cir. 1983). Here, it is uncontested that Ford 
Motor offered the same GPC assistance to Capital Ford as it did to Peach State in connection with the 1989 bid for the State of 
Georgia contract. As such, the original arrangement between Peach Sate and Ford Motor was nondiscriminatory. "
800,24," The subject transactions are documented at the following tabbed appendices to the first affidavit of William Anderson: 1, 2, 4, 
9, 10, 11, 12, 19, 26, 28, 35, 36, 40, 41, 44, 46, 47, 51 53, 57-59, 61-64, 66-68, 73, 76, 77, 80-82, 85, 87, 90, 92, 93, 96 99, 107-
111, 116. "
801,25," Defendant does not argue that it is entitled to summary judgment on those transactions involving one, but not two, sales of 
trucks by Ford Motor. As such, the court does not reach the issue of whether these transactions fall within the Bruce's Juices 
exception to the two purchaser rule."
801,26," The subject transactions are documented at the following tabbed appendices to the first affidavit of William Anderson: 6, 34, 
65, 103, 105, 113, and 114."
801,27," The subject transactions are documented at the following tabbed appendices to the first affidavit of William Anderson: 7, 14, 
21, 22, 24, 31, 38, 42, 43, 49, 55, 71, 72, 78, 79, 86, 94, 100, 101, and 115. Defendant also challenges the transaction 
documented at tab 23, but does not specify the reason that Capital Ford and Peach State were not in actual competition with 
each other. In its reply brief, Defendant challenges six transactions (documented at tabs 8, 54, 69, 88, 112, and 117) in which it 
maintains that Capital Ford was the successful bidder, and thus sustained no antitrust injury and challenges a transaction 
involving a 1989 bid by Capital Ford and two other Ford dealers to Carolina Freight Carriers Corporation. These two claims were 
not addressed in Ford Motor's original brief in support of summary judgment, but only in its reply brief. Plaintiffs have not had an 
adequate opportunity to respond. As such, the motions for summary judgment as to these transactions are not properly before 
the court and will not be considered here. "
802,28," Ford Motor argues that the bid involving the City of Marietta, documented at Tab 24, actually involved two transactions and 
that Peach State and Capital Ford were granted equivalent levels of GPC on both. Ford Motor, however, cites no evidence to 
support this claim. In contrast, Plaintiffs point to evidence, in the form of the affidavit of William Anderson, that the GPC levels 
were different. Anderson Aff., P 78. Similarly, with respect to the transactions involving Pike County (Tab 101), Bartow Paving 
(Tab 94), Atlanta Gas Light (Tab 7), Cobb EMC (Tab 31), Georgia Department of Corrections (Tab 42), Hendrix Hauling (Tab 
49), Jackson Electric Membership (Tab 55), Seelbach & Company (Tab 71) and Walker Trucking (Tab 86) Ford Motor argues 
that Capital Ford received the same or greater levels of CPA on the subject trucks, but points to no evidence. Plaintiffs point to 
evidence that Capital Ford received a lower CPA allocation on the transaction. Anderson Aff., PP 150, 157, 62, 85, 96, 103, 109, 
125, and 140. "
803,29," In addition to the above discussed transactions, Plaintiffs have asserted an additional price discrimination claim in their 
supplemental brief in opposition to summary judgment, based on the allegation that Midway Ford (""Midway""), a Ford heavy truck 
dealer in Kansas City, was quoted a greater CPA discount than Capital Ford with respect to a proposed sale of 400 vehicles to 
ABF Systems, Inc. in 1986. Defendant contends that Plaintiffs have offered no substantiated, admissible evidence to support 
their assertion that Capital Ford was offered CPA of $ 12,625 per unit while Midway was quoted $ 13,900. A review of Plaintiff 
Anderson's third affidavit (attached to Plaintiffs' supplemental brief in opposition to Defendant's motion for summary judgment) 
and exhibit ""D"" to that affidavit, which documents the transaction, indicates that Ford Motor did grant greater CPA to Midway 
than to Capital Ford for the subject transaction. Under these circumstances, the court cannot say that no issue of material fact 
remains with regard to this transaction."
803,30," The subject transactions are documented at the following tabbed appendices to the first affidavit of William Anderson: 3, 33, 
37, 45, 48, 50, and 83. "
805,31," Plaintiff cites Arnott v. American Oil Co., 609 F.2d 873, 881 (8th Cir. 1979) for the proposition that a fiduciary duty is inherent 
in a franchise relationship. Arnott takes a distinctly minority position and numerous courts have refused to follow the case.See 
Domed Stadium, 732 F.2d at 4485. The Eighth Circuit itself, in later decisions, has declined to follow Arnott. See Bain v. 
Champlin Petroleum Co., 692 F.2d 43, 47-48 (8th Cir. 1982)."
805,32," Plaintiffs cite to Ewers v. Ford Motor Co., 843 F.2d 1331 (11th Cir. 1988) does not support the proposition that this language 
creates a fiduciary duty between Ford Motor and Capital Ford. The Ewers court referenced the preamble language in the 
Franchise Agreement to find that a question of fact existed as to whether a Ford dealer justifiably relied on the manufacturer's 
representations. Ewers did not hold that any obligations of fiduciary duty arise out of that language. In fact, the court rejected the 
dealer's contention that it had a ""confidential relationship"" with the manufacturer. Id. at 1335. "
806,33," By order dated September 12, 1990, the court dismissed Plaintiffs' other Sherman Act claims. The court declined to dismiss 
the claim relating to Ryder, finding that Plaintiffs had stated a cognizable claim under Greene v. General Foods Corp, 517 F.2d 
635 (5th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 942, 47 L. Ed. 2d 348, 96 S. Ct. 1409."
806,34," Unlike other truck manufacturers, Ford Motor did not sell directly to Ryder in the trade packages. Instead, all sales were made 
through participating Ford Motor dealers. Johnson Aff., P 3."
806,35," Available CPA was allocated by Ford Motor either as a reduction of new vehicle prices or as an allowance on used vehicle 
bids. Johnson Depo., pp. 23, 33-34. "
807,36," Ford Motor's dealers would also occasionally sell directly to Ryder outside the trade packages. In those cases, the dealers 
would negotiate independently with Ryder. Like the trade packages, these sales usually involved a used truck purchase 
requirement and CPA was available to the dealers. The evidence of record shows that the prices Ryder pays in these direct 
sales were also based on Ford Motor's fleet price lists and profits were similarly limited. Anderson Depo., p. 507."
807,37," Section 1 of the Sherman Act states: HN31[
] Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce 
among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."
807,15, U.S.C. § 1. 
809,38," In view of this ruling, it is unnecessary to reach Defendant's antitrust standing argument. "
812,1," This contract, with a nominal three year duration, was executed June 1, 1988.  It covers the terms and conditions of 
employment for all NHL hockey players and the assignment of negotiating rights of drafted amateur hockey players. Complaint 
P36; Declaration of John A. Ziegler, Jr., at P2. "
813,2," Official NHL Registry listed by Sporting News, 1992."
813,3," These rules are found at sections 9A, 9B, and 16 of the NHL By-Laws, which are incorporated as a part of the 1988 
Agreement.  See 1988 Agreement, Exs. 15, 16, and 17. "
814,4," Failure to deliver this written notice of termination and a proposed revision results in an automatic year-to-year extension of the 
contract.  1988 Agreement at Art. II § 2.01."
814,5," In their memo in opposition to defendants' motion to dismiss, plaintiffs contend that defendants' failure in this regard was one of 
several measures used to insure that a new collective bargaining agreement would not be achieved by the September 15, 1991, 
deadline, thereby exposing the Clubs to potential antitrust liability."
814,6," In its briefs, and at oral argument, the NHL made clear that James W. Quinn, an antitrust lawyer, was present on June 14, 
1991, at the time this memorandum was distributed.  Plaintiffs offer Quinn's presence as further evidence of defendants' intent to 
pursue antitrust litigation. Plaintiffs also contend that in August, 1990, the incoming Deputy Director of the NHLPA stated that ""litigation and antitrust 
certainly is an area that the NHLPA will explore in the 1991 negotiations 'to generate pressure on the owners.'"" Compl. P47. "
815,7," Under the unilateral change doctrine, if an existing collective bargaining agreement has expired, and negotiations of a new 
contract have yet to be completed, an employer must bargain to impasse before it may unilaterally change an existing term or 
condition of employment.  An employer's unilateral change, prior to bargaining impasse, results in a violation of the NLRA.  See 
Litton at 2217; Katz at 747. "
816,8," The issue of standing to sue under the Sherman Act is a question of law and is appropriate for summary resolution.  Midwest 
Communications v. Minnesota Twins, 779 F.2d 444, 449 (8th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1163, 90 L. Ed. 2d 730, 106 S. 
Ct. 2289 (1986)."
816,9," ""The focus of the doctrine of 'antitrust standing' is somewhat different from that of standing as a constitutional doctrine.  Harm 
to the antitrust plaintiff is sufficient to satisfy the constitutional standing requirement of injury in fact, but the court must make a 
further determination whether the plaintiff is a proper party to bring a private antitrust action."" Associated General Contractors, 
459 U.S. at 535 n.31; Bell v. Dow Chemical Co., 847 F.2d 1179, 1183 (5th Cir. 1988)."
816,10," ""There is . . . no allegation that any collective-bargaining agreement was terminated as a result of the coercion, no allegation 
that the aggregate share of the contracting market controlled by union firms has diminished, no allegation that the number of 
employed union members has declined, and no allegation that the Union's revenue in the form of dues or initiation fees have 
decreased."" Associated General Contractors, 459 U.S. at 542."
816,11," Plaintiffs also seem to claim that this Court may proceed to issue declaratory relief ""whether or not further relief . . . could be 
sought,"" quoting the United Food court at p. 523.  This Court rejects this position, and has the temerity to suggest that United "
817,," Food's authors may have misconstrued the words of 26 U.S.C. § 2201, which clearly relate to the timing of the action.  This 
statutory term allows a declaratory judgment plaintiff to proceed prior to exhaustion of other legal remedies, and without pleading 
an inadequate remedy at law.  See Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure § 2758 (1983); Fed.R.Civ.P. 57, Notes 
of Advisory Committee at time of Rule's adoption in 1937 (""The fact that a declaratory judgment may be granted 'whether or not 
further relief is or could be prayed' indicates that declaratory relief is alternative or cumulative and not exclusive or 
extraordinary."")."
817,12," Plaintiffs urge the Court to apply a less rigorous standard, based upon their ""reasonable apprehension"" of litigation by the 
players. For this proposition, plaintiffs cite a line of cases from this circuit and district, all of which involve declaratory judgment 
actions in potential patent infringement litigation.  See Sherwood Medical Indus., Inc. v. Deknatel, Inc., 512 F.2d 724, 728 (8th 
Cir. 1975); Medtronic, Inc. v. Mine Safety Appliances Co., 468 F. Supp. 1132, 1135 (D.Minn. 1979); Medtronic, Inc. v. American 
Optical Corp., 327 F. Supp. 1327, 1333 (D.Minn. 1971); Owatonna Mfg. Co. v. Melroe Co., 301 F. Supp. 1296, 1299 (D.Minn. 
1969). The Court rejects this suggestion.  This less rigorous standard is applied in patent cases to avoid a multiplicity of actions and the 
uncertainty and delay which broad patent litigation would entail.  Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure § 2761 
(1983).  Plaintiffs contend that this standard applies to all commercial disputes, but cite no authority in support of their 
contention.  Declaratory judgment litigation has developed distinct personalities depending upon the substantive law at issue.  
For example, in insurance litigation, declaratory judgments are frequently issued in regard to coverage issues, but are frequently 
and appropriately denied when the issue is liability.  See Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure § 2760 (1983). Accordingly, the Court finds it inappropriate to bootstrap the ""reasonable apprehension"" standard, as applied in patent cases, to 
this antitrust case. "
818,13," This has been the case historically, see, e.g., Flood v. Kuhn, 407 U.S. 258, 32 L. Ed. 2d 728, 92 S. Ct. 2099 (1972) (baseball); 
Radovich v. National Football League, 352 U.S. 445, 1 L. Ed. 2d 456, 77 S. Ct. 390 (1957) (football); United States v. 
International Boxing Club of N.Y., 348 U.S. 236, 99 L. Ed. 290, 75 S. Ct. 259 (1955) (boxing). It is even more prevalent today as the leagues and players have consented to more restrictive contract provisions.  See, e.g., 
Powell v. National Football League, 930 F.2d 1293 (8th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 112 L. Ed. 2d 700, 111 S. Ct. 711 (1991); 
United States Football League v. National Football League, 842 F.2d 1335 (2nd Cir. 1988); Wood v. National Basketball Ass'n, 
809 F.2d 954 (2nd Cir. 1987); Seattle Totems, Etc. v. National Hockey League, 652 F.2d 852 (9th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 
Northwest Sports Enterprises, Ltd. v. Seattle Totems Hockey Club, 457 U.S. 1105, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1313, 102 S. Ct. 2902 
(1982); Mackey v. National Football League, 543 F.2d 606 (8th Cir. 1976), cert. dismissed, 434 U.S. 801, 98 S. Ct. 28, 54 L. Ed. 
2d 59 (1977); Brown v. Pro Football, Inc., [1991-1 Trade Cases] CCH P69,454 (D.D.C. 1991). "
841,1," Plaintiff Jane Slowiak asserts a marital property interest as the wife of plaintiff Dennis Slowiak. As used herein ""plaintiff"" refers 
to plaintiff Dennis Slowiak. "
860,1," At the hearing on the motion to dismiss, the parties acknowledged that the State was bringing a concurrent suit to enjoin the 
alleged area price discrimination violation.  The plaintiffs advised this court in their brief that the State's action was dismissed 
because Cablevision acquired Citizens Cable.  Cablevision does not dispute this contention and concedes in its brief that the 
two businesses have indeed merged."
860,2, The action was dismissed by the trial court prior to a ruling on the issue of class certification.  See C.R.C.P. 23.
860,3," The court also noted that in order to violate the Unfair Practices Act a defendant must operate from at least two locations, and 
Cablevision operates in a single location in Colorado Springs.  That issue is not before us on certiorari review."
860,4," As previously noted, the district court in fact based its dismissal of the Unfair Practices Act claim on lack of standing. "
861,5," The complaint alleges that the overcharges have existed since the date the alleged discriminatory pricing began and will 
continue as long as the discriminatory pricing practices persist.  Statements by the plaintiffs' counsel during the hearing on the 
motion to dismiss, as well as an affidavit of an accountant submitted by the plaintiffs in opposition to the motion to dismiss, 
buttress the inference that the plaintiffs allege the overcharges were used to subsidize price cutting in the Area of Competition.  
Although the complaint asserts damages based on the difference between the low rate charged in the Area of Competition and 
the higher rate charged in the Area of Noncompetition, the plaintiffs conceded at argument that the subsidy may actually be 
lower than that amount."
861,6," See Lamm, 700 P.2d at 516 (""A decision that a plaintiff lacks standing because the claimed injury does not infringe any legally 
protected right of the plaintiff may be viewed as equivalent to a holding that the plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which 
relief may be granted.""); accord Olson, 687 P.2d at 429. "
862,7," This standard is more narrow than the standard for reviewing the issue of whether a plaintiff has standing.  In the latter 
situation, a court may consider information outside of the complaint if it is supportive of a finding that the plaintiff has standing.  
Lamm, 700 P.2d at 516. "
863,8," Although the plaintiffs alleged a violation of both the sales below cost provision of the Unfair Practices Act, § 6-2-105, and the 
provision prohibiting area price discrimination, § 6-2-103, they alleged damages resulting only from price discrimination. In 
addition, the price discrimination violation is the exclusive focus of the parties' briefs.  Therefore, we limit our analysis to whether 
the plaintiffs may assert a claim for a violation of the provision prohibiting area price discrimination. "
864,9," At least one state court would permit recovery by consumer-plaintiffs on the basis of an indirect injury.  However, this holding is 
based on the language of its statute authorizing private enforcement of antitrust violations that specifically permits ""any person "
865,," injured, directly or indirectly, by reason of anything prohibited by [the antitrust laws]"" to bring suit. Landig, 384 N.W.2d at 723 n.1 
and 723-24."
865,10," In Associated Gen. Contractors v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 103 S. Ct. 897 
(1983), the United States Supreme Court announced a series of factors to consider in determining whether a plaintiff has 
standing to sue under Section 4 of the Clayton Act. These factors are (1) a causal connection between an antitrust violation and 
the harm to the plaintiff, (2) improper intent on the part of the defendant, (3) the nature of the plaintiff's alleged injury, (4) the 
directness or indirectness of the asserted injury, (5) the potential for duplicative recovery, and (6) the existence of a more direct 
victim of the violation.  Id. at 537-45. At the time Associated General was decided, the Court had already held that ""[a] consumer 
whose money has been diminished by reason of an antitrust violation has been injured 'in his . . . property' within the meaning of 
§ 4 [of the Clayton Act]."" Reiter, 442 U.S. at 339. Given the decision in Reiter, we consider it unnecessary to analyze the 
plaintiffs' status in terms of the factors set forth in Associated General."
865,11," Our research does not reveal any cases holding to the contrary.  But cf.  Sivers Construction Co. v. United States Steel Corp., 
272 Ore. 608, 538 P.2d 932 (Or. 1975) (private damages action for violation of sales below cost prohibition not recognized, in 
circumstances where injuries complained of did not involve injuries to competitor and did ""not in any way tend to destroy 
competition"").  Enforcement provisions such as § 6-2-111 relate to a variety of antitrust provisions and therefore are construed in 
a variety of contexts.  We have not conducted exhaustive research in every conceivable area."
865,12, See footnote 8 above. 
866,13," Section 2 of the Clayton Act provided that it shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly to 
discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities, which commodities are sold for use, consumption, or resale 
within the United States or any Territory thereof or the District of Columbia or any insular possession or other place under the 
jurisdiction of the United States, where the effect of such discrimination may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to 
create a monopoly in any line of commerce [subject to certain exceptions and justifications]. . . . Clayton Act § 2, ch. 323, 38 Stat. 730 (1914). "
867,14," ""The line of competition between the seller . . . and its competitors is called the 'primary line'; that between the buyer . . . and 
his competitors, the 'secondary line.'"" Rose v. Vulcan Materials Co., 282 N.C. 643, 194 S.E.2d 521, 528 (N.C. 1973); see also 
Harris v. Capitol Records Distrib. Corp., 413 P.2d 139, 143 (Cal. 1966)."
867,15, 15 U.S.C. § 1 (1988). 
868,16," McCready v. Blue Shield, 649 F.2d 228 (4th Cir. 1981), aff'd, 457 U.S. 465, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149, 102 S. Ct. 2540 (1982)."
868,17," As noted in footnote 3, an alternate basis for the trial court's ruling in this case was its conclusion that a defendant must 
operate from more than one location before a violation of § 6-2-103 can be established.  It is unclear from the court of appeals' 
opinion whether the court considered this question, and we did not include it within the scope of our grant of certiorari review.  It 
is therefore necessary to remand for further proceedings on the issue. "
869,1," The Act also proscribes secret rebates or refunds when extended to injure competitors. § 6-2-108, 2 C.R.S. (1973)."
869,2," Standing analysis under federal law, with respect to claims brought pursuant to the federal antitrust act, the Clayton Act, is far 
more complex.  The United States Supreme Court has distinguished between constitutional standing and ""antitrust standing"".  
Southaven Land Co. v. Malone & Hyde, Inc., 715 F.2d 1079, 1084-85 (6th cir. 1983) (citing Associated Gen. Contractors of 
California, Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 103 S. Ct. 897 (1983). The Supreme 
Court found that generally harm to antitrust plaintiffs satisfies the constitutional requirement of actual injury.  Id. Federal courts 
must, however, ""make a further determination whether the plaintiff is a proper party to bring a private antitrust action."" Id. Accordingly, the Supreme Court enumerated a five-factor test for federal courts to use when analyzing standing.  Id. Among the 
factors that federal courts must consider is whether a more direct victim of the alleged antitrust violation exists.  Id. "
870,3," Section 6-2-103(1) similarly applies to ""any person, firm, or corporation doing business in the state of Colorado and engaged in 
the production, manufacture, distribution, or sale of any commodity, product, or service, or output of a service trade."" "
871,4," Under § 6-2-103(1), ""any person"" also means ""any person . . . doing business in the state of Colorado."""
871,5," At least one other court has held that private persons cannot bring suit under a similar statutory scheme.  Sivers Constr. Co. v. 
United States Steel Corp., 272 Ore. 608, 538 P.2d 932, 934 (Or. 1975)."
871,6," See supra note 2.  The federal test involves analysis of the following five factors: (1) the causal connection between the 
antitrust violation and harm to the plaintiff and whether that harm was intended to be caused; (2) the nature of the plaintiff's 
alleged injury including the status of the plaintiff as consumer or competitor in the relevant market; (3) the directness or 
indirectness of the injury, and the related inquiry of whether the damages are speculative; (4) the potential for duplicative 
recovery or complex apportionment of damages; and (5) the existence of more direct victims of the alleged antitrust violation. 
Associated Gen. Contractors v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 537-45, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 103 S. Ct. 897 
(1983)."
871,7," Federal standing analysis is directed by whether the antitrust plaintiff seeks treble damages or injunctive relief.  Actions for 
treble damages present additional concerns, such as the potential for multiple lawsuits and double recovery, the difficulty of 
apportioning damages, and the existence of other parties sustaining more direct harm as a result of the anticompetitive behavior.  
Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 111, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427, 107 S. Ct. 484 n.6 (1986). "
889,1," For purposes of analysis, the court combined plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment and defendants' motion for 
summary judgment on Count II of the amended complaint."
889,2," The NFLPA is not a party to the present lawsuit.  In its order dated May 23, 1991, the court determined in the present case that 
the NFLPA no longer represents the football players as a collective bargaining representative.  Powell v. National Football 
League, 764 F. Supp. 1351, 1358-59 (D. Minn. 1991) (holding only in McNeil)."
889,3," The NFL defendants specifically proposed to ""eliminate all . . . individual player bargaining and . . . establish a League-wide 
wage scale."" "
890,4," On February 1, 1989, the NFL defendants implemented Plan B without the approval of either the players or the NFLPA."
890,5," The member clubs have all entered into contracts with players for the 1993 season. According to defendants' records, at least 
370 players have signed contracts for the 1993 season, 69 players have signed for the 1994 season, 22 players have signed 
contracts for the 1995 season and 2 players have signed contracts for the 1996 season. "
892,6," Based on its determination that neither side is entitled to summary judgment on Count II, the court does not address 
defendants' contentions that plaintiffs' claims in Count II should be judged under the rule of reason, that plaintiffs fail to carry 
their burden under that rule or that defendants' proffered justification, the promotion of competitive balance among member 
teams, creates a genuine issue of material fact."
892,7," Commissioner Tagliabue also makes various other assertions concerning the structure and operation of the league in his 
attempt to demonstrate that the NFL member clubs constitute a joint venture."
892,8," The court notes that defendants' position has also been implicitly rejected in all of the other cases that have found that various 
NFL player restraints violate section 1 of the Sherman Act, including the Eighth Circuit's decision in Mackey v. National Football 
League, 543 F.2d 606 (8th Cir. 1976), cert. dismissed, 434 U.S. 801, 98 S. Ct. 28, 54 L. Ed. 2d 59 (1977), the District of 
Columbia Circuit's decision in Smith v. Pro Football, Inc., 193 App. D.C. 19, 593 F.2d 1173 (D.C. Cir. 1978), and the district 
court's decision in Kapp v. National Football League, 390 F. Supp. 73 (N.D. Cal. 1974), aff'd in part, dismissed in part as moot, 
586 F.2d 644 (9th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 907, 99 S. Ct. 1996, 60 L. Ed. 2d 375 (1979). In Mackey, the Eighth Circuit expressly held that NFL player restraints similar to those challenged in the present case were 
unlawful under section 1 of the Sherman Act. Id. at 620-23.  Although the Eighth Circuit noted that the NFL member clubs were 
not business competitors in the traditional sense, and therefore rejected application of the per se rule, id. at 619, the court 
nevertheless found that the challenged restraint violated section 1 under the rule of reason, thus implicitly determining that the 
NFL member clubs were capable of conspiring for purposes of the Sherman Act. Id. at 620-22."
892,9," The court also observes that not all of the NFL defendants seem to agree with his characterization.  For example, Val Davis, 
principal owner of the defendant Los Angeles Raiders, recently testified in this case that the NFL member clubs are ""vicious 
competitors,"" a statement consistent with the position that he took in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission case."
892,10, The facts on which those cases relied include: 
893,1," .  The NFL is organized as an unincorporated association of 28 separately owned professional football teams, each 
operated through a distinct corporation or partnership.  See Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Comm'n, 726 F.2d at 1389-90; 
North American Soccer League, 670 F.2d at 1252;"
893,2," .  No NFL member club shares its expenses, capital expenditures, profits or losses with any other member.  See Los 
Angeles Memorial Coliseum Comm'n, 726 F.2d at 1390; North American Soccer League, 670 F.2d at 1252;"
893,3," .  Each club is managed independently, ""making its own decisions concerning ticket prices, player acquisitions and

further noted that clubs from other areas are at least potential competitors because they have the capacity to move into 
each other's territories.  Id."
893,11," Like the Ninth Circuit, the Second Circuit focused on the characteristics that demonstrate the economically independent nature 
of the clubs, emphasizing that: in spite of sharing of some revenues, the financial performance of each team, while related to that of the others, does not, 
because of the variables in revenues and costs as between member teams, necessarily rise or fall with that of the others."
893,670, F.2d at 1252. 
894,12," Moreover, as plaintiffs note in their brief in support of their motion for partial summary judgment concerning defendants' 
monopoly power in relevant markets, it is probable that defendants are collaterally estopped from arguing in the Eighth Circuit 
that a labor market is outside the reach of the antitrust laws based on the Eighth Circuit's prior holdings in Powell, 930 F.2d at 
1297-99 & n.4 and Mackey, 543 F.2d at 616-18. Mackey and Powell involved player restraints that are the predecessors of the 
restraints at issue in the present case. "
895,13," Although defendants maintain that the Plan B right of first refusal/compensation system is valid under the Sherman Act, they 
argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs' damage claims for the 1990 and 1991 seasons regardless of 
whether that system is ultimately deemed lawful. "
896,14," In Powell, this court distinguished between the NFL's conduct before and after November 6, 1989, when ruling on plaintiffs' 
class decertification motion; that distinction was based on the parties' agreement, for purposes of that motion only, that the labor 
exemption ended as of November 6, 1989.  Powell v. National Football League, 139 F.R.D. 381, 383 (D. Minn. 1991). In the 
present case, the court notes that the labor exemption ended some time in November or December of 1989, and no later than 
December 5, 1989, the date on which the NFLPA player representatives, in response to the players' petitions, voted to end the 
NFLPA's status as the players' collective bargaining representative.  McNeil I, 764 F. Supp. at 1356. Thus, for purposes of the 
present case, the court has not yet determined the exact date on which the nonstatutory labor exemption ended, although it 
notes that the expiration occurred sometime between November 6, 1989, and December 5, 1989.  See id.; Powell, 139 F.R.D. at 
383 (stating that as a result of the parties' agreement, the court assumed that the labor exemption ended as of November 6, 
1989, for purposes of the decertification motions in Powell only). "
897,15," The court notes that if it were to adopt defendants' position, plaintiffs' damage claims would be dependent on the vicissitudes 
of the federal court system, the nature of a particular judge's docket, the tactical delays of adversaries and any other delays 
inherent in the discovery process."
897,16," Cf.  Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 115 L. Ed. 2d 321, 111 S. Ct. 2773 (1991)(five justices determining 
to retroactively apply newly announced federal statute of limitations for Rule 10b-5 security fraud claims without mentioning the 
Chevron analysis); James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 115 L. Ed. 2d 481, 111 S. Ct. 2439, 2451 (1991)(O'Connor, J., 
dissenting)(noting that majority and concurring opinions in Beam retroactively apply new rule to all parties without addressing the "
898,," Chevron analysis).  Although the continued viability of the Chevron analysis may be in doubt after the Court's decisions in Lampf 
and Beam, this court nevertheless analyzed McNeil I under Chevron."
898,17," The court further concludes that if defendants had any legitimate uncertainty about whether the nonstatutory labor exemption 
would end at some point, that uncertainty should have been dispelled as of November 1, 1989, the date on which the Eighth 
Circuit rejected their infinite immunity defense.  930 F.2d at 1303-04. The court thus concludes that the NFL defendants knew, or 
should have known, at least as of November 1, 1989, that the exemption would end if the collective bargaining relationship 
ended. "
899,18," In McNeil I, this court further observed that shortly after the Eighth Circuit's decision in Powell III: (i) the NFLPA's Executive Committee voted to renounce collective bargaining; (ii) the Committee then advised the NFL defendants that it would no longer represent players in the grievance process or 
engage in collective bargaining; (iii) the NFLPA's player representatives adopted new bylaws ending the organization's status as players' collective 
bargaining representative; and (iv) the NFLPA filed a labor termination notice with the United States Department of Labor."
899,764, F. Supp. at 1356. 
900,19," The court thus rejects defendants' contention that ""there was not a single case . . . that would have foreshadowed [an] opinion 
that the NFLPA's unilateral abandonment of collective bargaining rights would be sufficient to nullify the NFL's nonstatutory labor 
exemptions."" Defendant's Brief at 12 n.5.  First, the dissent in Powell III clearly suggested such a result.  The court further notes 
that plaintiffs cited a number of such cases in their motion for partial summary judgment on the labor exemption issue in McNeil. 
(Plaintiffs' Brief in Support of their Motion for Partial Summary Judgment at 11-15 (Nov. 2, 1990)). In evaluating the effectiveness of the NFLPA's disclaimer of its status as a labor union, the NLRB also cited various cases in 
support of that proposition when ruling that: In order for a union's disclaimer in representing a particular unit to be valid, it must be unequivocal, made in good faith, and 
unaccompanied by inconsistent conduct.  We conclude that there has been no conduct by the NFLPA which is inconsistent 
with its disclaimer.  Moreover, when a union has made a valid disclaimer, no question concerning representation exists and 
a decertification election will not be held because it would be an unnecessary waste of time and resources.  In addition, the 
fact that the disclaimer was motivated by ""litigation strategy,"" i.e., to deprive the NFL of a defense to players' antitrust suits 
and to free the players to engage in individual bargaining for free agency, is irrelevant so long as the disclaimer is otherwise 
unequivocal and adhered to."
900,1991," WL 144468 at *4 n.8 (June 26, 1991)(emphasis added)."
900,20," The ruling concluded that the NFLPA's: disclaimer is valid.  Furthermore, the NFLPA has not merely disclaimed representative status; it has restructured itself so 
that it no longer functions as a collective-bargaining agent.  Accordingly, the NFLPA is not a labor organization as defined in 
Section 2(5) of the Act. Id. at *2 (footnote omitted). "
901,21," The court further concludes that the reliance cases cited by defendants fail to support their position.  In Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. 
United Shoe Machinery Corp., the Third Circuit held that defendants were not liable for conduct occurring before a change in the 
law because the Supreme Court, on three prior occasions, had upheld such conduct under the Sherman Act. 377 F.2d 776, 788-
89 (3d Cir. 1967). The Supreme Court, however, expressly rejected that ruling because the change in antitrust law on which the 
Third Circuit relied did not involve a novel issue or require innovative principles to reach it, but rather was resolved on the basis 
of existing authorities.  392 U.S. 481, 495-97 & n.12 (1968). The other cases on which the NFL defendants rely merely emphasize the difference between genuine reliance interests and 
defendants' feigned unawareness.  In American Trucking Association v. Smith, 496 U.S. 167, 110 S. Ct. 2323, 110 L. Ed. 2d 148 
(1990), the Supreme Court refused to retroactively invalidate state tax legislation that, when enacted, had been lawful under 
Supreme Court precedent.  Id. at 2331-33. Although recognizing the need for prospective application of new constitutional 
decisions, the Court noted that states and municipalities, like private individuals and entities, are responsible for anticipating 
developments in the law.  Id. at 2334. The court further rejects defendants' reliance on Lyons v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 235 F. Supp. 526 (S.D.N.Y. 1964). In 
declining to retroactively apply new Supreme Court doctrine to impose treble damages on Westinghouse in connection with its 
agency system, a system that prior decisions had upheld for more than thirty years, the Lyons court observed that: Here we have an agency system which was expressly upheld by the Supreme Court in General Electric and later by Judge 
Forman as well.  There can be no doubt whatever that Westinghouse relied on these decisions in continuing that system in 
effect. Id. at 537. "
902,," Unlike Westinghouse, the court finds that the NFL defendants have no decisions on which to reasonably rely to justify their 
unilateral imposition of Plan B once the players withdrew their support of the NFLPA and the NFLPA renounced its status as the 
players' collective bargaining representative.  The Eighth Circuit's decision in Powell III clearly indicated that the labor exemption 
would terminate in the absence of a collective bargaining relationship.  The court notes that other cases have held that a union is 
not required to formally decertify in order to terminate its status as a collective bargaining representative.  The court further notes 
that other courts have determined that similar NFL player restraints violate antitrust law.  Based on the foregoing, the court 
determines that defendants possess no reasonable reliance interest because they have nothing on which to reasonably rely."
902,22," The nonstatutory labor exemption is not an affirmative element of plaintiffs' case but rather a defense asserted by defendants.  
The court thus notes that it is not plaintiffs' burden to initiate procedures to determine the efficacy of that defense."
902,23," The court further rejects defendants' claim that they were unaware of ""the bases of plaintiffs' claim that an ongoing collective 
bargaining relationship no longer existed between the NFLPA and the NFL"" until plaintiffs filed their motion for summary 
judgment on that issue in August 1990.  Defendants' Brief at 19 n.7.  Defendants directly contradict that claim by admitting, in 
that same brief, that they were aware that players and the NFLPA took steps to end the labor exemption in November and 
December 1989.  Id. at 18. "
904,24," The trial court in Mackey also determined that the Rozelle Rule constituted a per se antitrust violation.  As a result, the NFL 
defendants attempt to argue that neither determination should be entitled to preclusive effect because the Mackey court found 
alternate grounds for its decision.  The court, however, rejects defendants' characterization of those two holdings as ""alternate 
grounds"" because the Rozelle Rule could constitute both a rule of reason and per se violation under the antitrust laws. The 
decision that the Rozelle Rule violated the rule of reason provides an independent ground for the Mackey decision, and that 
determination clearly required a definition of a relevant market. The court further notes that the Eighth Circuit expressly affirmed 
the trial court's rule of reason decision.  It is clear that when an appeals court specifically affirms one basis for a holding and 
rejects another, as the Eighth Circuit did in Mackey, that holding which was affirmed is entitled to preclusive effect. See 
Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 27, cmt. o, at 263 (""if the appellate court upholds one of these determinations as 
sufficient but not the other, and accordingly affirms the judgment, the judgment is conclusive as to the first determination""); see 
also Gelb v. Royal Globe Ins. Co., 798 F.2d 38, 45 (2d Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 948, 94 L. Ed. 2d 794, 107 S. Ct. 1608 
(1987)(same). The court similarly rejects defendants' contention that the Smith decision is not entitled to preclusive effect because the Court of 
Appeals reversed the district's court analysis under the per se rule while upholding its decision under the rule of reason. See 
infra (discussing Smith). "
905,25," The court also notes that other cases involving similar challenges to player restraints in professional sports leagues have 
similarly found that the relevant market is the market for player services in the respective sport. See, e.g., McCourt v. California 
Sports, Inc., 460 F. Supp. 904, 906-07 (E.D. Mich. 1978)(defining the relevant market as that for National Hockey League player 
services and citing Mackey for that proposition), vacated on other grounds, 600 F.2d 1193 (6th Cir. 1979); Robertson v. National 
Basketball Ass'n, 67 F.R.D. 691, 694 & n.3 (S.D.N.Y. 1975)(the relevant market was the competition for professional basketball 
player services)."
905,26," Although defendants Tampa Bay Area NFL Football Club, Inc. and the Seattle Professional Football Club, Ltd. were not in 
existence and thus not named as defendants in the prior actions, the court concludes that those defendants are nonetheless 
bound by the prior determinations because the interests of those defendants are identical to the interests of the other NFL 
member clubs, with whom they are in privity, and their interests were adequately represented in the prior actions.  See Expert 
Elec., Inc. v. Levine, 554 F.2d 1227, 1233 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 903, 98 S. Ct. 300, 54 L. Ed. 2d 190 (1977); 
Aluminum Co. v. Admiral Merchants Motor Freight, Inc., 486 F.2d 717, 721 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1113, 94 S. Ct. 843, 
38 L. Ed. 2d 739 (1973). "
906,27," Although the Los Angeles Raiders, Ltd. were not named as a defendant in the USFL case, the court finds that there was a 
sufficient identity of interest to bind the Raiders as being in privity with the NFL and the other member clubs. See supra n.26. The court further notes that the NFL defendants had a full and fair opportunity to be heard on those issues because the trial took 
forty-eight days and produced a transcript of over 7,000 pages.  USFL, 842 F.2d at 1341."
906,28," The court further notes that other courts have found, in similar antitrust actions against the NFL defendants, that professional 
football constitutes a relevant market. See, e.g., Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Comm'n, 726 F.2d at 1393 (""NFL itself 
narrowly defined the relevant market by emphasizing that NFL football is a unique product""); Hecht v. Pro-Football, Inc., 187 
App. D.C. 73, 570 F.2d 982, 988 (D.C. Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 956, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1121, 98 S. Ct. 3069 (1978) (relevant 
product market was ""indisputably the business of professional football""); Mid-South Grizzlies v. National Football League, 550 F. 
Supp. 558, 571 & n.3 (E.D. Pa. 1982)(relevant market was major league professional football), aff'd, 720 F.2d 772 (3d Cir. 
1983), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1215, 104 S. Ct. 2657, 81 L. Ed. 2d 364 (1984)."
906,29, The jury awarded the USFL only one dollar in damages.  See 842 F.2d at 1340.
906,30," The court further notes that the other cases on which defendants rely are distinguishable because they all involved situations 
in which defendants lacked sufficient incentive to vigorously litigate issues at the initial proceeding, either at trial or on a motion 
for summary judgment, rather than on appeal.  In the USFL case, the court concludes that the NFL defendants had every 
incentive to vigorously litigate those issues at the trial level because the USFL plaintiffs sought treble damages in excess of 1.7 
billion dollars.  842 F.2d at 1341. "
907,31," In American Football League, the Fourth Circuit found that there were three areas in which the rival leagues competed on a 
national basis: for television coverage, for spectators and for outstanding players and coaches.  323 F.2d at 130. The Fourth 
Circuit's determination that there was nationwide competition for the services of professional football players thus foreshadowed 
and is entirely consistent with the relevant market holdings in Kapp, Mackey and Smith.  The Second Circuit also noted in the 
USFL case that ""in 1966, the NFL and the AFL agreed to merge, largely because the competition for players had sharply 
increased salaries.  Congress exempted this merger from the antitrust laws by legislation. . . ."" 842 F.2d at 1344."
907,32," Plaintiffs also argue that the 1970 merger of the AFL and NFL was in large part responsible for the NFL defendants' ability to 
achieve monopoly power in the national market for major league professional football."
907,33," The district court held that: Any inference of a compromise verdict in this case is easily rebutted by ""an equally reasonable and perhaps even better 
explanation"" namely that the jurors consciously and unanimously based their award on the Court's charge on nominal 
damages.  Indeed, the USFL concedes the validity of such an explanation, while arguing that the charge the jury may have 
followed was ""entirely erroneous."" Given plaintiffs' concession, as well as this Court's independent finding that ""the record 
itself viewed in its entirety [does not] clearly demonstrate the compromised character of the verdict,"" a new trial is not 
justified on the grounds of improper compromise. "
908,," USFL, 644 F. Supp. at 1050 (citations omitted). In upholding that ruling, the Second Circuit stated: We also reject the USFL's claim that the award of nominal damages in an antitrust case is somehow 'suspect.' Other courts 
routinely approve the award of such damages. . . . USFL, 842 F.2d at 1377 (citations omitted)."
908,34," The court further notes that the finding of monopoly power in the USFL case was made despite the fact that a rival football 
league existed at that time.  At the present time, there is no rival league and the NFL defendants occupy 100 percent of the 
relevant market. The court thus determines that the jury's determination that defendants' possessed monopoly power was based 
on a situation less compelling than that presented by the instant case. "
909,35," Based on the courts' determination that the challenged restraints should be judged under the rule of reason, the court did not 
address the NFL defendants' argument that the per se rule should not be applied because those restraints are ancillary to their 
""joint venture"". "
954,1," By stipulation of the parties, Berwick Oil Co. subsequently replaced Delta Oil Co. in this lawsuit. R8-165."
954,2," By stipulation of the parties, Mapco, Inc. was dismissed from this lawsuit. Id. "
955,3," Plaintiffs subsequently amended their complaint to include allegations of below-cost pricing undertaken by Mapco after the 
initial filing of plaintiffs' action. All told, plaintiffs alleged that between May 1, 1984 and December 31, 1988, Mapco had sold 
gasoline below cost for 596 days at its Old Shell Road retail location and for 821 days at its St. Stephens Road retail location. 
Plaintiffs now estimate their losses incurred as a result of Mapco's pricing activities at $ 250,000. Plaintiffs seek treble damages 
under the AMFMA. Ala.Code § 8-22-17(b). "
956,4," Mapco's federal antitrust claims actually came under § 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15, which makes available treble 
damages to ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws."" 
Plaintiffs' alleged violations of the Sherman Act and the Robinson-Patman Act furnish the factual and legal predicates for 
Mapco's Clayton Act claim."
956,5," The district court rejected Mapco's preemption argument, and Mapco has not raised it on appeal. "
957,6," Mapco does not appeal the district court's grant of summary judgment on its Robinson-Patman Act counterclaim. Thus, the 
only federal antitrust issue before us relates to Mapco's claim under the Sherman Act. "
958,7," Accordingly, we do not reach the issue on the basis of which the district court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs on 
Mapco's Sherman Act counterclaim -- i.e., whether Mapco established its antitrust injury sufficient to give it standing under the 
Sherman Act."
958,8," The Eleventh Circuit has adopted as binding precedent decisions of Unit B of the former Fifth Circuit.  Stein v. Reynolds 
Securities, Inc., 667 F.2d 33 (11th Cir.1982)."
958,9," Under the Sherman Act, Noerr-Pennington immunity is not merely an affirmative defense. Rather, ""the antitrust plaintiff has the 
burden of establishing that the defendant restrained trade unreasonably, which cannot be done when the restraining action is 
that of the government."" P. Areeda and H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, § 203.4c (1990 supp.). Thus, the burden falls on Mapco 
in this case to allege facts sufficient to show that Noerr-Pennington immunity did not attach to plaintiffs' actions. "
959,10," The Eleventh Circuit, in the en banc decision Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981), adopted as 
precedent decisions of the former Fifth Circuit rendered prior to October 1, 1981. "
960,11," Mapco claims it already has been injured by plaintiffs' litigation activities because of the stipulation entered into by the parties 
in 1988, pursuant to which Mapco raised its prices to at-cost levels and suffered considerable losses in revenues. Mapco 
contends that these losses derive not from the outcome of the litigation but from the coercion and duplicity of plaintiffs, and 
reflect the degree to which plaintiffs sought to inflict injury on Mapco through the litigative process itself, rather than through the 
outcome they sought from that process. Mapco's position is unavailing. Mapco cannot allege that plaintiffs did anything but ""use 
the adjudicatory process to obtain a favorable outcome."" St. Joseph's Hosp. v. Hospital Corp. of America, 795 F.2d at 955. Such 
use is protected under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, given that the plaintiffs ""were within their rights to use every available 
legal means"" to succeed in the litigation. Id. Further, Mapco cannot treat as abuse of the judicial process the entry of a 
stipulation to which the parties voluntarily agreed, regardless of the injurious effect it had on Mapco's business."
960,12," We note that the Supreme Court recently has granted certiorari in a case involving application of the ""sham"" exception to 
Noerr-Pennington immunity. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. v. Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc., 944 F.2d 1525 (9th 
Cir.1991), cert. granted    U.S.   ,    S. Ct.   ,    L. Ed. 2d   , 1992 WL 58998, 1992 LEXIS 2110 (March 30, 1992). In that case, the 
Ninth Circuit rejected the defendant-counterclaimant's contentions that a lawsuit could fall under the ""sham"" exception if the 
plaintiff ""did not honestly believe that [its] claim was meritorious,"" 944 F.2d at 1530, and that the question of a plaintiff's 
subjective intent in bringing suit was a question of fact precluding summary judgment. The Ninth Circuit, declining to adopt the 
approach taken by the Fifth Circuit in In re Burlington Northern, 822 F.2d 518, 529 (5th Cir.1987), held that a suit brought with 
probable cause did not fall within the ""sham"" exception, and that: an antitrust plaintiff must make a two-part showing to support a finding of sham: (1) that the suit is baseless -- a legal question 
[citations omitted]; and (2) that the suit was brought as part of an anticompetitive plan external to the underlying litigation -- a 
question of fact. Columbia Pictures, 944 F.2d at 1532. In this case, Mapco has presented no facts to suggest that the plaintiffs' lawsuit was 
brought as part of an anticompetitive plan external to the underlying litigation, and therefore has failed to satisfy the second 
prong of the Ninth Circuit's test. See supra at 2247-2248, 2249; infra at 2252. Mapco has also failed to satisfy the first prong of 
that test, insofar as the plaintiffs' AMFMA claims, even if ultimately unsuccessful, do not lack a reasonable basis in fact or law. 
See Opdyke Inv. Co. v. City of Detroit, 883 F.2d 1265, 1273 (6th Cir.1989) (unsuccessful lawsuit not a sham where the trial court 
did not treat the theory as frivolous and the antitrust plaintiffs did not contend that the theory of the underlying case was so 
farfetched as to warrant the imposition of sanctions against the attorneys who brought it). Even under the subjective standard rejected by the Ninth Circuit, Mapco cannot prove that the plaintiffs' activity in this case falls 
within the ""sham"" exception. Although Mapco alleged in its counterclaim that ""[plaintiffs] have instituted litigation against [Mapco] 
not to secure appropriate judicial relief but, rather, to force [Mapco] to increase the price at which it sells gasoline . . ."", R3-68-
P14, Mapco has failed to sustain its burden on summary judgment of presenting evidence that supports these allegations of bad 
faith. There is simply no evidence in the record to suggest that the plaintiffs did not honestly believe that their claims under the "
961,," AMFMA were meritorious. Thus, regardless of the disposition of Columbia Pictures in the Supreme Court, the ""sham"" exception 
to Noerr-Pennington immunity does not apply in this case."
961,13," We are, of course, not bound by Premier, and express no opinion as to whether we should in fact adhere to the reasoning of 
the Seventh Circuit on the issue of litigative costs as a source of antitrust injury. "
962,14," We reach the constitutional issue only because we do not agree with the district court that the AUTPA is only penal in nature 
and does not provide for a private cause of action. The Alabama Supreme Court's decision in Valley Heating, Cooling Electric 
Co., Inc. v. Alabama Gas Corporation, 286 Ala. 79, 237 So. 2d 470 (1970), recognizes the availability of a private cause of 
action under AUTPA."
962,15," The requirement that a plaintiff must have been injured as a result of a defendant's violations of the AMFMA functions as a 
kind of antitrust injury requirement, Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, 429 U.S. 477, 489, 97 S. Ct. 690, 697, 50 L. Ed. 2d 
701 (1977), and ""ensures that the harm claimed by the plaintiff corresponds to the rationale for finding a violation of the antitrust 
laws in the first place."" ARCO, 495 U.S. at 354, 110 S. Ct. at 1900. Indeed, Ala.Code § 8-22-17 is very similar to Clayton Act 
section 4, which establishes the federal antitrust injury requirement. Other courts have construed state antitrust laws to contain 
antitrust injury requirements similar to that of the Clayton Act. E.g., Ghem v. Mapco Petroleum, 767 F. Supp. 1418, 1423 
(M.D.Tenn.1990) (finding antitrust injury requirement in Tennessee Petroleum Trade Practices Act). "
968,1," I note as a preliminary matter that while there is diversity of the parties, the court may only infer from the pleadings filed in this 
case that the amount in controversy is over $ 50,000."
968,2," The plaintiff alleges in the same paragraph of its complaint both that the mandatory prices were too high because consumers 
could pay less for the same Oreck product through American Express, and that the mandatory prices were too low, because 
they reduced Remco's margins to an unprofitable level. "
971,3," The non-price restraints which Remco challenges as legally impermissible include Oreck's controls over cooperative 
advertising and various sales promotions. HN6[
] Within the context of distributorship terminations, courts have afforded 
manufacturers great latitude to establish certain kinds of non-price restraints, based upon the reasoning that such restraints may 
have effects that actually enhance competition. See, e.g., Bruce Drug, Inc. v. Hollister Inc., 688 F.2d 853, 860 (1st Cir. 1982); 
Winter Hill, 691 F. Supp. at 545-46 and cases cited therein. Nor do the suggestions in Remco's briefing - but not reflected in its 
complaint - of complaints by other dealers regarding Remco pricing below minimums assertedly mandated by Oreck establish

] However, under certain circumstances, unilateral refusals to deal may be violative of Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. This section proscribes monopolization and attempts to monopolize and, thus, may embrace a unilateral refusal to 
deal when it is accompanied by an intent to monopolize and the requisite degree of market power.  No concerted action is 
necessary.  Instead, monopolistic or other anticompetitive intent is the key factor in determining whether a statutory violation has 
occurred under this section.  Thus, when a refusal to deal is involved, an action may be stated only where the refusal is "
983,," designed to have anticompetitive effect, such as where the monopolist's intent is to gain greater market share, to drive up prices, 
or to obtain some other illegal goal.  Mr. Furniture Warehouse, Inc. v. Barclays American/Commercial Inc., 919 F.2d 1517 (11th 
Cir. 1990) (furniture buyer lacked standing to challenge commercial factor's refusal, as alleged monopolist, to deal with it absent 
allegation that factor's refusal to extend credit was attempt to garner more market share or to accomplish any other 
anticompetitive end); Nat'l Indep. Theatre Exhibitors, Inc. v. Charter Financial Group, Inc., 747 F.2d 1396 (11th Cir. 1984) (film 
distributor's refusal to grant film distribution rights to plaintiff association could not be viewed as a predatory refusal to deal, as 
proscribed by the Sherman Act, because defendant plainly lacked sufficient market power to present a dangerous probability of 
success).  Because plaintiff here neither alleged this legal claim in its complaint, nor the facts necessary to support all of the 
elements of such action, the Court will not consider whether plaintiff can state a claim for relief under Section 2 of the Sherman 
Antitrust Act. "
986,2," The antitrust violation, that plaintiff was injured by defendant's discriminatory pricing policies, is similarly alleged inadequately.  
In order to state a price discrimination cause of action, plaintiff must allege that there were two sales made by the same seller, 
i.e. defendant, to at least two different purchasers at different prices.  DeLong, 887 F.2d at 1516. Although plaintiff makes a "
987,," general allegation that such was done, it failed to identify another distributor that received a better price and he did not aver what 
that price was. "

993,3," Many additional factors will affect depositors' ultimate recovery. For example, liquidators are presently pursuing additional 
claims on behalf of BCCI, including claims filed against both E&Y and various Price Waterhouse entities."
993,4," Plaintiffs have not argued otherwise. They contend, however, that United States depositors presently suffer the loss of the use

993,5," Additionally, United States citizens Philip Merz and Amit Pandya seek to be added to this action as plaintiffs."

officers or agents; (4) United States assistors or co-conspirators; (5) other United States instrumentalities; and (6) professional 
service providers to BCCI (i.e., accountants, lawyers, and public relations firm). See Complaint, chart following page 47. "

law of nations. See Filartiga v. Pena-Irala, 630 F.2d 876, 887-88 (2d Cir. 1980)."
994,11," Part of the Order was adapted from a RICO Standing Order or Case Statement issued by Judge Krenzler in Lyman Steel Co. 
v. Shearson Lehman Bros., Inc., 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29346, No. C 86-355 (N.D. Ohio Feb. 13, 1986). A similar RICO Case 
Statement must now accompany all RICO filings in the Southern District of California. See General Order No. 386, 92 Daily 
Journal DAR 883 (Jan. 22, 1992)."
994,12," BCCI's financing of ""fronts"" or strawmen - wealthy businessmen and rulers of middle eastern states - permitted BCCI to 
surreptitiously acquire and control defendant First American Bank (400 branches in six states, based in Washington, D.C.); the 
National Bank of Georgia (the largest bank in Georgia); CenTrust Savings (20 branches in Florida); Independence Bank (11 
branches, based in Encino, California; now insolvent and voluntarily dismissed by plaintiffs as a defendant in this case), and 
Viking Savings & Loan (Santa Monica, California)."
994,13," The Court ordered plaintiffs, by appending paragraphs 342, 350 and 358 of the Complaint, to ""describe the causal relationship 
between plaintiffs' alleged injury and each defendants' violation of [RICO]."" See Order, PP 10(L), (M), and (N) (emphasis in 
original)."
994,14," The alleged assistance provided by the defendants includes the defendants' failure to publicly disclose BCCI's true nature and 
their assistance helping BCCI avoid detection by regulators. "
995,15," However, the Court does not ""necessarily assume the truth of legal conclusions merely because they are cast in the form of 
factual allegations."" Western Mining Council v. Watt, 643 F.2d 618, 624 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1031, 102 S. Ct. 567, 
70 L. Ed. 2d 474 (1981)."
995,16," Rule 9(b) serves three purposes: (1) providing a defendant fair notice of the plaintiff's claim, thus enabling the defendant to 
prepare a defense; (2) protecting a defendant from harm to his reputation or goodwill; and (3) reducing the number of strike 
suits.  Di Vittorio v. Equidyne Extractive Indus., Inc., 822 F.2d 1242, 1247 (2d Cir. 1987) (citing Reingold v. Deloitte Haskins & 
Sells, 599 F. Supp. 1241, 1266 (S.D.N.Y. 1984) (Rule 9(b) ""inhibits the filing of a complaint as a pretext for discovery of unknown 
wrongs."")."
995,17," For example, the public relations firm H&K complains that it is only alleged to have distributed a ""fact sheet"" in response to a 
magazine article about BCCI. See Complaint, PP 36, 334. Defendant Dobrich notes that he is only alleged to have been hired as 
an executive of Independence Bank in mid-1989, although plaintiffs' conspiracy allegations span sixteen years. See Complaint, 
Ex. 23. E&Y objects to its inclusion in charged misconduct that occurred over unspecified or broad spans of time, particularly 
since E&Y resigned as BCCI's auditor in 1987 and none of the alleged losses occurred until 1991. "
996,18," Though the defendant accounting firms contend that plaintiffs have merely substituted ""PW/UK, PW/US and PW/Luxembourg"" 
for each previous instance of ""Price Waterhouse"" and ""EY/US, EY/UK, and EY/Luxembourg"" for each previous instance of 
""Ernst & Young,"" not all allegations contain all three entities. Plaintiffs have made some distinctions between the entities in the 
Complaint."
996,19," The Court's dismissal of substantive RICO claims constitutes a dismissal of the conspiracy alleged under section 1962(d) as 
well. See Condict v. Condict, 826 F.2d 923, 927 (10th Cir. 1987) (""any claim under section 1962(d) based on a conspiracy to 
violate the provisions of 18 U.S.C. section 1962(a), (b), or (c) must necessarily fail if the substantive claims are themselves 
deficient"")."
996,20," The Court's Order required plaintiffs to amend paragraph 341 of the pleading and ""(i) state specifically who received income 
derived from the pattern of racketeering activity; (ii) describe the use or investment of such income and the enterprise in which it "
997,," was used or invested; and (iii) state specifically how the victims were injured by reason of the use or investment of racketeering 
income."" Order, P 10(H)."
997,21," The Ninth Circuit declined to reach this issue in Reddy v. Litton Indus., Inc., 912 F.2d 291 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 502 
U.S. 921, 112 S. Ct. 332, 116 L. Ed. 2d 272 (1991), but recognized that three of four circuit courts and a majority of district 
courts have required section 1962(a) plaintiffs to show injury from the use or investment of racketeering income rather than from 
the predicate acts alone.  912 F.2d at 295-96. The court also noted that Judge Tashima acknowledged the split of opinion on the 
issue and that his opinion in NMEC, 682 F. Supp. 1073, was issued without the benefit of the appellate decisions in the Second,  
Third, and Tenth Circuits. Reddy, 912 F.2d at 296 n.6."
997,22," In response to defendants' objections that they had not invested in BCCI, the Court previously observed that the complaint 
sufficiently alleged the use or investment of income in an enterprise under § 1962(a), ""at least to the extent the enterprise is 
defined as the associated-in-fact enterprise consisting of the BCCI Banks and the defendants listed in the complaint."" Order, P 3. 
The Court did not thereby determine that this claim was legally sufficient in all respects; the present challenge to the legal 
sufficiency of the claim was not before the Court. "
998,23," This issue is a question of law for the Court. See In re Sunrise Sec. Litig., 916 F.2d 874, 882 (3d Cir. 1990) (""Whether a claim 
is individual or derivative is determined from the body of the complaint rather than from the label employed by the parties."")."
998,24," Although a depositor is a creditor of a bank or savings and loan, ""courts have relied on the principles applicable in shareholder 
suits in deciding whether depositors and other creditors have stated a claim that may be brought individually."" In re Sunrise Sec. 
Litig., 916 F.2d at 880 (citations omitted)."
998,25," The Court rejects plaintiffs' argument that RICO's lack of separate standing requirements permits recovery for indirect injury 
that would otherwise be characterized as derivative. Such a result would impermissibly expand federal jurisdiction over suits that 
are barred under other substantive legal principles. See Warren v. Manufacturers Nat'l Bank, 759 F.2d 542, 545 (6th Cir. 1985)."
998,26," Indeed, the Seventh Circuit contrasted Ashland Oil with the result reached by the district court in Dana Molded Prods., Inc. v. 
Brodner, 58 B.R. 576 (N.D. Ill. 1986), which barred a RICO claim as derivative because ""the predicate acts of racketeering on 
which plaintiff bases its claim all involve fraudulent transfers of money [from the bankrupt corporation] and the injuries plaintiff 
asserts are indistinguishable from those suffered by [the bankrupt corporation] itself."" Id. at 579. Dana Molded Products, rather 
than Ashland Oil, is more akin to the facts facing the Court here."
998,27," The Court invited plaintiffs to plead the one condition that would permit them to avoid this result: a special duty to the 
depositors that would give them direct claims. The only other condition that would permit a direct suit - special injury not suffered 
by all depositors - cannot apply in these circumstances where the plaintiffs are, by definition, the putative class of all depositors. 
See Order, P 2 at 2-3 & n.1. Plaintiffs allege a ""special duty"" exists because all the defendants were aware of the criminal conduct of BCCI and the risk to 
depositors' funds, and since public disclosure of this information would have prevented depositors from placing their funds in 
BCCI, defendants had a duty to disclose their knowledge of BCCI's fraudulent operation. See Complaint, PP 1(a), 17(b) & (c), 
37. Plaintiffs' conclusory statements neither change the character of plaintiffs' claims nor establish that a special duty exists. See 
Western Mining Council v. Watt, 643 F.2d 618, 624 (9th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1031, 102 S. Ct. 567, 70 L. Ed. 2d 
474 (1981). Because the plaintiffs have failed to adequately plead a special duty, the Court finds that neither a special duty nor a 
distinct injury exists that might provide an exception to a bar of plaintiffs' derivative claims. "
999,28," The Third Circuit in Sunrise expressly declined to follow Harmsen, noting first that the result reached by the Ninth Circuit in 
Harmsen ran counter to the general rule, recognized in Harmsen, that shareholders may not recover directly for injuries 
sustained by the bank but must demonstrate injury to themselves ""as distinct from the bank."" In re Sunrise Sec. Litig., 916 F.2d 
at 886. Further, the Third Circuit observed that the result in Harmsen ""has not been adopted by other courts."" Id. at 886 & n.12 
(citing cases)."
999,29," Additionally, in pari delicto is an equitable defense. When application of the doctrine is not in the public interest, recovery is 
permitted.  In re Leasing Consultants, Inc., 592 F.2d 103, 110 (2d Cir. 1979); see In re Wedtech Corp., 88 B.R. 619, 622 (Bankr. 
S.D.N.Y. 1988) (""a trustee's ability to obtain a recovery for an estate and its blameless creditors may not be denied by the pre-
petition wrongful conduct of the debtor""). "
1000,30," In the Order, the Court required plaintiffs to ""append[] paragraph 350 of the complaint"" and ""describe the causal relationship 
between plaintiffs' alleged injury and each defendants' violation of: (i) specific predicate acts; and (ii) RICO section 1962(c) and 
(d)."" Order, P 10(M) (emphasis in original)."
1000,31," Several alleged predicate acts involving the United States banks obviously enriched BCCI rather than depleted the depositors' 
funds and could not have caused depositor losses. E.g., id., PP 350(aa) (causing defendant First American to funnel $ 220 
million to BCCI); 350(1) (causing numerous United States banks that BCCI illegally acquired or controlled to make illegal political 
contributions in order to gain political favor for BCCI). "
1001,32," Plaintiffs also allege, as predicate acts of racketeering, that BCCI bribed Peruvian bankers to obtain deposits from Peru's 
Central Bank, id., P 350(w) & (ab), and bribed a former BCCI employee in London to keep him from blowing the whistle on 
BCCI's illegal conduct, id., P 350(ab). However, to qualify as RICO predicate acts, conduct must be indictable or punishable 
under United States laws. Since bribery under 18 U.S.C. § 201 only applies to ""public officials,"" see 18 U.S.C. § 201(a)(1), a 
group to which Peruvian bankers and London BCCI employees do not belong, this conduct is not racketeering activity under 
RICO. See Peters v. Welsh Dev. Agency, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12174 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 29, 1991)."
1001,33," The fact that BCCI accepted plaintiffs' deposits, whether that transaction is characterized as legal or illegal, will always be a 
necessary element of any but-for causation link but it is not the proximate cause of plaintiffs' loss. See Brandenburg, 859 F.2d at 
1189 (""As a factual matter, plaintiffs would not have lost any interest on their deposits but for having made them in the first 
place.""). "
1002,34," For example, though plaintiffs have sought the default of deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, Noriega's alleged 
misconduct, i.e., looting the national treasury of Panama, has no nexus whatsoever to plaintiffs' losses, let alone being the 
proximate cause of their losses."
1002,35, These causal allegations were specifically ordered by the Court. See supra n.13.
1002,36," Significantly, no United States representative participated in the College of Regulators, the regulatory body that undertook 
regulation of BCCI's activities. This substantial regulatory interest by European authorities began as early as 1988, 
independently of United States regulatory activities. See Testimony of Gerald Corrigan before the House Banking Comm. (Sept. 
18, 1991) (Abu Dhabi Motion, Ex. 3)."
1002,37," Certain putative class plaintiffs' claims may never suffer injury giving rise to a RICO claim. In the United States, BCCI assets 
held by the Superintendents of Banking of New York and California are being distributed to depositors. Since available assets in 
both states far exceed potential claims and only the excess will be turned over to the foreign BCCI liquidators, no BCCI 
depositors who had money in United States offices on July 5, 1991 will lose their deposits. Similarly, depositors in Pakistan and 
Oman may not lose any of their deposits because those governments have announced their intention to insure depositor losses. "
1003,38," Additionally, plaintiffs attempt to distinguish John L. Motley Assocs., Banker's Trust, Barnett, and L'Europeene de Bangue on 
the on the grounds that, unlike the case before the Court, (1) full recovery was certain in the bankruptcy proceedings; (2) the 
trustees were appointed pursuant to an orderly scheme, e.g., the U.S. Bankruptcy laws; and (3) rulings that plaintiffs stated no 
RICO injury did not end those plaintiffs' suits. These contentions are either factually incorrect or unpersuasive."
1003,39," When a court encounters activity that is predominately foreign, it must question whether ""Congress would have wished the 
precious resources of United States courts and law enforcement agencies to be devoted to them rather than leave the problem 
to foreign countries.  Bersch v. Drexel Firestone, Inc., 519 F.2d 974, 985 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1018, 96 S. Ct. 453, 46 
L. Ed. 2d 389 (1975)."
1003,40," A motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is generally treated as a Rule 12(b)(1) ""speaking motion"" and 
summary judgment treatment under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is not required.  Trentacosta v. Frontier 
Pac. Aircraft Indus., Inc., 813 F.2d 1553, 1558 (9th Cir. 1987); see McCarthy v. United States, 850 F.2d 558 (9th Cir.), cert. 
denied, 489 U.S. 1052, 109 S. Ct. 1312, 103 L. Ed. 2d 581 (1988) (a court is not restricted to the face of the pleadings when 
considering a Rule 12(b)(1) motion but may review any evidence that might resolve factual disputes concerning the existence of 
jurisdiction). If the Court were to resolve the question of jurisdiction on either of the first two parts of the Timberlane I test, however, the 
issues might be sufficiently intertwined with the merits of the case such that the Court should afford the motion Rule 56 
treatment.  Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of Am. N.T. & S.A., 749 F.2d 1378, 1381 (9th Cir. 1984). On the other hand, refusal 
to exercise jurisdiction under the third part of the Timberlane I test need not directly implicate the merits of the case and Rule 
12(b)(1) dismissal would be proper when the case is dismissed on that basis. Id. "
1004,41," Plaintiffs' conclusion, however, that Timberlane is therefore inapplicable to this case does not follow. Many key provisions of 
RICO were patterned after the antitrust laws and are construed by analyzing antitrust jurisprudence. Thus, the Timberlane I test 
applies to plaintiffs' RICO claims."
1004,42," The Court has considered expert opinions on the enforceability of a RICO judgment in the six countries where BCCI chiefly 
operated - the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, the Grand Cayman Islands, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates - 
as well as thirty-eight additional countries. "
1005,43," Even assuming that United States deposits will be returned to the depositors without any interest for the time the funds were 
unavailable, that interest constitutes a small percentage of the 1/2 of one percent of the total BCCI deposits made in the United 
States. More importantly, that lost interest is only a minuscule portion of the deposits lost outside the United States."
1005,44," Consequently, the motion to dismiss brought by Paul C. Warnke, John F. Kovin, David I. Granger, Harold D. Murry, Jr., John 
G. Calendar, J. Griffin Lesher, Bryan Jay Yolles, Robert P. Reznick, Philip H. Hecht, and James C. Duff is not before the Court. "

that ""effective April 19, 1992, [Sun] would not renew the franchise agreements.  Similarly, Sun refuses to offer an acceptable

plaintiffs are given leave to amend the complaint."

A.) In an affidavit, Heine asserts that ""in helping the Pinecrest Homeowner's association to resist rezoning of the DeKalb tract 
from residential to commercial, my object and that of Valley Forge Center Associates was to persuade the proper Upper Merion 
Township authorities and the courts to deny Kravco's request for commercial zoning."" (Ex. A. P2) Plaintiff challenges this 
assertion on the basis of the affiant's invocation of the fifth amendment when questioned about his participation at an earlier 
stage of these proceedings.  This is a credibility issue and cannot be resolved on a motion for summary judgment. "
1035,1," During those three years, Shell increased Hinkleman's threshold volume from 160,000 gallons per month to 170,000 gallons 
per month, despite his declining actual monthly sales during that period. Hinkleman attributes his decline in sales to the 
installation of a median strip in front of his station, thereby blocking access by certain traffic, and to the opening of a state-ofthe-
art Exxon station in the immediate area."
1035,2," Hinkleman did not dispute the whole $ 1,500 amount; however, he did not make any payment on this amount until the parties 
resolved the disputed charges. "
1036,3, The parties dispute whether or not Shell had prior notice of the closing of the bank account. 
1037,4," Hinkleman contends that we should consider only the December 25 check returned for insufficient funds. The Senate Report 
on the PMPA states that ""if the franchisor waives the exercise of termination or non-renewal rights based upon a specific 
occurrence of an event, the franchisor may not thereafter base termination or non-renewal upon the specific occurrence."" S. "
1038,," Rep. No. 731, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 34 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 873, 892. Hinkleman asserts that Shell waived its 
termination rights as to delinquent payments prior to the December 25 check when it decided not to terminate after each earlier 
occurrence. In addition, Hinkleman argues that Shell's January 4 termination notice cited only the December 25 delinquency. We are not persuaded by this argument for the following reasons. First, Shell more likely preserved rather than waived its 
termination rights through its October 13 and November 30 letters. The letters expressed Shell's dissatisfaction with Hinkleman's 
late payments and, because of such, threatened automatic termination upon any similar occurrence. Second, section 
2802(b)(2)(C) permits termination for an event occurring ""not more than 120 days prior to the date on which notification of 
termination . . . is given . . . ."" Hinkleman's late payments, beginning with the September 20 returned check, occurred within 120 
days prior to the January 4 notice of termination. We, therefore, consider all occurrences prior to January 4 in determining 
whether Shell had statutory justification for terminating the franchise agreement. "
1039,5," Although we need not look to the legislative purposes for clarification of this section, our interpretation fits squarely within the 
purposes intended by Congress. In enacting the PMPA, Congress intended to balance the ""natural tensions which are created 
by this relationship,"" i.e. balance ""unfair terminations . . . by franchisors for arbitrary and even discriminatory reasons"" with 
""reasonable expectations of compliance by the franchisee with the provisions of the franchise agreement."" S. Rep. No. 731, 95th 
Cong., 2d Sess. 17-18 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 875-76. In addition, Congress expressed a need for a ""uniform set 
of rules governing the grounds for termination . . . of motor fuel marketing franchises . . . . Such a set of rules would clearly 
define the rights and obligations of the parties to the franchise relationship in the crucial area of termination of a franchise . . . ."" 
Id. at 19, reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 877."
1039,6," We recognize that there is a division among the circuits on this issue. The Sixth and Third Circuits have taken a position 
contrary to other circuits. See Marathon Petroleum Co. v. Pendleton, 889 F.2d 1509, 1512 (6th Cir. 1989) (""we must scrutinize 
the reasonableness of terminations even when an event enumerated in § 2802(c) has occurred""); Sun Refining and Marketing 
Co. v. Rago, 741 F.2d 670, 673 (3d Cir. 1984) (""we decline to construe § 2802(c) as a per se termination rule favoring 
franchisors""). "
1040,7," Section 2(e) provides: HN6[
] It shall be unlawful for any person to discriminate in favor of one purchaser against another purchaser or purchasers of 
a commodity bought for resale, with or without processing, by contracting to furnish or furnishing, or by contributing to the 
furnishing of, any services or facilities connected with the processing, handling, sale, or offering for sale of such commodity so 
purchased upon terms not accorded to all purchasers on proportionally equal terms."
1040,8," The only significant difference between the two statutes is that the Maryland statute provides a definition of ""service."" Section 
11-201(g) of the subtitle defines ""service"" as any activity performed in whole or in part for the purpose of financial gain, and includes any sale, rental, leasing, or licensing for 
use. Although, as Hinkleman points out, this definition includes leasing, it does not specify real estate leasing. Therefore, we must still 
look to the governing provisions of § 11-204(a)(5) and its federal counterpart to determine if real estate leasing is a ""service"" 
under the statute."
1040,9, Section 240.7 gives a nonexclusive list of examples of services and facilities covered by sections 2(d) and (e): Cooperative advertising; Handbills; Demonstrators and demonstrations; 
1041,," Catalogues; Cabinets; Displays; Prizes or merchandise for conducting promotional contests; Special packaging, or package sizes. The enumerated items are clearly advertising, promotional or merchandizing in nature."
1041,10," Commentators have similarly posited that § 2(e) does not apply to services outside the scope of merchandising or advertising 
services. See, e.g., Fredrick M. Rowe, Price Discrimination Under the Robinson-Patman Act 371-72 (1962); Note, The 
Distinction Between the Scope of Section 2(a) and Sections 2(d) and 2(e) of the Robinson-Patman Act, 83 Mich. L. Rev. 1584, 
1597-98 (1985). "
1042,11," Section 2(a), 15 U.S.C. § 13(a), provides: HN12[
] It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly, 
to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, . . . and where the effect of such 
discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, 
destroy, or prevent competition with any person . . . : Provided, That nothing herein contained shall prevent differentials which 
make only due allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture, sale, or delivery resulting from the differing methods or 
quantities in which such commodities are to such purchasers sold or delivered. . . ."
1042,12," Since Hinkleman did not bring charges of price discrimination under Md. Com. Law Code Ann. § 11-204(a)(3), which is similar 
to section 2(a), we do not examine his claim under that statute. "
1043,1," The terms of the variable rent program and how those terms translate into furnishing a service station on unequal terms to 
Hinkleman are detailed in the majority opinion. The posture of the case before this court requires that we assume that the 
service station was furnished by Shell on substantially unequal terms. Thus, we need only decide whether furnishing a service 
station through a lease amounts to furnishing a ""service or facility."" "
1044,2," One is left to wonder how the majority would resolve the issue if the service station that was furnished on unequal terms had 
the Shell logo painted on the front of the building. "
1053,1," We refer to Data General Corporation and its servicing subsidiary, Data General Services, Inc., herein as ""Data General."" "
1054,2," The 1976 agreement settled Data General's suit against Montgomery, the vice-president of STI and a former Data General

States v. Loew's Inc., 371 U.S. 38, 45, 48, 9 L.Ed.2d 11, 83 S.Ct. 97 n.5 (1962)."
1054,7," See, e.g., International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. 392, 396, 92 L. Ed. 20, 68 S. Ct. 12 (1947)."
1054,8," We need not and do not address Data General's arguments that it lacks ""sufficient market power in the tying product"" to impose 
an unlawful tie, Appellees' Br. at 42; that ""a valid business justification"" exists even assuming there is an otherwise illegal tying 
activity, id. at 49 n.35; and that appellants lack the ""antitrust injury"" that a private party must show in order to pursue a private 
antitrust suit, see id. at 36-37. See generally Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U.S. 328, 109 L. Ed. 2d 333, 110 
S. Ct. 1884 (1990). "
1055,9," Appellants suggest in at least one place in their brief that the tying product is not licenses to use MV/ADEX, but rather ""access 
to"" MV/ADEX. See Appellants' Br. at 19; cf. id. at 23 (""availability of MV/ADEX""). If ""access to"" MV/ADEX and repair services are 
considered to be the products in question, appellants have clearly failed to produce sufficient evidence that the products are in 
fact separate. On the record before us, demand for mere ""access to"" MV/ADEX, in contrast to demand for licenses to use 
MV/ADEX, is indistinguishable from demand for repair services. Appellants have introduced no evidence that there are 
customers who would purchase MV/ADEX-assisted diagnostic services separately from all other repair services for Data 
General equipment. Appellants appear to recognize as much and refer to the two products simply as ""MV/ADEX"" and repair 
services, not ""access to MV/ADEX"" and repair services, in the portion of their brief in which they argue that there are in fact two 
products. See id. at 22-26. "
1056,10," We HN9[
] may determine ""whether summary judgment [can] be upheld on an alternative ground where the basis chosen by 
the district court proves erroneous."" Ross v. Communications Satellite Corp., 759 F.2d 355, 363 (4th Cir. 1985); see also 
Charbonnages de France v. Smith, 597 F.2d 406, 416 & n.9 (4th Cir. 1979)."
1056,11," Section 1 of the Sherman Act, HN10[
] by terms, proscribes only ""contract[s], combination[s] . . ., or conspiracies in restraint of trade."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. Section 1 HN11[
] does not reach independent action. See, e.g., Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 768, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984); Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 
752, 761, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775, 104 S. Ct. 1464 (1984)."
1056,12," In Image Technical Serv., Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 903 F.2d 612 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. granted, 111 S. Ct. 2823 (1991), 
argued, No. 90-1029, 60 U.S.L.W. 3463 (Dec. 10, 1991), a copier equipment manufacturer ""entered into agreements with its "
1057,," equipment owners . . . that it [would] sell parts only to users 'who service only their own [copier] equipment.'"" Id. at 619 (quoting 
the manufacturer's ""Terms of Sale""). The Ninth Circuit held that such agreements constitute impermissible tying arrangements. 
See id. We reject the reasoning underlying this holding. HN13[
] It simply does not follow from the fact that a seller agrees to 
sell product A only to a certain class of customers that it has necessarily conditioned the sale of product A on an agreement not 
to purchase product B from another seller, especially where, as here, the particular class of customers to whom product A is sold 
have no need to purchase product B. Thus, even if Data General's licensing agreements explicitly stated that it would license 
MV/ADEX only to customers ""who service only their own . . . equipment,"" we would not construe such a licensing limitation as 
evidence of an impermissible tying arrangement. Provided it does so unilaterally, Data General may permissibly restrict 
MV/ADEX licenses to a particular class of customers. The Ninth Circuit also concluded that characterizing licensing actions such as Data General's as ""independent"" under the 
authority of Monsanto essentially places ""virtually all tying arrangements . . . beyond the reach of Section 1,"" in contravention of 
the Supreme Court's tying cases. Id. at 619. We disagree. HN14[
] A seller's unilateral decision to sell only to certain customers has always been independent action outside the reach of section 1. Cf.  United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 
300, 307, 63 L. Ed. 992, 39 S. Ct. 465 (1919); Laurel, 924 F.2d at 542-43. To the extent that the Ninth Circuit intended to 
suggest in this passage that Monsanto does not apply to section 1 tying claims at all, we disagree with that suggestion as well. 
Section 1 HN15[
] plainly requires a ""contract, combination . . ., or conspiracy."" 15 U.S.C.§ 1; see Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 761. If appellants are to establish an antitrust conspiracy, they must adduce evidence tending to prove that Data General's actions 
and its customers' responses to those actions were not independently undertaken."
1057,13," Under Data General's ""remoteassistance program,"" see note 14 infra, a copy of Data General diagnostic software, presumably 
MV/ADEX, is placed in the temporary possession of each enrolled service customer. See J.A. at 3052, 3057. The customer, 
however, is not licensed to use this copy of MV/ADEX. And of course, the physical placement of MV/ADEX on computer-
readable media in the possession of the customer does not effect a licensing of the software. HN19[
] ""Ownership of a 
copyright, or of any of the exclusive rights under a copyright, is distinct from ownership of any material object in which the work 
is embodied. HN20[
] Transfer of ownership of any material object . . . does not of itself convey any rights in the copyrighted work embodied in the object . . . ."" 17 U.S.C. § 202."
1057,14," In its contracts with service customers, Data General merely ""agrees to furnish . . . maintenance service"" on the customers' 
""equipment configuration."" J.A. at 3052. Data General ""installs and maintains . . . proprietary hardware, software and related 
documentation"" at the customer's site for exclusive use by Data General employees in providing maintenance services. Id. It 
""endeavors to diagnose Equipment failures prior to providing on-site service but reserves the right, where appropriate, to provide "
1058,," on-site service as the sole service resource."" Id. When performing remote diagnostic assistance, Data General ""employs"" its 
""proprietary service technology and tools"" in conjunction with ""diagnostic media"" as necessary to identify problems before 
dispatching field engineers. Id.; see also id. at 3057-58 (describing a ""remote assistance proposal"" as an addendum to the basic 
on-site service agreement)."
1058,15," HN21[
] There evidence of conspiracy is ""speculative or ambiguous,"" summary judgment is unlikely to encourage additional 
antitrust conspiracies, Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 574, and permitting trial on the basis of such evidence presents ""considerable 
danger"" that the fundamental requirement of an antitrust conspiracy ""will be seriously eroded,"" Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 763."
1058,16," Although appellants' evidence is insufficient to raise a question of material fact as to whether Data General has conditioned 
the licensing of MV/ADEX on the purchase of repair services, it may be sufficient evidence that Data General has conditioned 
access to MV/ADEX on the purchase of repair services. If access to MV/ADEX is considered the tying product, however, then 
appellants have failed to produce sufficient evidence of separate tying and tied products to withstand Data General's summary 
judgment motion. See note 9 supra. "
1061,17," It follows from our rejection of appellants' antitrust and copyright claims on the merits that the district court also properly denied 
appellants' request for a preliminary injunction. We therefore reject appellants' crossmotion. "
1067,1," The court assumes familiarity with the facts set forth in its previous order dated November 28, 1989, Capital Imaging, 725 F. 
Supp. 669, and summarizes only those necessary to the consideration of the motions now before the court. "
1069,2," In this same order, the court granted defendants' motion to dismiss Capital's section 2 Sherman Act claim pursuant to Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  In addition, the court reserved decision on Capital's state claims pending its final determination on summary 
judgment. "
1071,3," Interestingly enough, Capital has not presented this court with any evidence that any radiologist who meets the Associates' 
membership requirements has been denied membership or that, in the alternative, any radiologist who, like Capital, does not 
meet these requirements has been admitted.  Even Two Rivers which plaintiff contends is a co-conspirator with defendants has 
not been admitted to membership in the Associates."
1071,4," Antitrust enforcement agencies also consider exclusions of physicians from HMOs to be procompetitive.  See Capital Imaging, 
725 F. Supp. at 673 n.4."
1071,5," Although initially it appeared that at least one basis for plaintiff's section 1 claim was the defendants' exclusive contract with 
Two Rivers for MRI services, Capital now states that it does not allege that the MRI arrangement between defendants and Two 
Rivers was an antitrust violation or that it sustained antitrust damages because of it.  Rather, plaintiff contends that this 
arrangement is simply evidence of the purposeful anticompetitive scheme to exclude Capital from membership in the 
Associates.  See Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law at 6. "
1072,6, It is also interesting to note that Two Rivers' bid for MRI services was $ 510 while Capital's bid was $ 550. 
1074,7," This is true whether ""consumer"" is defined as the HMO's enrollees or as the primary care physicians within a 100 mile radius of 
Albany, N.Y. who make radiology referrals. "
1075,8," This 6.75% figure is based on the total number of licensed physicians in the relevant geographic market.  Obviously, not all of 
these physicians can be characterized as primary care physicians. "
1076,9," Subsequent to the commencement of this action, this principle was codified at 28 U.S.C. section 1367, effective December 1, 
1990. "
1080,1," § 366.11, Fla. Stat. (1967).  In 1974 the legislature amended chapter 366 to confer upon the PSC limited jurisdiction over 
municipally owned electric utilities for certain purposes.  Ch. 74-196, § 1, Laws of Fla.  Among the powers granted was the 
authority ""to approve territorial agreements between and among rural electric cooperatives, municipal electric utilities, and other 
electric utilities under its jurisdiction or any of them; provided, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to alter existing territorial 
agreements as between the parties to such agreements."" Id. "
1081,2," The pertinent portion of the Commission's order read: When a territorial agreement is approved by the Commission, it becomes embodied in the approving order which may only 
be modified or terminated in accordance with the Commission's express statutory purpose.  See Fuller at 1212. Therefore, 
in order to withdraw or modify Order No. 4285, Homestead must make a showing that, ""such modification or withdrawal of 
approval is necessary in the public interest because of changed conditions or circumstance not present in the proceedings 
which led to the order being modified."" Peoples Gas System, Inc. v. Mason, 187 So. 2d 335, 339 (Fla. 1966) Homestead 
has failed to allege facts sufficient to support a modification of Commission Order No. 4285 consistent with Peoples Gas 
and Fuller. Consequently, we grant FPL's motion and dismiss Homestead's petition without prejudice."
1081,3," We have jurisdiction.  Art. v, § 3(b)(2), Fla. Const. "
1082,4," If the agreement had provided for termination after a certain period of years, it would have terminated at the end of that period.  
In such case, general case law governing the modification and termination of PSC orders would have given way to the express 
terms of the order."
1082,5," The law at the time of the agreement set forth that PSC orders could be withdrawn or modified at the initiation of the PSC, a 
party to the agreement, or an interested member of the public ""after proper notice and hearing, and upon a specific finding based 
on adequate proof that such modification or withdrawal of approval is necessary in the public interest because of changed 
conditions or other circumstances not present in the proceedings which led to the order being modified."" Peoples Gas Sys., Inc.

residential customers to FPL.  Storey v. Mayo, 217 So. 2d 304, 306 (Fla. 1968), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 909, 23 L. Ed. 2d 222, 89 
S. Ct. 1751 (1969)."
1083,9," In City of Gainsville v. Board of Control, 81 So. 2d 514 (Fla. 1955), this Court held that an agreement to furnish water to the 
University of Florida without charge, in order to induce the University to locate in the City, was not terminable at will despite the 
lack of a provision as to the duration of the agreement.  The Court held that because the University had performed under the 
agreement, the agreement was to remain in effect until the University left Gainsville."
1083,10," FPL, as a regulated utility, cannot terminate the agreement without PSC approval regardless of our construction of the 
agreement.  Thus, the City is, in effect, claiming a unilateral right to terminate the agreement.  See Southern Crane Rentals, Inc. 
v. City of Gainsville, 429 So. 2d 771 (Fla. 1st DCA 1983) (a provision for the right to cancel a contract unilaterally must be 
expressly provided for in the contract). "
1084,11," The agreement provides that ""the parties acknowledge that the Company is regulated by the Florida Public Service 
Commission and that it will have to apply to the Commission for approval of this agreement."" The agreement further states that 
""if an order of the Commission is entered approving the agreement and the order becomes final, then as promptly as possible, 
each party shall transfer"" facilities and customers located in the other's service area."
1084,12, See supra note 5. 
1085,13," In re Petition of Florida Power and Light Company for a Declaratory Statement Regarding Territorial Agreement with the City 
of Homestead, 88 F.P.S.C 12:15 (1988).  The Declaratory Statement uses the phrase ""valid, binding agreement."""
1085,14," Indeed, to construe the 1974 amendment as authorizing the PSC to alter the City's termination rights under the contract by 
conditioning their exercise on a showing of good cause would constitute an impermissible impairment of contract under article 1, 
section 10 of the Florida Constitution.  See Park Benziger & Co., Inc. v. Southern Wine & Spirits, Inc., 391 So. 2d 681 (Fla. 
1980); Yamaha Parts Distribs., Inc. v. Ehrman, 316 So. 2d 557 (Fla. 1975). Although an exception to the general rule allows for 
the impairment of a contract upon a showing of an ""overriding necessity for the state to exercise its police powers,"" Park 
Benziger, 391 So. 2d at 683, there is no ""overriding necessity"" in this case because the PSC would still be required to approve 
any new territorial agreement negotiated by the parties.  See § 366.04(2)(d), Fla. Stat. (1989)."
1085,15," Public Serv. Comm'n v. Fuller, 551 So. 2d 1210 (Fla. 1989). "
1089,1," In a recent Opinion and Order, the Honorable Judge Battin granted summary judgment after finding that Tafford Oltz could, 
under no set of facts, establish damages in an amount exceeding his setoff liability from the original settlement. Plaintiff 
conceded that ""the maximum amount of damages he could prove at trial is $ 96,852.50.  When that amount is trebled, the total 
damages available to plaintiff on retrial would be a maximum of 287,557.5."" Opinion and Order of June 19, 1991 at 4.  This 
amount is subject to offset in the amount of $ 462,500.00 "

This compilation, Exhibit ""C"" of Defendant's Brief in Opposition to Second Amended Fee Petition, lists Mr. Roth's hours between 
1980 and 1986 as 1,287.27, and those of Ms. Jenkins for the same period as 1,032.40. "

1098,1," Both defendants are wholly owned subsidiaries of South Louisiana Sugar, Inc., which in turn is owned by South Coast 
Investment Company. Caneland, Inc. also a wholly owned subsidiary of Teche Sugar Company, Inc., and also executed master 
leases with landowners and subleases containing designated mill provisions with farmers."
1098,2, Raceland Sugar Mill is the wholly owned subsidiary of Teche Sugar as well. 
1099,3," Before the 1990 grinding season ended, however, Teche Sugar agreed to allow some of Breaux Brothers' cane to be taken to 
the nearby Sterling mill because the Raceland mill was unable to grind the cane quickly enough to allow the Breaux Brothers to 
get its entire crop out of the field timely. "

Planting or Accardo. "

1126,2," The actual total of unpaid invoices for ice cream may have actually been higher than this amount.  In its reply brief, Land 
O'Lakes has submitted evidence that payment for ice cream delivered on June 3, June 26 and July 8, 1987 was not made until 
October 1987. "
1128,3," All Line characterized an ongoing contractual relationship between the purchaser and seller in that case as ""a series of 
independent transactions buying and selling [the product] that were executory until completed."" All Line, 919 F.2d at 479. There 
is facially some similarity to this case, in that the purchaser in All Line was not required to buy the product.  Id.  Although the All 
Line court found the overall contract to be illusory, it also made a finding that there was no consideration for the alleged 
agreement.  Id. at 480. There having been a finding of no consideration, All Line is inapposite here.  For that same reason, 
another of Land O'Lakes' principal authorities is not controlling here.  Spiering v. Fairmont Foods Co., 424 F.2d 337 (7th Cir. 
1970). (This report's conclusion concerning consideration follows momentarily.)"
1128,4," In the cases dealing with alleged contracts for permanent employment, the question of consideration intertwines with problems 
of overcoming the presumption that employment is at will.  See Kula v. J. K. Schofield & Co., Inc., 668 F.Supp. 1126, 1132 (N.D. 
Ill. 1987). A similar presumption does not apply in this case. "
1129,5," Although neither party has raised the issue here, there is a nonstatutory partial performance exception to the statute of frauds 
which allows enforcement of a contract when a party's performance ""is such that it is impossible or impractical to return the 
performing party to the pre-performance status quo, or to compensate him for what he has parted with, or for the value of his 
performance."" Payne v. Mill Race Inn, 152 Ill.App.3d 269, 504 N.E.2d 193, 199 (2d Dist. 1987). Where this exception applies, a 
party's partial performance may enable it to seek performance of the entire contract.  See Monetti, S.P.A. v. Anchor Hocking 
Corp., 931 F.2d 1178, 1184 (7th Cir. 1991). Interestingly, the Monetti decision applied this partial performance doctrine in the 
context of a distributorship agreement that was to have a ten-year term.  In the context of an oral contract of employment, 
however, this partial performance rule has been held inapplicable.  Mapes v. Kalva Corp., 68 Ill.App.3d 362, 386 N.E.2d 148, 
152 (2d Dist. 1979). Although Fredjo's broad request for damages calls this partial performance exception to mind, the 
circumstances requisite to its application have not been demonstrated here."
1129,6," Having determined that a partial performance exception would apply under the UCC, it is unnecessary to address the parties' 
other arguments concerning the lack of a quantity term in the alleged oral contract. "
1130,7," HN12[
] Illinois courts apply a ""predominant purpose"" test in determining whether a ""mixed"" contract such as this should be 
treated as one for goods under the UCC.  Zayre Corp. v. S.M.& R. Co., Inc., 882 F.2d 1145, 1153 (7th Cir. 1989); Respect, Inc. 
v. Committee on the Status of Women, 781 F.Supp. 1358, 1363-1364 (N.D. Ill. 1992). The majority of courts classify a 
distributorship agreement as one for the sale of goods.  Babst v. FMC Corp., 661 F.Supp. 82, 87-88 (S.D. Miss. 1986). Cf.  
Monetti, S.P.A. v. Anchor Hocking Corp., 931 F.2d 1178, 1184 (7th Cir. 1991). This court concludes that the alleged agreement 
here was one for the sale of goods. "
1131,8, All paragraph references in this section of this report are to Fredjo's counterclaim.
1131,9," Land O'Lakes' decision not to investigate the reasons for the change of suppliers was allegedly based on deposition testimony 
that Warehouse had not ""passed on"" the slotting fee to Certified stores in the form of lower prices or discounts. If this testimony 
were proven true, the slotting fee would not cause lower prices to stores.  The exhibits to Land O'Lakes' reply also indicate that 
its witnesses had denied price discrimination. While deposition testimony of Fredjo's personnel indicated that they had no "
1132,," personal knowledge of Land O'Lakes' pricing policies, they described hearsay statements that Fredjo's was losing sales because 
of Land O'Lakes' lower prices to Certified."
1132,10," Documents germane to the pricing issue have been available to both sides for some time.  Over two years before the filing of 
this motion, Land O'Lakes produced invoices and documents showing prices charged Fredjo's and Warehouse. Also, 
Warehouse records have been subpoenaed.  The documentary evidence has apparently demonstrated that Warehouse was 
charged the same price for different flavors of ice cream, while Fredjo's paid different prices for different flavors.  In the case of 
some flavors, Fredjo's price was allegedly lower than the price to Warehouse. Given the dissimilarity in the method of pricing, 
Fredjo's would apparently have to demonstrate price differential by use of average prices.  Fredjo's expert has, however, 
testified that he was not engaged to compare prices."
1132,11," It is not clear when Fredjo's offered to produce the chart. Also, it is questionable whether the chart was finalized before the 
submission of pretrial order.  See Fredjo's Surreply at 1-2. "
1133,12," The promotional allowances appear to interrelate with the price discrimination claim, as evidence submitted here indicates that 
promotions might have taken the form of discounts or allowances on products purchased.  Verzak Dep. at 37-38."
1133,13," In his calculations, McFadden computed an average gross profit per account for a representative sample of Fredjo's 
customers that purchased Land O'Lakes ice cream. Gross profit on those ice cream sales was determined by subtracting the 
cost of the ice cream to Fredjo's from the price Fredjo's charged its customers, as set forth in Fredjo's Monthly Sales Analysis 
Report.  The total lost profits figure included in the final pretrial order is the average gross profit thus computed multiplied by the 
total number of Fredjo's customers. "
1134,14," Fredjo's jury instructions include the following instruction regarding lost profits: Fredjo's is entitled to recover any past or future profits it lost as a result of an antitrust violation caused by Land O'Lakes.  
This includes profits it would have made on sales it lost because of Land O'Lakes alleged violations of the Robinson-
Patman Act, as well as profits it would have made on sales at reduced prices because of Land O'Lakes alleged violation.  
Profits in this sense is net profit before taxes, and simply means the amount by which Fredjo's gross revenues would have 
exceeded all of the costs and expenses that would have been necessary to produce those revenues. Determining the amount of any loss of profits by Fredjo's, you are entitled to compare Fredjo's actual net profits in a period 
before the alleged antitrust violation with its actual net profits, or loss, thereafter, so long as you find that the earlier 
operating experience provides a reliable guide for estimating what Fredjo's actual experience would have been in the 
absence of the alleged antitrust violation. "
1135,15," Section 2(b)'s ""meeting-competition"" proviso reads as follows: HN19[
] Nothing herein contained shall prevent a seller rebutting the prima-facie case thus made by showing that his 
lower price or the furnishing of services or facilities to any purchaser or purchasers was made in good faith to meet an 
equally low price of a competitor, or the services or facilities furnished by a competitor."
1135,15, U.S.C. § 13(b).
1135,16," The practice of demanding slotting fees has apparently not been the subject of antitrust litigation, although commentators have 
noted the anti-competitive effects of the practice.  Robert J. Aalberts and L. Lynn Judd, Slotting in the Retail Grocery Business: 
Does It Violate the Public Policy Goal of Protecting Businesses Against Price Discrimination?, 40 DePaul L. Rev. 397 (1991). "
1136,17, Objections on the basis of relevancy and hearsay should be deferred until trial. 
1142,1," Although there appear to be several brokerage agreements between Merrill Lynch and Dillard, we refer to these as ""the 
agreement"" or ""the contract."""
1142,2," Security Pacific Brokers, Inc., and FCSC are subsidiaries of Security Pacific Corporation. Dillard dealt directly with Security 
Pacific Brokers, Inc., and FCSC. "
1143,3," At the time of Judge Sterling's bench rulings, it was the law of this circuit that claims under the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act 
could not be arbitrated. Thus, Judge Sterling's dismissal of Dillard's § 17(a) and rule 10b-5 claims was a necessary prerequisite 
to the arbitration order. Soon thereafter, the Supreme Court held that claims under both federal acts are subject to arbitration. 
See Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am. Express, 490 U.S. 477, 482-84, 109 S. Ct. 1917, 104 L. Ed. 2d 526 (1989) (1933 
Act); Shearson/Am. Express v. McMahon, 482 U.S. 220, 238, 107 S. Ct. 2332, 96 L. Ed. 2d 185 (1987) (1934 Act). Judge Lake 
accordingly entered an order compelling arbitration of all claims related to the trading transactions. "
1144,4," Dillard initially brought this case against Security Pacific Brokers, Inc., and FCSC. Later, as noted infra, he unsuccessfully 
attempted to add Security Pacific Corporation as a defendant."
1144,5," The false swearing, bribery, and Hobbs Act claims were brought as part of the RICO claim. "
1145,6," The contract states the following: It is agreed that any controversy between us arising out of your business or this agreement, shall be submitted to arbitration 
conducted under the provisions of the Constitution and Rules of the Board of Governors of the New York Stock Exchange, 
Inc. or pursuant to the Code of Arbitration Procedure of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., as the 
undersigned may elect. "
1146,7," Dillard argues at length that the district court improperly dismissed his complaint for failure to state a claim. Although Judge 
Sterling noted from the bench that Dillard had failed to state a claim under the federal securities laws, Judge Lake explicitly 
dismissed the complaint without prejudice pursuant to the arbitration clause."
1146,8," There is no question that Dillard's substantive claims are arbitrable. See Rodriguez de Quijas, 490 U.S. at 482-84 (1933 Act 
claims subject to arbitration); McMahon, 482 U.S. at 238 (1934 Act claims subject to arbitration); Commerce Park at DFW 
Freeport v. Mardian Constr. Co., 729 F.2d 334, 340 (5th Cir. 1984) (DTPA claims subject to arbitration). The only issue, then, is 
whether the arbitration clauses at issue in this case are enforceable."
1146,9," Under Supreme Court precedent, a party must challenge the ""'making' of the agreement to arbitrate"" itself in order to create a 
jury-triable issue.  Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395, 403-04, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1270, 87 S. Ct. 1801 
(1967). If the party makes allegations regarding the contract as a whole -- e.g., that the brokerage contract is a contract of 
adhesion -- that issue must go to arbitration. Id. In most cases in which a customer seeks to avoid arbitration by alleging that the 
contract is one of adhesion, he fails to allege specifically that the arbitration clause is adhesive. See, e.g., Bhatia, 818 F.2d at 
422. Dillard has met this threshold requirement, for he focuses specifically on the arbitration provision as an adhesive term."
1146,10," In T & R Enters., the party seeking to avoid arbitration put the existence of the arbitration agreement ""in issue"" by alleging that 
although he had signed the agreement, the true agreement between the parties was reached during a telephone conversation in 
which arbitration was not discussed. First, we rejected this argument as ""contrary to the universally prevailing rule that . . . one 
who executes a written contract is bound by its terms."" Id. We also noted that we were ""rather persuaded"" by Almacenes 
Fernandez, S.R. v. Golodetz, 148 F.2d 625, 628 (2d Cir. 1945), which held that not only must a party deny that he made an 
agreement to arbitrate, but evidence must be produced to substantiate the denial. Id. See also Interbras Cayman Co. v. Orient 
Victory Shipping Co., S.A., 663 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. 1981) (reaffirming Almecenes Fernandez). "
1147,11," Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, as amended, 15 U.S.C. § 15(a), provides that any person ""injured in his business 
or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws . . . shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained . . . ."""
1147,12," In addition to alleging that he was denied his statutory right to a jury trial, Dillard claims he was deprived of his right to a jury 
trial under the Seventh Amendment. This argument is without merit. In McMahon, the court endorsed enforcing agreements to 
arbitrate statutory claims unless congress has prohibited waiver of a judicial forum for the particular claim at issue.  482 U.S. at 
226-27. We conclude from this that the Seventh Amendment does not preclude ""waiver"" of the right to jury trial through the 
signing of a valid arbitration agreement."
1147,13," Dillard claims that he was entitled to findings of fact with regard to the denial of injunctive and declaratory relief. Fed. R. Civ. P 
52(a) requires such findings in ""actions tried upon the facts without a jury"" and with regard to ""granting or refusing interlocutory 
injunctions."" Neither situation was present in this case. First, no action was tried to the court without a jury. Judge Lake ordered 
the parties to commence arbitration; he settled no substantive claims. Second, Dillard did not make a request for an 
""interlocutory injunction."" Rather, he requested a declaratory judgment and permanent relief from his obligations under the 
arbitration clause. "
1148,14," Dillard also challenges the district court's refusal to allow him to add Merrill Lynch, Jenkens & Gilchrist, and Security Pacific 
Corporation as new party defendants. This refusal was proper, as he failed to request leave of court. In addition, Dillard attacks the district court's dismissal of his allegations and claims related to the trading transactions. Those 
claims are barred by Dillard I, however, and were properly dismissed. Finally, we do not consider the court's dismissal of 
Dillard's Hobbs Act claim, as he does not raise it as a ground for error."
1148,15," As noted supra, the 1986 case started and ended as a case against FCSC and Security Pacific Brokers, Inc."
1148,16," Under Erie R.R. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 82 L. Ed. 1188, 58 S. Ct. 817 (1938), we must evaluate the statute of limitations 
issues in accordance with Texas law. "
1149,17," See, e.g., Abbott v. Foy, 662 S.W.2d 629, 631 (Tex. App. -- Houston [14th Dist.] 1983, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (amendment cured 
defective complaint); Bradley v. Etessam, 703 S.W.2d 237 (Tex. App. -- Dallas 1985, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (amendment adding 
wrongful death cause of action related back to original complaint alleging medical malpractice)."
1149,18," There is only one sentence in the district court's opinion that touches on the issue, where the court states that ""Dillard asserts 
that because the [defamation] cause of action based upon the second indictment was timely raised in [the 1988 case], it is not 
time-barred in this action."" This is similar to Dillard's ground for error before this court. Although he does not specifically raise the 
Texas ""relation back"" statute, he does ask us to consider the ""earliest pleading in any action [as] tolling the statute"" of limitations. 
We believe this is sufficient (but just barely) to raise the ""relation back"" issue for appellate review, as Dillard asks us to consider 
""any"" pleading -- which could include earlier pleadings in the 1986 case -- in addressing the statute of limitations question. It 
appears from the district court's recitation of Dillard's argument that he did not make a similar request to the district court. We 
leave it to the district court, however, to answer this question."
1149,19," The district court held that although ""it is perhaps possible that a RICO claim may lie buried somewhere"" in Dillard's 
complaint, it could not find it. After examining Dillard's complaint, we agree and affirm the dismissal. Similarly, we affirm the dismissal of Dillard's civil rights claim, which consists of the following: ""Plaintiff additionally makes claim 
against defendants for damages to plaintiff due to . . . Title 42 violation of civil rights."" HN6[
] Mere conclusory allegations of a 
deprivation of civil rights are insufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss.  Arsenaux v. Roberts, 726 F.2d 1022, 1024 (5th Cir. 
1982). "
1150,20," In his complaint, Dillard states in his prayer for relief ""that S.I.A. would be found guilty only of anti-trust law violations."""
1150,21," As SIA notes, ""Dillard asserts that SIA disseminated information about the use of [model arbitration clauses] to its members, 
and that each member understood from that information that it could use [the model arbitration clauses] without fear of losing 
business to other brokers because all brokers would necessarily use [the model clauses] as nonnegotiable contract terms."""
1150,22," Dillard also brings a claim under section 2. His claim, however, is more appropriately considered under section 1. "
1151,23," He models his complaint after Paramount Famous Lasky Corp. v. United States, 282 U.S. 30, 75 L. Ed. 145, 51 S. Ct. 42 
(1930), in which competitors in the film industry agreed to use a standard form contract containing an arbitration clause in their 
dealings with movie theaters. If a theater owner failed to submit disputes to an industry-controlled arbitration panel, or if he 
refused to abide by an arbitration award, the industry conspirators would refuse to do business with him again until he put up a 
security deposit, arbitrated the dispute, or abided by the arbitration award."
1151,24," SIA does not contest the sufficiency of Dillard's complaint as to pleading unreasonable restraint or interstate commerce; thus, 
we do not consider these issues."
1151,25," We leave it to Judge Hughes on remand to survey the procedural landscape of this case and to decide whether Dillard's 
claims against SIA should go forward in his or another court. "
1152,26," An abatement can be either a stay or a dismissal.  Baer v. Fahnestock & Co., 565 F.2d 261, 263 (3d Cir. 1977). In this case, 
the abatement should be considered a stay, given that Judge Hughes abated the case only until the occurrence of a specific 
event -- Dillard's attempt to add his 1988 claims to the 1985 case. "
1153,27," This is because Judge Hughes did not state otherwise. In addition, Security Pacific assumes that the dismissal was with 
prejudice, as it argues alternative grounds for affirming the dismissal with prejudice, such as statute of limitations and res 
judicata."
1153,28," The West Gulf and First City cases deal with the so-called first-to-file rule, which comes into play when a plaintiff files similar 
lawsuits in two different federal districts. We have held that to avoid duplicative litigation, ""a district court may dismiss an action 
where the issues presented can be resolved in an earlier-filed action pending in another district court."" West Gulf, 751 F.2d at 
729. The first-to-file rule holds that ""in the absence of compelling circumstances, the Court initially seized of a controversy should 
be the one to decide whether it will try the case."" 909 Corp. v. Village of Bolingbrook Police Pension Fund, 741 F. Supp. 1290, 
1292 (S.D. Tex. 1990) (citation omitted). The same concern with avoiding duplicative litigation is present where similar suits 
have been filed in two courts within the same district, as is the case here. "
1158,1," Honorable Thurgood Marshall, Associate Justice Retired of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation."
1158,2," The statute provides, in relevant part: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a 
felony . . . .  15 U.S.C. § 2 (1982). "
1160,3," Trans Sport contends that the relevant market consists of the market for authorized team jackets alone, while Starter claims 
that the relevant market is the market for League apparel generally, of which, it argues, the authentic jackets are only a portion. "
1168,1," In addition to Peacock, MAJ named Mr. Craftsman, Inc. and Frank Vairo (the President of Peacock and Mr. Craftsman, Inc.) as 
defendants.  The parties have referred to the defendants collectively as ""Peacock"" throughout these proceedings, however, and 
we will continue to do so in this Opinion. "
1169,2," Following Peacock's submission of the amended countercomplaint, MAJ objected strenuously to Peacock's addition of the 
Lanham Act claim and to the variation of other claims asserted in the original countercomplaint. MAJ's objection was apparently 
founded on Peacock's failure to seek leave to add these claims pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a).  During oral argument on 
November 21, 1992, however, we made clear that we would permit Peacock to assert the new claims in light of the stated 
preference for liberal amendment under rule 15(a).  See Transcript Proceedings dated November 21, 1991 at 3 (hereinafter 
""November Transcript"")."
1169,3," MAJ has not moved to dismiss Peacock's first counterclaim, which seeks a declaration of the copyrights' invalidity.  See 
November Transcript at 23. "
1170,4," According to the amended countercomplaint, the ""Old Mr. Craftsman"" is a now-defunct corporation (    12) whose assets 
Peacock acquired in 1985 (    106).  Although the corporation's name was actually ""Mr. Craftsman, Inc.,"" the parties have 
referred to its a ""the Old Mr. Craftsman"" to distinguish it from the ""new"" Mr. Craftsman, Inc., which was formed by Peacock in 
1985 and which is named as a defendant in this action.  We follow the parties' practice of differentiating between the two 
corporations by referring to them as the ""Old Mr. Craftsman"" and the ""New Mr. Craftsman"" in this Opinion. "
1171,5," In its initial memorandum of law, MAJ argued that this Court should follow other district courts that have held that because a 
RICO action threatens the reputation of a defendant, the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b) should extend to all 
RICO predicate acts.  See MAJ's Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Dismiss at 22 (citing cases).  In the recently "
1172,," decided case of McLaughlin v. Arthur Anderson, 962 F.2d 187, No. 91-6184, slip op. at 3321 (2d Cir. April 21, 1992), however, 
the Second Circuit made clear that because ""rule 9(b) applies only to claims of fraud or mistake,"" the district court erred in 
subjecting a predicate act or extortion to its scrutiny.  In light of that clear pronouncement by the Second Circuit, we limit the 
application of rule 9(b) to the allegations of fraud under the antitrust counterclaim and mail fraud under the RICO counterclaim."
1172,6," Peacock has also alleged that MAJ obtained and maintained its monopoly by offering unlawful inducements to its customers 
and employees.  MAJ argues that such acts, even if prohibited under some other body of law, are not cognizable under the 
antitrust laws. See MAJ's Supplemental Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss at 8 (citing Data General Corp. v. 
Grumman Sys. Support Corp., 761 F. Supp. 185, 189 (D. Mass. 1991) (While illegal and unscrupulous acts are ""of concern,"" 
they ""have minimal connection to the monopolist's exercise of exclusionary powers.""); see also 3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, 
Antitrust Law P737b, at 278 (1978) (In considering whether business torts are actionable under the antitrust laws, ""the antitrust 
court must . . . insist on a preliminary showing of significant and more-than-temporary harmful effects on competition (and not 
merely upon a competitor or customer) before considering a tort as an exclusionary practice. . . .  In general, we doubt the 
wisdom of giving much § 2 attention to most of these [immoral or unethical] practices . . ., except in rare and gross cases."") 
(emphasis in the original). As we discuss in Section 2 infra, Peacock's allegations with respect to the unlawful inducements are inadequate, and we have 
granted Peacock leave to replead them.  Because we do not rely on them to sustain the antitrust claims in any event, we need 
not address at this time MAJ's argument that they may not constitute exclusionary conduct under the antitrust laws. "
1173,7," When describing the copyrights' ""limited"" exclusionary power, MAJ apparently refers to the fact that ""copyright (as opposed to 
patent) protection may, under certain circumstances, extend to two works similar or even identical in expression,"" provided the 
subsequently created work is not copied but ""is rather a product of the independent efforts of its author."" Knickerbocker Toy Co., 
Inc. v. Winterbrook Corp., 554 F. Supp. 1309, 1317 (D.N.H. 1982) (citations omitted). "
1174,8," Because MAJ's copyright registrations apparently did not deter Peacock from marketing the charm designs it acquired from the 
Old Mr. Craftsman, we assume that MAJ's allegations regarding its reluctance to enter the market refer to MAJ's practice of 
fraudulently obtaining copyrights in other public domain works.  See, e.g., PP99, 101, 145 (referring to the copying and 
copyrighting of charms copied from other competitors)."
1174,9," Peacock also suggests that it was injured because MAJ's placement of a copyright notice on its charms may have deterred 
customers from purchasing Peacock's charms out of a belief that the latter charms were infringing.  See P148.  Because, as we 
discuss in Section 3 infra, Peacock has failed to allege that MAJ's copyright notice was even visible to potential customers, this 
allegation of injury is inadequate as currently pleaded. "
1175,10," MAJ does cite one case in support of this proposition, see Aircapital Cablevision, Inc. v. Starlink Communications Group, Inc., 
634 F. Supp. 316, 322 (D. Kan. 1986) (because the plaintiff had brought at least one of the claims in its complaint in good faith, 
the lawsuit did not become ""sham"" ""even if the [copyright] infringement claims were included spuriously"").  While this Court is not 
bound by a decision of the District of Kansas, we note that in Aircapital, the predicate lawsuit had already been resolved, and the 
trial court therefore had a much better sense of whether or not it was brought in good faith.  In light of the fact that discovery has 
not even closed in this action, this Court is confronted with an entirely different factual situation. "
1176,11," Because Peacock has attached these copyright registrations to the amended countercomplaint and referred to them in its 
allegations, the amended pleadings are deemed to include them for the purposes of Rule 12(b)(6).  See Goldman v. Belden, 754 
F.2d 1059, 1065-66 (2d Cir. 1985). "
1179,12," Section 1346 provides, ""For purposes of this chapter, the term 'scheme or artifice to defraud' includes a scheme or artifice to 
deprive another of the intangible right of honest services."" "
1180,13," MAJ's memoranda of law attacked the RICO counterclaim on a number of additional grounds, including a claim that it was 
barred by the statute of limitations and that any injury deriving from the alleged provision of cocaine and prostitutes to MAJ's 
customers was insufficient to confer standing on Peacock.  See MAJ's Supplemental Memorandum in Support of Motion to 
Dismiss at 16-17.  Because we have found many of the RICO allegations inadequate and have dismissed the counterclaim for 
failure to plead the requisite predicate acts, we decline to reach these objections unless and until Peacock submits an amended 
pleading."
1180,14," The case of Kregos v. Associated Press, 937 F. 2d 700 (2d Cir. 1991), cited by MAJ, is not to the contrary.  Although the 
Kregos Court affirmed the dismissal of a Lanham Act violation based on the plaintiff's claim that the defendant placed its own 
copyright notice on an allegedly infringing good, it made clear that its decision was based on the plaintiff's failure to allege that 
the defendant's copyright notice was false or that the underlying matter ""originated from any source other than [the defendant]."" 
Id. at 710-11. In this case, by contrast, Peacock's pleadings are replete with allegations that MAJ's copyright registrations were 
fraudulently obtained and that MAJ copied the copyrighted matter rather than creating it independently. "
1186,1, The State of Michigan and the Michigan Public Service Commission also intervened in No. 91-1025 but filed no brief.
1186,2," As cost-based rates should in principle be virtually identical to the real costs of electricity incurred by a joint owner for the power 
it receives by virtue of its ownership interest, it is not clear what advantage would accrue to the Group from securing the interest "
1187,," it desires. Counsel for Consumers suggested at oral argument that the advantage was due to the tax-exempt status of the 
publicly owned entities making up the Group, but we find nothing in the record on the matter."
1187,3," In an order that is not under review, FERC accepted the original PPA rate proposal for filing and set a hearing to determine its 
lawfulness. See Palisades Generating Co., 48 F.E.R.C. Par. 61,144, at 61,575 (1989) (Original PPA Rate Order). In April 1990 
Palisades Genco filed a minor amendment to the PPA, and at that point the Group raised its allegations that the PPA had 
anticompetitive consequences. It is the Commission's actions in response to this amendment that we refer to herein as the ""PPA 
Rate"" orders. "
1190,4," We are told that Consumers filed a new and even more liberal transmission tariff with FERC on February 27, 1992."
1190,5," The Group's claims display the rudiments of an ""essential facility"" theory of antitrust violation. See generally P. Areeda & H. 
Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law Par. 736.1-.2, at 784-832 (1991 Supp.). But despite ample opportunities, the Group has failed to 
articulate how its allegations satisfy the elements of this rather confused doctrine, see id. Par. 736.2a, at 806-07, and particularly 
why the doctrine might apply when a regulated monopolist freely offers its services at terms approved by the regulator and 
refuses only to sell an ownership interest to its competitors. See id. Par. 736.1b, at 787 (""Even the most ardent interventionist 
does not usually claim that an individual monopoly should be required to sell an equity interest in itself to actual or would-be 
competitors.""); cf.  Otter Tail Power Co., 410 U.S. at 371-79 (affirming federal court's power to order interconnections at 
reasonable terms to remedy a monopolist's outright refusal to sell or transmit power)."
1190,6," The Commission did not specifically discuss the Group's most concrete allegation - that Consumers would use the securities 
proceeds in part to construct a new transmission line to Indiana in which it had offered to let an investor-owned utility (pursuant 
to an old agreement) but not Group members invest. The Commission's expressed rationale, however, clearly covers the matter: 
the Group's argument was framed in terms of a right to co-ownership, and any claim that Group members could not obtain 
access to the line was premature since the line had yet to be built. The Commission has since made this reasoning explicit in a 
proceeding directly related to the new line. See PSI Energy, Inc. and Consumers Power Co., 55 F.E.R.C. Par. 61,254, at 61,811 
(1991), rehearing denied, 56 F.E.R.C. Par. 61,237, at 61,911-12 & n.31 (1991). Petitions for review of the orders in that 
proceeding have been held in abeyance pending our decision in this case. See Michigan Municipal Cooperative Group v. FERC, 
No. 91-1388 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 5, 1991). "
1191,7," FERC and the intervenors also question the Group's standing to pursue these two petitions for review. We think that the Group 
members are aggrieved in essentially the same way by these decisions as by the Securities orders, and again rely on City of 
Lafayette, 454 F.2d at 947-48, to hold that petitioners have standing under 16 U.S.C. § 825l(b). "
1192,8," FERC left the hearing open to several issues that the Group seeks to raise before us involving potential self-dealing between 
Consumers and Palisades Genco and the legality of rates not based on historic costs and subject to annual FERC review. See, 
e.g., PPA Rate Rehearing, 53 F.E.R.C. at 61,988-89. Those issues are clearly not final and we do not address them further. See 
Papago, 628 F.2d at 239-40. We consider below only the portions of the Commission's orders dealing with the Group's 
anticompetitiveness charges."
1192,9," The Gulf States standard also governs the merits of the Facility Transfer and PPA Rate orders. See Gulf States, 411 U.S. at 
758-59 (dicta); see also FPC v. Conway Corp., 426 U.S. 271, 279, 48 L. Ed. 2d 626 , 96 S. Ct. 1999 (1976)."
1192,10," Consumers did discuss providing transmission services to Palisades Genco in the settlement negotiations with Bechtel, and 
Consumers and Palisades Genco apparently either entered into or contemplated entering into a ""Transmission Services 
Commitment Agreement."" Original PPA Rate Order, 48 F.E.R.C. at 61,571 n.3. FERC does not mention this agreement (which 
we cannot find in the joint appendix) in its later orders, perhaps because it was not in fact executed or was rendered irrelevant, 
at least in the near future, by the long-term output PPA. "
1198,*," Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation."
1198,1, The case against Dr. Wexler was dismissed with prejudice after day twelve of the jury trial. 
1200,2," Plaintiff's counsel subsequent to argument has cited the court to Bouley v. Continental Casualty Co., 454 F.2d 85 (1st Cir. 
1972). However, our unbroken line of cases make it clear that HN4[
] insufficient compliance with Rule 51 will be overlooked only in exceptional cases or under peculiar circumstances to prevent a clear miscarriage of justice.  Coy v. Simpson Marine 
Safety Equip., Inc., 787 F.2d 19, 26 (1st Cir. 1986). This is not such a case. "
1201,3," Fed. R. Evid. 611(c) HN10[
] states in pertinent part: Leading questions should not be used on the direct examination of a witness except as may be necessary to develop the 
witness' testimony. Ordinarily leading questions should be permitted on cross-examination. When a party calls . . . an adverse 
party, . . . interrogation may be by leading questions. (Emphasis added). "
1202,4," During Dr. Robinson's testimony, he stated that, in writing a negative letter about plaintiff which was placed in plaintiff's file at 
Miriam Hospital, he had relied to some extent on information received from Dr. Issenberg."
1202,5," Plaintiff also argues that the court should have admitted the letter under the ""catch-all exception."" Fed. R. Evid. 803(24). 
Because plaintiff failed to offer proof in the court below that the requirements of Rule 803(24) were met, we deem this claim 
waived. See Fed. R. Evid. 103(a)(2). "
1203,6, We also note that the letter's substance did find its way into evidence through plaintiff's uncontradicted testimony. 
1208,1," The work preservation clause reads as follows: The City of Seward (""the Employer"") agrees that, to the extent permitted by law, (including 29 U.S.C. § 158(e)), it will not 
contract for or allow the subcontract for the construction of the 115 kv main electrical transmission intertie line between Lawing 
and Fort. Raymond [substations] for work traditionally performed by employees represented by the International Brotherhood of 
Electrical Workers, Local Union 1547 (""IBEW"") except to a person, firm, or corporation that is a party to an appropriate current 
labor agreement with IBEW. "
1210,2," The Contractors do not dispute that the clause pursuant to which Seward acted would be a valid work preservation agreement 
if entered into by a private employer. "
1211,3," Glenwood Bridge, Inc. v. City of Minneapolis, 940 F.2d 367, 370 (8th Cir. 1991), a case which followed Boston Harbor, is 
distinguishable for the same reason. The City of Minneapolis was not acting as a public employer since it did not own a public 
company and employ workers who traditionally performed the type of work at issue. Rather, Minneapolis, like the MWRA, was 
placed in charge of a project that required the hiring of workers, and in order to ensure smooth labor relations, it entered into a 
stability agreement with a specific union. Because Boston Harbor and Glenwood Bridge are distinguishable, we need not take a position on the merits of those cases. 
Boston Harbor was decided by an en banc panel of the First Circuit that split 3-2; the Glenwood Bridge panel split 2-1. A petition 
for certiorari in Boston Harbor is currently pending before the Supreme Court."
1211,4," The work preservation clause did not extend beyond the bargaining unit. See Letter of Agreement Relating to Seward Inertie 
Project (""This provision is designed and intended to preserve work traditionally performed by employees represented by IBEW 
whose wages, hours, and conditions of employment are prescribed by this Agreement.""). The stipulated facts show that 
Seward's own employees who are represented by the IBEW have done the work on major improvements to Seward's electrical 
system, including at least twenty different electrical transmission line projects in recent years. The stipulated facts also show that 
the renovation of the power line is directly related to the work done by Seward's employees, that is, the maintenance of the 
power line. It is not disputed that if Seward had had the heavy equipment necessary to undertake the project, it would have used 
its own utility employees to do the work. "
1212,5," In the alternative, the City and the IBEW argue that the summary judgment on the antitrust claim can be affirmed on the basis 
of the governmental action exception to the Sherman Act. We need not reach this argument. "
1213,1," In deciding that insufficient indicia of an employment relationship existed in Boston Harbor, the court considered the facts 
establishing whether an independent contracting relationship existed between the MWRA and its employees. It found that under 
the standard for determining independent contractor status, the relationship between the construction workers and the MWRA 
was a contractual, not an employment, relationship. It reached this conclusion by finding that the MWRA did not have the right to 
control the laborers' performance, nor did it pay their salaries, provide pension or other benefits, or make FICA payments on 
their behalf.  Id. at 355, n. 17. Here, the parties did not have opportunity to explore the relationship between the City of Seward and its own employees to the 
extent that the Boston Harbor parties did. Because the majority fails to provide any evidence that the City acted as an employer 
here, it is hard to accept the conclusion that it did."
1213,2," Under normal circumstances, employers may not enter into pre-hire agreements. Congress made an exception for private 
employers in the construction industry. To allow a state entity, which cannot be an employer under the NLRA, to be considered 
an employer for purposes of this exception is ""fancy judicial foot work at its nimblest."" Id. "
1214,3," Specification 13.1 in Boston Harbor, like the work preservation clause between the City and the IBEW, limited bidding on the 
MWRA's project to those contractors who agreed to hire only union laborers. The Boston Harbor court found that the NLRA 
preempted Specification 13.1 because it directly regulated the bargaining process. The court stated, ""where interference into the 
collective bargaining process by the state is direct, an asserted state interest of the type at issue here, whether 'proprietary' or 
otherwise, cannot justify the interference."" Id. at 359. As in Boston Harbor, our inquiry should focus on whether the City's action 
has the effect of regulating the collective bargaining process, rather than on what the City's motives were in agreeing to a work 
preservation clause. "

1243,1," Kodak's micrographic equipment includes four different product areas. The first is capture products such as microfilmers and 
electronic scanners, which compact an image and capture it on microfilm. The second is equipment such as microfilm viewers 
and viewer/printers. This equipment is used to retrieve the images. The third is Computer Output Microform (COM) recorders, 
which are data-processing peripherals that record computer-generated data onto microfilm. The fourth is Computer Assisted 
Retrieval (CAR) systems, which utilize computers to locate and retrieve micrographic images. See App. 156-158."
1243,2," In addition to the OEM's, other sources of Kodak parts include (1) brokers who would buy parts from Kodak, or strip used 
Kodak equipment to obtain the useful parts and resell them, (2) customers who buy parts from Kodak and make them available 
to ISO's, and (3) used equipment to be stripped for parts. See id., at 419, 517; Brief for Petitioner 38. "
1244,3," Section 1 of the Sherman Act states in relevant part: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or 
conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" 15 U. 
S. C. § 1 (1988 ed., Supp. II). Section 2 of the Sherman Act states: ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire 
with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign 
nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $ 10,000,000 if a 
corporation, or, if any other person, $ 350,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding three years, or by both said punishments, in 
the discretion of the court."" 15 U. S. C. § 2 (1988 ed., Supp. II). "
1245,4," Specifically, the Court of Appeals explained that the District Court had denied the request for further discovery made by 
respondents in their opposition to Kodak's summary judgment motion: ""For example, [respondents] requested to depose two 
ISO customers who allegedly would not sign accurate statements concerning Kodak's market power in the parts market. Not 
finding it necessary to reach the market power issue in its decision, the district court, of course, had no reason to grant this 
request."" 903 F.2d at 617, n. 4. "
1246,5," The Court of Appeals found: ""Kodak's policy of allowing customers to purchase parts on condition that they agree to service 
their own machines suggests that the demand for parts can be separated from the demand for service."" Id., at 616."
1246,6," Amicus briefs filed by various service organizations attest to the magnitude of the service business. See, e. g., Brief for 
Computer Service Network International as Amicus Curiae; Brief for National Electronics Sales and Service Dealers Association 
as Amicus Curiae; Brief for California State Electronics Association et al. as Amici Curiae; Brief for National Office Machine 
Dealers et al. as Amici Curiae."
1246,7," LEdHN[7B][
] [7B] The dissent suggests that parts and service are not separate products for tying purposes because all service may involve 
installation of parts. Post, at 494-495, n. 2. Because the record does not support this factual assertion, under the approach of 
both the Court and the concurrence in Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 
(1984), Kodak is not entitled to summary judgment on whether parts and service are distinct markets."
1246,8," LEdHN[8B][
] [8B] In a footnote, Kodak contends that this practice is only a unilateral refusal to deal, which does not violate the antitrust laws. See 
Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 4. Assuming, arguendo, that Kodak's refusal to sell parts to any company providing service can be 
characterized as a unilateral refusal to deal, its alleged sale of parts to third parties on condition that they buy service from 
Kodak is not. See 903 F.2d at 619."
1246,9," [****25]   LEdHN[10B][
] [10B] "
1247,," ""The essential characteristic of an invalid tying arrangement lies in the seller's exploitation of its control over the tying product to 
force the buyer into the purchase of a tied product that the buyer either did not want at all, or might have preferred to purchase 
elsewhere on different terms. When such 'forcing' is present, competition on the merits in the market for the tied item is 
restrained and the Sherman Act is violated."" Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 12."
1247,10," In their brief and at oral argument, respondents argued that Kodak's market share figures for high-volume copy machines, 
CAR systems, and micrographic-capture equipment demonstrate Kodak's market power in the equipment market. Brief for 
Respondents 16-18, 32-33; Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-31. In the Court of Appeals, however, respondents did not contest Kodak's assertion that its market shares indicated a competitive 
equipment market. The Court of Appeals believed that respondents ""do not dispute Kodak's assertion that it lacks market power 
in the [equipment] markets."" 903 F.2d at 616, n. 3. Nor did respondents question Kodak's asserted lack of market power in their 
brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari, although they acknowledged that Kodak's entire case rested on its understanding 
that respondents were not disputing the existence of competition in the equipment market. Brief in Opposition 8. LEdHN[11B][
] [11B] LEdHN[12B][
] [12B]Recognizing that HN4[
] on summary judgment we may examine the record de 
novo without relying on the lower courts' understanding, United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655, 8 L. Ed. 2d 176, 82 S. 
Ct. 993 (1962), respondents now ask us to decline to reach the merits of the questions presented in the petition, and instead to 
affirm the Ninth Circuit's judgment based on the factual dispute over market power in the equipment market. We decline 
respondents' invitation. We stated in Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 816, 85 L. Ed. 2d 791, 105 S. Ct. 2427 (1985): ""Our 
decision to grant certiorari represents a commitment of scarce judicial resources with a view to deciding the merits of one or 
more of the questions presented in the petition."" Because respondents failed to bring their objections to the premise underlying 
the questions presented to our attention in their opposition to the petition for certiorari, we decide those questions based on the 
same premise as the Court of Appeals, namely, that competition exists in the equipment market. "
1248,11," Kodak argues that such a rule would be per se, with no opportunity for respondents to rebut the conclusion that market power 
is lacking in the parts market. See Brief for Petitioner 30-31 (""There is nothing that respondents could prove that would 
overcome Kodak's conceded lack of market power""); id., at 30 (discovery is ""pointless"" once the ""dispositive fact"" of lack of 
market power in the equipment market is conceded); id., at 22 (Kodak's lack of market power in the equipment market ""dooms 
any attempt to extract monopoly profits"" even in an allegedly imperfect market); id., at 25 (it is ""impossible"" for Kodak to make 
more total profit by overcharging its existing customers for service). As an apparent second-best alternative, Kodak suggests elsewhere in its brief that the rule would permit a defendant to meet its 
summary judgment burden under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c); the burden would then shift to the plaintiffs to ""prove . . . 
that there is specific reason to believe that normal economic reasoning does not apply."" Brief for Petitioner 30. This is the United 
States' position. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 10-11."

1249,15," What constrains the defendant's ability to raise prices in the service market is ""the elasticity of demand faced by the defendant 
-- the degree to which its sales fall . . . as its price rises."" Areeda & Kaplow P342(c), p. 576. LEdHN[15B][
] [15B]Courts usually have considered the relationship between price in one market and demand in another in 
defining the relevant market. Because market power is often inferred from market share, market definition generally determines 
the result of the case. Pitofsky, New Definitions of Relevant Market and the Assault on Antitrust, 90 Colum. L. Rev. 1805, 1806-
1813 (1990). Kodak chose to focus on market power directly rather than arguing that the relationship between equipment and 
service and parts is such that the three should be included in the same market definition. Whether considered in the conceptual 
category of ""market definition"" or ""market power,"" the ultimate inquiry is the same -- whether competition in the equipment 
market will significantly restrain power in the service and parts markets."
1249,16," The United States as amicus curiae in support of Kodak echoes this argument: ""The ISOs' claims are implausible because 
Kodak lacks market power in the markets for its copier and micrographic equipment. Buyers of such equipment regard an "
1250,," increase in the price of parts or service as an increase in the price of the equipment, and sellers recognize that the revenues 
from sales of parts and service are attributable to sales of the equipment. In such circumstances, it is not apparent how an 
equipment manufacturer such as Kodak could exercise power in the aftermarkets for parts and service."" Brief for United States 
as Amicus Curiae 8."
1250,17," It is clearly true, as the United States claims, that Kodak ""cannot set service or parts prices without regard to the impact on the 
market for equipment."" Id., at 20. The fact that the cross-elasticity of demand is not zero proves nothing; the disputed issue is 
how much of an impact an increase in parts and service prices has on equipment sales and on Kodak's profits."
1250,18," Although Kodak repeatedly relies on Continental T. V. as support for its factual assertion that the equipment market will 
prevent exploitation of the service and parts markets, the case is inapposite. In Continental T. V., the Court found that a 
manufacturer's policy restricting the number of retailers that were permitted to sell its product could have a procompetitive effect. 
See 433 U.S. at 55. The Court also noted that any negative effect of exploitation of the intrabrand market (the competition 
between retailers of the same product) would be checked by competition in the interbrand market (competition over the same 
generic product) because consumers would substitute a different brand of the same product. Unlike Continental T. V., this case 
does not concern vertical relationships between parties on different levels of the same distribution chain. In the relevant market, 
service, Kodak and the ISO's are direct competitors; their relationship is horizontal. The interbrand competition at issue here is 
competition over the provision of service. Despite petitioner's best effort, repeating the mantra ""interbrand competition"" does not 
transform this case into one over an agreement the manufacturer has with its dealers that would fall under the rubric of 
Continental T. V. "

1251,20," In addition, of course, in order to price accurately the equipment, a consumer would need initial purchase information such as 
prices, features, quality, and available warranties for different machinery with different capabilities, and residual value 
information such as the longevity of product use and its potential resale or trade-in value."
1251,21," To inform consumers about Kodak, the competitor must be willing to forgo the opportunity to reap supracompetitive prices in 
its own service and parts markets. The competitor may anticipate that charging lower service and parts prices and informing 
consumers about Kodak in the hopes of gaining future equipment sales will cause Kodak to lower the price on its service and 
parts, canceling any gains in equipment sales to the competitor and leaving both worse off. Thus, in an equipment market with 
relatively few sellers, competitors may find it more profitable to adopt Kodak's service and parts policy than to inform the 
consumers. See 2 Areeda & Turner, Antitrust Law P404b1; App. 177 (Kodak, Xerox, and IBM together have nearly 100% of 
relevant market). "
1252,," Even in a market with many sellers, any one competitor may not have sufficient incentive to inform consumers because the 
increased patronage attributable to the corrected consumer beliefs will be shared among other competitors. Beales, Craswell, &

1253,24," The dissent disagrees based on its hypothetical case of a tie between equipment and service. ""The only thing lacking"" to bring 
this case within the hypothetical case, states the dissent, ""is concrete evidence that the restrictive parts policy was . . . generally 
known."" Post, at 492. But the dissent's ""only thing lacking"" is the crucial thing lacking -- evidence. Whether a tie between parts 
and service should be treated identically to a tie between equipment and service, as the dissent and Kodak argue, depends on 
whether the equipment market prevents the exertion of market power in the parts market. Far from being ""anomalous,"" post, at 
492-493, requiring Kodak to provide evidence on this factual question is completely consistent with our prior precedent. See, e. 
g., n. 13, supra."
1253,25," Cf.  Instructional Systems, 817 F.2d at 646 (finding the conspiracy reasonable under Matsushita because its goals were in fact 
achieved)."
1253,26, It bears repeating that in this case Kodak has never claimed that it is in fact pursuing such a pricing strategy. 
1254,27," See Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 12 (""Buyers often find package sales attractive; a seller's decision to offer such packages 
can merely be an attempt to compete effectively -- conduct that is entirely consistent with the Sherman Act""). See also Yates & 
DiResta, Software Support and Hardware Maintenance Practices: Tying Considerations, The Computer Lawyer, Vol. 8, No. 6, p. 
17 (1991) (describing various service and parts policies that enhance quality and sales but do not violate the antitrust laws)."
1254,28," Two of the largest consumers of service and parts contend that they are worse off when the equipment manufacturer also 
controls service and parts. See Brief for State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. et al. as Amici Curiae; Brief for State of 
Ohio et al. as Amici Curiae."
1254,29," LEdHN[21B][
] [21B] The dissent urges a radical departure in this Court's antitrust law. It argues that because Kodak has only an ""inherent"" 
monopoly in parts for its equipment, post, at 489-490, the antitrust laws do not apply to its efforts to expand that power into other 
markets. The dissent's proposal to grant per se immunity to manufacturers competing in the service market would exempt a vast 
and growing sector of the economy from antitrust laws. Leaving aside the question whether the Court has the authority to make 
such a policy decision, there is no support for it in our jurisprudence or the evidence in this case. Even assuming, despite the absence of any proof from the dissent, that all manufacturers possess some inherent market power 
in the parts market, it is not clear why that should immunize them from the antitrust laws in another market. The Court has held 
many times that HN6[
] power gained through some natural and legal advantage such as a patent, copyright, or business 
acumen can give rise to liability if ""a seller exploits his dominant position in one market to expand his empire into the next."" 
Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 611, 97 L. Ed. 1277, 73 S. Ct. 872 (1953); see, e. g., Northern 
Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545, 78 S. Ct. 514 (1958); United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334

(1938). Moreover, on the occasions when the Court has considered tying in derivative aftermarkets by manufacturers, it has not 
adopted any exception to the usual antitrust analysis, treating derivative aftermarkets as it has every other separate market. See 
International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. 392, 92 L. Ed. 20, 68 S. Ct. 12 (1947); International Business Machines Corp. v. 
United States, 298 U.S. 131, 80 L. Ed. 1085, 56 S. Ct. 701 (1936); United Shoe Machinery Corp. v. United States, 258 U.S. 451, 
66 L. Ed. 708, 42 S. Ct. 363 (1922). Our past decisions are reason enough to reject the dissent's proposal. See Patterson v. 
McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 172-173, 105 L. Ed. 2d 132, 109 S. Ct. 2363 (1989) (""Considerations of stare decisis have 
special force in the area of statutory interpretation, for here, unlike in the context of constitutional interpretation, the legislative 
power is implicated, and Congress remains free to alter what we have done""). Nor does the record in this case support the dissent's proposed exemption for aftermarkets. The dissent urges its exemption 
because the tie here ""does not permit the manufacturer to project power over a class of consumers distinct from that which it is 
already able to exploit (and fully) without the inconvenience of the tie."" Post, at 498. Beyond the dissent's obvious difficulty in 
explaining why Kodak would adopt this expensive tying policy if it could achieve the same profits more conveniently through 
some other means, respondents offer an alternative theory, supported by the record, that suggests Kodak is able to exploit some 
customers who in the absence of the tie would be protected from increases in parts prices by knowledgeable customers. See 
supra, at 475-476. "
1255,," At bottom, whatever the ultimate merits of the dissent's theory, at this point it is mere conjecture. Neither Kodak nor the dissent 
have provided any evidence refuting respondents' theory of forced unwanted purchases at higher prices and price 
discrimination. While it may be, as the dissent predicts, that the equipment market will prevent any harms to consumers in the 
aftermarkets, the dissent never makes plain why the Court should accept that theory on faith rather than requiring the usual 
evidence needed to win a summary judgment motion."
1255,30," Kodak erroneously contends that this Court in Du Pont rejected the notion that a relevant market could be limited to one 
brand. Brief for Petitioner 33. The Court simply held in Du Pont that one brand does not necessarily constitute a relevant market 
if substitutes are available.  351 U.S. at 393. See also Boxing Club, 358 U.S. at 249-250. Here respondents contend there are 
no substitutes."
1255,31," Other courts have limited the market to parts for a particular brand of equipment. See, e. g., International Logistics Group, Ltd. 
v. Chrysler Corp., 884 F.2d 904, 905, 908 (CA6 1989) (parts for Chrysler cars is the relevant market), cert. denied, 494 U.S.

modified, 810 F.2d 1517 (1987) (service for Bell & Howell equipment is the relevant market); In re General Motors Corp., 99 F.

2d 792, 98 S. Ct. 1282 (1978). "
1256,32," LEdHN[25B][
] [25B] It is true that HN10[
] as a general matter a firm can refuse to deal with its competitors. But such a right is not absolute; it exists 
only if there are legitimate competitive reasons for the refusal. See Aspen Skiing Co., 472 U.S. at 602-605. "
1257,33," Kodak claims that both Continental T. V. and Monsanto support its free-rider argument. Neither is applicable. In both 
Continental T. V., 433 U.S. at 55, and Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 762-763, the Court accepted free-riding as a justification because 
without restrictions a manufacturer would not be able to induce competent and aggressive retailers to make the kind of 
investment of capital and labor necessary to distribute the product. In Continental T. V. the relevant market level was retail sale 
of televisions and in Monsanto retail sales of herbicides. Some retailers were investing in those markets; others were not, 
relying, instead, on the investment of the other retailers. To be applicable to this case, the ISO's would have to be relying on 
Kodak's investment in the service market; that, however, is not Kodak's argument. "
1260,1," That there exist innumerable parts and service firms in such industries as the automobile industry, see Brief for Automotive 
Warehouse Distributors Association et al. as Amici Curiae 2-3, does not detract from this point. The question whether power to 
control an aftermarket exists is quite distinct from the question whether the power has been exercised. Manufacturers in some "
1261,," markets have no doubt determined that exclusionary intrabrand conduct works to their disadvantage at the competitive 
interbrand level, but this in no way refutes the self-evident reality that control over unique replacement parts for single-branded 
goods is ordinarily available to such manufacturers for the taking. It confounds sound analysis to suggest, as respondents do, 
see Brief for Respondents 5, 37, that the asserted fact that Kodak manufactures only 10% of its replacement parts, and 
purchases the rest from original equipment manufacturers, casts doubt on Kodak's possession of an inherent advantage in the 
aftermarkets. It does no such thing, any more than Kodak's contracting with others for the manufacture of all constituent parts 
included in its original equipment would alone suggest that Kodak lacks power in the interbrand micrographic and photocopying 
equipment markets. The suggestion implicit in respondents' analysis -- that if a seller chooses to contract for the manufacture of 
its branded merchandise, it must permit the contractors to compete in the sale of that merchandise -- is plainly unprecedented."
1261,2," Even with interbrand power, I may observe, it is unlikely that Kodak could have incrementally exploited its position through the 
tie of parts to service alleged here. Most of the ""service"" at issue is inherently associated with the parts, i. e., that service 
involved in incorporating the parts into Kodak equipment, and the two items tend to be demanded by customers in fixed 
proportions (one part with one unit of service necessary to install the part). When that situation obtains, ""'no revenue can be 
derived from setting a higher price for the tied product which could not have been made by setting the optimum price for the 
tying product.'"" P. Areeda & L. Kaplow, Antitrust Analysis P426(a), p. 706 (4th ed. 1988) (quoting Bowman, Tying Arrangements 
and the Leverage Problem, 67 Yale L. J. 19 (1957)). These observations strongly suggest that Kodak parts and the service 
involved in installing them should not be treated as distinct products for antitrust tying purposes. See Jefferson Parish Hospital 
Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 39, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 (1984) (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment) (""For 
products to be treated as distinct, the tied product must, at a minimum, be one that some consumers might wish to purchase 
separately without also purchasing the tying product"") (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted); Ross, The Single Product Issue 
in Antitrust Tying: A Functional Approach, 23 Emory L. J. 963, 1009-1010 (1974). "
1263,3," The Court insists that the record in this case suggests otherwise, i. e., that a tie between parts and service somehow does 
enable Kodak to increase overall monopoly profits. See ante, at 479-481, n. 29. Although the Court does not identify the record 
evidence on which it relies, the suggestion, apparently, is that such a tie facilitates price discrimination between sophisticated, 
""high-volume"" users of Kodak equipment and their unsophisticated counterparts. The sophisticated users (who, the Court 
presumes, invariably self-service their equipment) are permitted to buy Kodak parts without also purchasing supracompetitively 
priced Kodak service, while the unsophisticated are -- through the imposition of the tie -- compelled to buy both. See ante, at 
475-476. While superficially appealing, at bottom this explanation lacks coherence. Whether they self-service their equipment or not, 
rational foremarket consumers (those consumers who are not yet ""locked in"" to Kodak hardware) will be driven to Kodak's 
competitors if the price of Kodak equipment, together with the expected cost of aftermarket support, exceeds competitive levels. 
This will be true no matter how Kodak distributes the total system price among equipment, parts, and service. See supra, at 495. 
Thus, as to these consumers, Kodak's lack of interbrand power wholly prevents it from employing a tie between parts and 
service as a vehicle for price discrimination. Nor does a tie between parts and service offer Kodak incremental exploitative power 
over those consumers -- sophisticated or not -- who have the supposed misfortune of being ""locked in"" to Kodak equipment. If 
Kodak desired to exploit its circumstantial power over this wretched class by pressing them up to the point where the cost to 
each consumer of switching equipment brands barely exceeded the cost of retaining Kodak equipment and remaining subject to 
Kodak's abusive practices, it could plainly do so without the inconvenience of a tie, through supracompetitive parts pricing alone. 
Since the locked-in sophisticated parts purchaser is as helpless as the locked-in unsophisticated one, I see nothing to be gained 
by price discrimination in favor of the former. If such price discrimination were desired, however, it would not have to be 
accomplished indirectly, through a tie of parts to service. Section 2(a) of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U. S. C. § 13(a), would 
prevent giving lower parts prices to the sophisticated customers only ""where the effect of such discrimination may be 
substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent 
competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of 
either of them . . . ."" Ibid.; see, e. g., Falls City Industries, Inc. v. Vanco Beverage, Inc., 460 U.S. 428, 434-435, 75 L. Ed. 2d 174, 
103 S. Ct. 1282 (1983). That prohibited effect often occurs when price-discriminated goods are sold for resale (i. e., to 
purchasers who are necessarily in competition with one another).  E. g., FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. 37, 47, 92 L. Ed. 
1196, 68 S. Ct. 822 (1948); see P. Areeda & L. Kaplow, Antitrust Analysis P600, p. 923 (1988) (""Secondary-line injury arises 
[under the Robinson-Patman Act] when a powerful firm buying supplies at favorable prices thereby gains a decisive advantage 
over its competitors that are forced to pay higher prices for their supplies""). It rarely occurs where, as would be the case here, 
the price-discriminated goods are sold to various businesses for consumption. "

1281,1," The Court states that ""continued enforcement of the national antitrust policy grants the States more freedom, not less, in 
deciding whether to subject discrete parts of the economy to additional regulations and controls,"" ante, at 632. However, in 
Parker, we held that the Sherman Act simply does not apply to conduct regulated by the State. The enforcement of the national 
antitrust policy, as embodied in the antitrust laws, may grant individuals more freedom to compete in our free market system, but 
it does not implicate the freedom of the States in deciding whether to regulate."
1281,2," In 324 Liquor Corp. v. Duffy, 479 U.S. 335, 93 L. Ed. 2d 667, 107 S. Ct. 720 (1987), we held that a New York statute failed to 
shelter private actors from antitrust liability because the state legislation required retailers to charge 112% of the price ""posted"" 
by wholesalers. The New York statute, like the California statute at issue in California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal 
Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 63 L. Ed. 2d 233, 100 S. Ct. 937 (1980), gave no power to the state agency to review or establish 
the reasonableness of the price schedules ""posted"" by the wholesalers. 324 Liquor, supra, at 345. "
1282,3," The state regulatory programs in Midcal, supra, Patrick v. Burget, 486 U.S. 94, 100 L. Ed. 2d 83, 108 S. Ct. 1658 (1988), and 
324 Liquor, supra, would all fail to provide immunity for lack of active supervision under the test adopted by the Court of Appeals."
1282,4," In neither of the examples cited by the majority as instances of state regulation not intended to authorize anticompetitive 
conduct would application of a less detailed active supervision test change the result. In Patrick v. Burget, supra, we concluded 
there was no immunity because the State did not have the authority to review the anticompetitive action undertaken by the peer 
review committee; in Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 579, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141, 96 S. Ct. 3110 (1976), it is unlikely that the 
clear articulation requirement under our current jurisprudence would be met with respect to the market for light bulbs."
1282,5," It is not clear, from the Court's formulation, whether this is a separate test applicable only to negative option regulatory 
schemes, or whether it applies more generally to issues of immunity under the state-action doctrine. "
1295,1," In his brief plaintiff explains the nature of the action as being his attempt to seek damages arising out of the AMA's ""violation of 
the Illinois Anti-Trust Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 38, P 60-1 et. seq., by way of AMA's allegedly far-reaching, dendritic presence 
which side-lines established avenues of societal control ranging from informal peer pressure, to formal peer review, to free-
market enterprise forces, and to the legal system's last-resort overview functions of the healthcare industry. The arrested social 
control over the AMA's conduct is to the detriment of the healthcare environment to which Plaintiff's proximate exposure 
allegedly caused same substantial injury, and continually threatens the demographic group to which Plaintiff was associated, 
and is actionable against as a matter of public policy on anti-trust grounds."" "
1302,1," The Plaintiffs seek to represent all employers (excluding defendants and coconspirators, including any subsidiary or affiliate thereof and excluding those 
employers who were self-insured) doing business in the State of Maine required by Maine law to carry workers' compensation 
insurance coverage between November 20, 1987 and the present date (hereinafter ""the damage period"") [who] purchased 
policies of workers' compensation insurance from one or more of the named defendants including any subsidiary or affiliate 
thereof or from one or more of defendants' co-conspirators, or from any insurance company utilizing the higher rates for workers' 
compensation insurance which resulted from defendants' unlawful conspiracy. Cmplt. P 24(a). By agreement of the parties, consideration of the Plaintiffs' motion for class certification was deferred until after a decision on 
Defendants' motion for summary judgment issued."
1302,2," The Plaintiffs filed a ""First Amended Complaint"" on December 4, 1991, which differs from the original complaint only in that it 
adds The Hartford and its affiliates and subsidiaries as defendants. "
1304,3," Plaintiffs' memoranda of law alluded to, in the text and in footnotes, a number of arguments that were never developed. 
Although Plaintiffs raised none of these arguments at oral argument, the Court will address each briefly. Plaintiffs raised three pro forma objections to Defendants' motion for summary judgment. The Court notes simply that there are 
no issues of ""motive and intent"" in this case because the Defendants have admitted, for purposes of this motion, that they 
conspired to withdraw from Maine; that this Court is not required to make any credibility determinations in deciding this motion; 
and that summary judgment is not an extreme and disfavored procedural device but rather is expressly designed to end cases in 
which the material facts are undisputed and one party is clearly entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Plaintiffs also complained that it is too early in the course of discovery for the Court to consider a summary judgment motion. 
Plaintiffs' Memo at 8 n.5, 14-15. Plaintiffs did not explain how further discovery will improve their likelihood of defeating this 
motion for summary judgment. Additional discovery will be largely directed at gathering evidence regarding the Defendants' 
alleged conspiracy to withdraw from the Maine workers' compensation market. Plaintiffs would have to prove the alleged 
conspiracy if this case proceeded to trial. For purposes of this summary judgment motion, however, Defendants have admitted 
that they conspired. Furthermore, Plaintiffs agreed to the timing for Defendants' dispositive motion at the initial scheduling 
conference held in October 1991 knowing that it could be either a motion to dismiss or a summary judgment motion. "
1305,4," According to Areeda and Turner: Direct legislation is a more effective and more appropriate method of promoting such other objectives. Within any plausible 
bounds of statutory interpretation, antitrust law can at best make only a marginal contribution to them. Moreover, the weighing 
and resolution of conflicting interests and objectives would involve the courts in essentially political decisions for which there are 
no workable legal standards, and would often place them in a regulatory or supervisory role for which they are ill-equipped."

resolution of the motions to dismiss. See Minute Order of 1/08/88. All pending motions were dismissed as moot when the court

1329,5," The district court also found that the defendants, in particular Scheidler, have links with arsonists who have fire-bombed health 
centers. The court also found that the defendants have not condemned fire-bombing. The court made these findings after 
defendant Wojnar moved for Rule 11 sanctions based upon the plaintiffs' allegation of the association in a pleading. See Denial 
of Defendant Wojnar's First Motion for Sanctions, March 27, 1992. "
1331,6,"  We note that the boycott in Missouri V. NOW is readily distinguishable from the defendants' actions in this case. The boycott was 
a peaceful, otherwise lawful attempt to influence legislation. In this case defendants' conduct (trespass, extortion, vandalism, and 
theft) violates state criminal laws. ""The First Amendment does not protect violence. 'Certainly violence has no sanctuary in the 
First Amendment, and the use of weapons, gunpowder, and gasoline may not constitutionally masquerade under the guise of 
advocacy.'"" NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware, Inc., 458 U.S. 886, 916 (1981) (quoting Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U.S. 66, 75 (1970) 
(Douglas, J., concurring)). Moreover, the avowed purpose of the defendants' activities is to close centers, not influence 
government actors. "

Statutes 15 (1978)."

1332,9, James F. Wilson (R. Iowa). Id. at 20.
1332,10, George F. Hoar (R. Massachusetts). Id. at 14. 
1334,11," We also note Professor Fischel's point that ""conduct unprotected by Noerr does not necessarily constitute an antitrust 
violation."" Daniel R. Fischel, Antitrust Liability for Attempts to Influence Government Action: The Basis & Limits of the Noerr-
Pennington Doctrine, 45 U. Chi. L. Rev. 80, 82 (1977)."
1334,12," Allen Bradley involved an illegal combination of a labor union, contractors, and manufacturers. "
1336,13,"  This is not to say that cartels or would-be monopolists who try to injure competitors by raising costs are not subject to the 
antitrust laws. See, e.g., Premier Electric Construction Co. v. National Electrical Contractors Ass'n, 814 F.2d 358, 368 (7th Cir. 
1987) (discussing anticompetitive effects, and thus illegality, of raising rivals' costs). See also 3 Milton Handler, Antitrust in 
Transition 1178-79 (1991)."
1336,14," 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a) provides in relevant part: HN6[
] It shall be unlawful for any person who has received any in come derived, directly or indirectly, from a pattern of 
racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt in which such person has participated as a principal . . . to use or 
invest, directly or indirectly, any part of such income, or the proceeds of such income, in acquisition of any interest in, or the 
establishment or operation of, any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect interstate commerce. "
1337,15," Azurite held that defendants who were able to purchase stock at artificially low prices because of their fraudulent SEC filings 
derived income from the fraud within the meaning of § 1962(a). "
1338,16," § 1962(c) provides: HN8[
] It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which 
affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs 
through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt. "
1342,17," The Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951, which punishes obstruction of interstate commerce through extortionate means, does not 
require that the defendant profit economically from the extortion. See Town of West Hartford v. Operation Rescue, 915 F.2d 92, 
102 (2d Cir. 1990); United States v. Anderson, 716 F.2d 446 (7th Cir. 1983) (defendant kidnapped and threatened to kill 
physician unless he agreed to cease performing abortions violated Act); United States v. Starks, 515 F.2d 112 (3d Cir. 1975) 
(""solicitations"" for religious purposes not exempt from Hobbs Act). "
1360,1," Count I of the complaint alleges violations of federal antitrust law, pursuant to Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1 
and Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 15, 26, respectively. Count II alleges defamation under Pennsylvania 
law. Count III alleges tortious interference with contract and prospective contractual relations under Pennsylvania law. Counts IV 
and V, claiming violations of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951 and the Racketeer Influenced & Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 
U.S.C. §§ 1961 et seq., were dismissed by Order, dated 7/28/89."
1360,2," Bear, Stearns was Lakshmi's clearing agent. Defendant Ross is an employee of the Exchange, holding the position of 
Secretary of the Exchange."
1360,3," Despite plaintiff's contentions to the contrary, the Commission determined that Rule 901 was applicable to the Peterson 
membership bid. The Commission did, however, conclude that the Exchange did not properly apply the rule to the facts of the 
case. Sec. Act Rel. No. 29688, September 13, 1991, at 3-5. "
1361,4," It is well established for purposes of § 1 of the Sherman Act that there can be no conspiracy or concerted action between a 
corporation and its own employees. Tose v. First Pennsylvania Bank, N.A., 648 F.2d 879 (3d Cir.) cert. denied, 451 U.S. 893 
(1981). Thus, plaintiff may not rely solely on an alleged conspiracy by Ross with his employer, the Exchange."
1361,5," Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides a treble damages remedy to ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property 
by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws. 15 U.S.C. § 15. The prerequisite to a colorable claim under the Clayton Act 
is the showing of a cognizable antitrust injury. See Associated General Contractors, Inc. v. California State Council of 
Carpenters, 459 U.S. 535 (1983)."
1361,6," There is no evidence of record to support the claim that defendants' conduct constituted a per se violation of the Sherman Act. 
See, e.g., Monsanto Co., 465 U.S. at 754. "
1362,7," (c) HN7[
] ""The district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim under subsection (a) if-- (3) the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction, . . ."" 28 U.S.C. § 1367 (c)(3)."
1362,8," In a telephone conference also held today, during which I discussed the status of the case with Ms. Epstein; Anthony R. 
Twadorski, counsel for Bear, Stearns & Co.; and Diana Donaldson, counsel for the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and Murray L. 
Ross, esq., I advised the remaining counsel of record that this case must proceed promptly. "
