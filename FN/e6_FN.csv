26,1," The defendants urge this Court, as an alternative to dismissing for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, to certify this question for 
appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). This motion is moot in light of this Court's decision to grant defendants' motion to 
dismiss the complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) (6). "
27,2," Westel also alleges in paragraph 6 of the Second Amended Complaint that ""Defendant AT&T, alone and in concert with the 
predecessor of ATTI, devised a scheme and artifice to defraud and obtain money and property of Westel . . ."" However, Westel 
nowhere explains what it means by the predecessor of ATTI nor by what legal theory a corporation may be held liable for the 
acts of such a ""predecessor."" "
29,3," This section makes one reference to ATTI but only alludes to subsequent paragraphs of the complaint containing the two 
allegations already noted. See Second Amended Complaint at P 21(B)."
29,4," At least some support for such a relaxed approach is nonetheless provided in Luce v. Edelstein, 802 F.2d 49 (2d Cir. 1986), in 
which the Second Circuit held that ""no specific connection between fraudulent representation in [an] Offering Memorandum and 
particular defendants is necessary where, as here, defendants are insiders or affiliates participating in the offer of the securities 
in question."" Id. at 55."
29,5," Westel voluntarily repled after AT&T moved to dismiss Westel's first complaint. The Amended Complaint was then dismissed 
by this Court pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) and 12(b)(6). "

36,5," The Commission sent notice of the public hearing to the Volusia, Seminole, Orange and Osceola County governments. The 
record reflects that no notice was sent to the Brevard County government. At the time of the Commission proceedings, Florida

modification of territorial agreement with Florida Power Corporation relative to service areas, Dkt. No. 74097-EU, Order No.

Agreement's procedure for variances in the territorial boundaries due to exceptional circumstances and changes in municipal 
boundaries. In re: Application of Florida Power Corporation and Florida Power & Light Company for Approval of Amendment of 
Territorial Agreement, Dkt. No. 890403-EU, Order No. 21309 (June 2, 1989). "

39,10," HN5[
] Section 366.04, ""Jurisdiction of the commission"", provides in pertinent part: (2) in the exercise of its jurisdiction, the commission shall have power over electric utilities for the following purposes: (d) To approve territorial agreements between and among rural electric cooperatives, municipal electric utilities, and other 
electric utilities under its jurisdiction. . . (e) To resolve, upon petition of a utility or on its own motion, any territorial dispute involving service areas between and 
among rural electric cooperatives, municipal electric utilities, and other electric utilities under its jurisdiction . . ."
39,*," * * (5) The commission shall further have jurisdiction over the planning, development, and maintenance of a coordinated 
electric power grid throughout Florida to assure an adequate and reliable source of energy for operational and emergency 
purposes in Florida and the avoidance of further uneconomic duplication of generation, transmission, and distribution 
facilities."
39,11," Such harmful effects include ""unsatisfactory customer relations"", ""service inefficiencies,"" and ""the premature erection of more 
lines than are needed for immediate service, which lessens the immediate return of the investment, and, in effect, must be 
subsidized by other customers of the utility."" Order No. 3799 at 4. "
40,12," Plaintiff relies on the Supreme Court's recent decision in FTC v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 504 U.S. 621, 112 S. Ct. 2169, 119 L. Ed. 
2d 410 (1992), to argue that a state must expressly approve the particular anticompetitive act of the party seeking state action 
immunity. In Ticor the Supreme Court stated that ""Midcal's requirement that the State articulate a clear policy shows little more 
than that the State has not acted through inadvertence; it cannot alone ensure, as required by our precedents, that particular 
anticompetitive conduct has been approved by the State."" Given the Supreme Court's previous statements with respect to state 
action immunity, it is not likely that the Court would require a state to give express approval of each anticompetitive act. 
Nonetheless, the Court need not reach this issue for the purposes of this Order, as Florida law does require the Commission to 
expressly approve all anticompetitive territorial agreements among utilities. "

antitrust cases, but requires only that the non-moving party's inferences be reasonable and not ""economically senseless."" 
Eastman Kodak, 112 S. Ct. at 2083."
47,5," Virtual claimed that a jury could find that Prime possessed almost total control over the Prime 50 Series hardware maintenance 
market.  Virtual I, 957 F.2d at 1330. "
48,6," As noted in Virtual I, HN2[
] the elements of a per se tying claim are as follows: ""(1) There must be a tying arrangement 
between two distinct products or services; (2) the seller must have sufficient economic power in the tying market to restrain 
appreciably competition in the tied product market; and (3) the amount of commerce affected must be not insubstantial."" Virtual 
I, 957 F.2d at 1323 (quoting Directory Sales Management Corporation v. Ohio Bell Tel. Co., 833 F.2d 606, 609 (6th Cir. 
1982) (other quotations omitted))."
48,7," We stated: ""An 11% market share, standing alone, is insufficient as a matter of law to confer the 'great market power, 
evidenced by an exceptional demand for the tying product' necessary for a per se illegal tie."" Virtual I, 957 F.2d at 1325 (quoting 
A.I. Root, 806 F.2d at 676). "
49,8," We observed that this court previously had refused to ignore interbrand competition by limiting the product market to one 
manufacturer's product, citing A.I. Root Co. v. Computer/Dynamics, Inc., 806 F.2d 673 (6th Cir. 1986) and Kingsport Motors, 
Inc. v. Chrysler Corp., 644 F.2d 566 (6th Cir. 1991). Both of these cases can be distinguished from the instant one. The 
disposition in A.I. Root turned on the fact that the evidence in the case established that equipment using BOSS software had 
""close substitutes."" 806 F.2d at 676. The relevant market was not BOSS software as a unique product market, but small 
business computers.  Id. at 675-76. Thus, the defendant lacked that ""essential characteristic"" of an illegal tying arrangement, the 
seller's ability to coerce customers into buying an unwanted tied product.  Id. at 677. In fact, the plaintiff in that case, rather than 
submitting to the tie, purchased new IBM equipment and software. Id. at 675. Kingsport Motors, 644 F.2d 566, is likewise distinguishable because there the relevant product market, ""properly analyzed,"" 
was ""all medium priced cars available for sale in the United States."" Id. at 571. So defined, there was simply no proof that the 
seller had any power to raise prices or that the tying arrangement at issue affected any appreciable number of buyers within the 
applicable market. Id. Thus, Kingsport Motors, by focusing on the primary equipment market rather than the aftermarket 
cannot compel a similar result in this case."
49,9," In rejecting Virtual's contention that PDGS constitutes a relevant ""submarket,"" we relied, in part, on the proposition in A.I. Root 
Co. v. Computer/Dynamics, Inc., 806 F.2d 673 (6th Cir. 1986), that ""competitors of [defendant] could produce computer 
hardware and software equivalent to that manufactured by [defendant]. Accordingly, [defendant's product] did not compose a 
separate and distinct submarket within the computer industry as to which we should measure 'market share.'"" Virtual I, 957 F.2d 
at 1327 (quoting A.I. Root, 806 F.2d at 675-76. As previously noted, see supra note 7, A.I. Root rejected the plaintiff's attempts 
to define BOSS as a separate market because although it was copyrighted, there was proof of close substitutes. Id. Closer to 
the mark is a case discussed in A.I. Root, Digidyne Corp. v. Data General, 734 F.2d 1336 (9th Cir. 1984). A.I. Root 
distinguished Digidyne on the basis that the tying product (RDOS), a computer command system, was unique. In contrast, the 
plaintiff in A.I. Root had not presented any evidence that BOSS was particularly unique or desirable. Here, Virtual has offered 
proof of PDGS's desirable-ness; namely, Ford's requirement that all the design companies with which it does business use the 
software and software updates. "
50,10," This view is not inconsistent with dicta in International Logistics, 884 F.2d at 909. There, we stated that Chrysler products 
could not be a relevant market ""absent a government imposed distinctions between Chrysler manufactured replacement parts 
and Chrysler compatible replacement parts . . . ."" Id. By implication, had such a government imposed distinction existed, it may 
have had the ""unique characteristics that would support its consideration as a separate geographic market."" Id. In this case, the 
""imposed distinction"" is Ford's requirement that its automotive design suppliers use the most current version of PDGS marketed 
exclusively through Prime. "
57,1," The exact relationship and role of the four Defendants is unclear. Cargill Inc. has responded on behalf of itself and ""its 
unincorporated divisions."" Motion to Dismiss (Docket No. 4) P 1. It appears that these unincorporated divisions include Northeast 
Petroleum Division of Cargill, Inc. It is not clear whether Northeast Petroleum Division of Maine, Inc. and Northeast Petroleum 
Division of Cape Cod exist at all, are unincorporated divisions of Cargill, or are Massachusetts corporations as alleged in the 
Complaint. Docket No. 1 PP 7-8. For purposes of this motion to dismiss, the identity and relationship of the Defendants are not 
critical."
57,2," Plaintiff Ashmore refused to implement this pricing policy at any time; Plaintiffs Boya, Simone, and Simeone refused at first but 
ultimately were compelled to implement the pricing policy."
57,3," The issue of whether Plaintiffs have antitrust standing is not an issue of standing in the constitutional sense. Defendants do not 
argue that Plaintiffs do not allege a case or controversy sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article III of the Constitution. 
Rather, their standing argument merely alleges that Plaintiffs are not proper parties to bring this antitrust action. See Associated 
General Contractors, Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 535 n.31, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 103 S. Ct. 897 
(1977). "
58,4," Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides in relevant part: HN2[
] Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws 
may sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found . . . 
without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of 
suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."
58,15, U.S.C.S. § 15(a).
58,5," For purposes of this challenge to standing, the Court will assume, without deciding, that Plaintiffs could prove that the alleged 
discriminatory pricing system violates the Robinson-Patman Act which prohibits discrimination in prices under certain 
circumstances. In relevant part, the Act provides that: HN3[
] It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or 
indirectly, to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any 
of the purchasers involved in such discrimination are in commerce, . . . and where the effect of such discrimination may be 
substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent 
competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of 
either of them . . . ."
58,15," U.S.C.S. § 13(a). Also relevant to the arguments before the Court is 15 U.S.C.S. § 13a, which provides criminal penalties For 
participation in discriminatory sales. HN4[
] It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, to be a party to, or 
assist in, any transaction of sale, or contract to sell, which discriminates to his knowledge against competitors of the 
purchaser . . . . "
59,," Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $ 5,000 or 
imprisoned not more than one year, or both."
59,6," Northeast makes much of the fact that no court has granted standing under section 4 based on a violation of the Robinson-
Patman Act. However, the analysis required by the Supreme Court to determine whether a plaintiff has standing under section 4 
of the Clayton Act does not depend upon whether the underlying violation is of the Sherman Act or of the Robinson-Patman Act. 
(see discussion of Associated General, infra). Therefore, the Court is not constrained to consider only those cases based on 
Robinson-Patman violations."
59,7," In this case, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit adhered to its prior decision in Ostrofe v. H. S. Crocker Co., 670 F.2d 
1378 (9th Cir. 1982), vacated, 460 U.S. 1007 (1983). The earlier decision will be referred to as ""Ostrofe I"" and the decision on 
remand as ""Ostrofe II""."
59,8," There is contrary authority at the district court level in the Third Circuit. See Shaw v. Russell Trucking Line, Inc., 542 F. Supp. 
776 (W.D. Pa. 1982). However, the decision in Gregory Marketing Corp. v. Wakefern Food Corp., 787 F.2d 92 (3d Cir. 1986), 
denying standing to a broker who alleged retaliatory discharge for refusal to violate the Robinson-Patman Act, suggests, without 
deciding, that the Third Circuit would deny standing to an employee claiming retaliatory discharge for refusal to violate the 
antitrust laws."
59,9," However, Fallis requires a case-by-case standing analysis, and does not appear to stand for the proposition that no employee 
may recover on a theory of retaliatory discharge. See Helder v. Hitachi Power Tools, U.S.A. Ltd., 1992-2 U.S. Trade Cas. (CCH) 
P69,930 (W.D. Mich. 1992) (denying a motion for judgment on the pleadings in a retaliatory discharge case). "
60,10," When Congress originally enacted the Sherman Act, there was no provision for treble recovery. The amendment providing for 
treble damages was enacted in 1914 to encourage private enforcement of the antitrust law. By 1914, when section 4 of the 
Clayton Act was enacted, courts were already applying traditional notions of proximate cause to circumscribe liability under the 
Act. See Associated General, 459 U.S. at 534 (citing Loeb v. Eastman Kodak Co, 183 F. 704 (3d Cir. 1910) (in which a 
stockholder of a corporation injured by an antitrust violation was not entitled to recover treble damages because the injury was 
""indirect, remote, and consequential"")). Therefore, when Congress enacted section 4 of the Clayton Act in 1914, it ""presumably 
also [adopted] the judicial gloss."" Id."
60,11," Defendants argue that the ""target area"" test for antitrust standing, which the First Circuit followed before Associated General, 
bars Plaintiffs' claim. See Engine Specialties, Inc. v. Bombardier, Ltd., 605 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 983, 64 
L. Ed. 2d 839, 100 S. Ct. 2964 (1980). The ""target area"" test permits standing only for those in the market towards which an 
anticompetitive activity is directed. In Associated General, however, the Supreme Court rejected the ""target area"" test in favor of 
the standing analysis set out in the text below. Associated General, 459 U.S. at 536, n.33. Associated General requires a 
broader inquiry and a balancing of concerns which is not satisfied by the ""target area"" test. See Southaven Land Co. v. Malone 
& Hyde, Inc., 715 F.2d 1079, 1086 (6th Cir. 1983) (""implementing the Supreme Court's directive to consider the § 4 inquiry on a 
case by case basis by applying the criteria mandated by Associated General""). "
61,12," For a general discussion of the various approaches to standing analysis in the wake of Associated General, see Robert M. 
Taylor, Antitrust Developments: Antitrust Standing: Its Growing -- or More Accurately Shrinking -- Dimensions, 55 Antitrust L.J. 
515 (1986). For a discussion of the application of Associated General to the case of discharged employees, see, e.g., Gary M. 
Shaw, Retaliatorily Discharged Employees' Standing to Sue Under the Antitrust Laws, 67 Or. L. Rev. 331 (1988); Matthew H. 
Lynch, Note, Antitrust Standing After Associated General Contractors: The Issue of Employee Retaliatory Discharge, 63 B.U. L. 
Rev. 983 (1983). "
62,13," The Court noted that this task was further complicated by the variety of forms in which the cost of the anticompetitive violation 
might be absorbed in Associate General These costs may have taken the form of reduced profits, reduced wages, reduced 
workforce, reduced hours, and lost union dues at various levels in the chain. Associated General 459 U.S. at 544."
62,14," The delay that can be expected before such disadvantaged purchasers become aware of the anticompetitive effects of an 
antitrust violation is not without costs. Although treble damages may provide a remedy for injured individuals, once competition 
has been reduced, damages alone cannot restore it. Furthermore, under the rule of Illinois Brick, consumers of petroleum "
63,," products are unlikely to have any remedy for their injury in this case. Any damage to consumers would be derivative of the injury 
to the purchasers of petroleum goods for resale who are allegedly the first line of victims or this price discrimination scheme."
63,15," This Court notes that, in light of the difficulty in detecting antitrust violations, providing standing to employees who are coerced 
to violate the antitrust laws is more likely to provide efficient enforcement than denying standing. In reaching this conclusion, the 
Court has rejected the Seventh Circuit's economic analysis as unconvincing. See Bichan v. Chemetron Corp., 681 F.2d 514, 520 
(7th Cir. 1982). The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit's approach to ""efficient enforcement"" balances the conflicting 
interest of enforcement of the antitrust laws with ""the avoidance of excessive treble damages litigation"" and concludes that only 
consumers and competitors should have standing because ""it is this select class of plaintiffs that can impose the deterrent sting 
of treble damages at the smallest cost of enforcement."" Id. This conclusion rests on the unrealistic assumption that consumers 
and competitors will discover antitrust violations. Moreover, it fails to consider the efficiency of the deterrent effect that employee 
standing will have in preventing antitrust violations. Finally, no consideration is given to the fact that an employee who complies 
with coercion to avoid discharge will himself be guilty of criminally violating the antitrust laws or that such cooperation both 
increases the number of antitrust violations and the cost to consumers, competitors, and the legal system when antitrust 
schemes are eventually discovered. "
64,16," Defendants argue that McCready has no application in the present case because McCready was a consumer in the market 
for psychotherapy treatment. Reply Brief in Support of Motion to Dismiss (Docket No. 12) at 1. However, they ignore the central 
thrust of McCready which rejects artificial constraints on section 4, refusing to limit its protection ""to consumers, or to purchasers, 
or to competitors, or to sellers."" Id. at 472. The central problem raised by McCready's claim was that her injury was not the result of any anticompetitive effect of the 
conspiracy. As Justice Rehnquist noted in his dissenting opinion, McCready ""alleges that Blue Shield's policy violates the 
antitrust laws only by virtue of its anticompetitive effect on psychologists. She does not allege that Blue Shield's policy is illegal in 
any way because of its effect on subscribers."" Id. at 491. The issue which split the Court was whether injury which was caused 
by the attempted use of McCready as an instrument to carry out an antitrust violation was ""antitrust injury."" "
65,17," Nevertheless the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit denied standing in Fallis, holding that the plaintiff sales representative's 
injury was not direct.  Fallis, 866 F.2d at 212. In so doing, they revert to the ""target test"" and conclude that the injury to the sales 
representative is indirect because it is a ""byproduct"" of the antitrust violation. Id. at 211. This reasoning improperly introduces the 
element of intent into the directness inquiry. See McCready, 457 U.S. at 479 (concluding that the fact that the goal of the 
conspiracy was to injure psychologists did not make the subscriber's injury ""remote""). There is no doubt that the injury alleged in 
this case is the direct and immediate result of steps taken in furtherance of the antitrust violation. There are no intermediate 
victims; no danger of duplicative damages; and nothing speculative about the injury to a discharged employee. The fact that the 
injury is not the primary goal of the violation does not render the injury indirect."
65,18," One concern of these courts is that the damages claimed by a victim of wrongful discharge are ""unrelated"" to the 
anticompetitive effect of a violation. These costs, though they may be unrelated to the anticompetitive effects in a mathematical 
sense, are incurred by the intentional acts of an employer to carry out an anticompetitive scheme. The cost to a discharged "
66,," employee are much like those injuries incurred in McCready. The amount of the reimbursement refused to McCready had no 
relationship to the anticompetitive effects on the market for psychotherapy. Rather, this amount related to the type and cost of 
treatment that McCready received. Nevertheless, there was no surprise or injustice to Blue Shield, who knowingly refused 
McCready a fixed amount in furtherance of its anticompetitive conspiracy. The injuries which are deliberately inflicted in an 
attempt to coerce third parties to participate in an anticompetitive scheme should be part of the calculus that encourage would-
be antitrust violators to shrink from pursuing illegal schemes."
66,19," The reasoning in all these cases is scant. They rely on Brunswick and interpret it as limiting section 4 claims to injury caused 
by the anticompetitive effects of antitrust violations. The cases ignore the fact that Brunswick dealt with injuries caused by 
increased competition. They also overlook the essential Brunswick holding that the purpose of the antitrust laws is to protect 
""competition, not competitors."" Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 488. In the retaliatory discharge context, refusing standing to employees 
for no other reason than that they are not competitors seems to read this statement backwards."
66,20," Indeed, even the discussion about whether the Union had alleged ""antitrust injury"" within the meaning of Brunswick was 
unnecessary according to Defendants. Under Defendants' approach, the first sentence of this discussion was dispositive insofar 
as it pointed out that the Union was neither a consumer nor a competitor in the relevant market. Nevertheless, the Associated 
General court went on to observe that labor enjoys a broad exemption from antitrust laws, is protected by another body of 
federal law, and is generally not served by increased competition. Associated General, 459 U.S. at 539-40. All these 
considerations apparently went into the determination that the Union had not alleged ""antitrust injury Id."
66,21," Brunswick is not to the contrary; there, not only did the Supreme Court hold that the plaintiffs in that case had not alleged 
antitrust injury, but they found that the ""injury"" which had been alleged was ""inimical"" to the purposes of the antitrust laws. The 
Bichan conclusion that Congress was not concerned with employee coercion or discharge, even if correct, does not 
automatically lead to the conclusion that injury related to such coercion is ""inimical"" to the purposes of the antitrust laws. "
67,22," The trend has been to recognize a cause of action for wrongful discharge; however, as of 1992, nine of the forty-seven states 
that had ruled on this issue did not provide a remedy for employees discharged for refusing to violate the law. See Martin 
Marietta Corp. v. Lorenz, 823 P.2d 100, 106 n.4 (Colo. 1992) (adopting a cause of action based on wrongful discharge in 
violation of public policy and reviewing the holdings of other state courts). See generally, 82 Am. Jur. 2d § 47. Maine is one of 
the few states that have not yet ruled on this issue. HN10[
] Maine law provides a limited statutory cause of action which 
protects employees who refuse to implement an employer's unlawful practice only when such practice would create a danger of 
serious injury or death. 26 M.R.S.A. § 833. However, the Maine courts have not yet ruled on whether Maine common law will 
permit a cause of action to be established for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. "
68,23," Although Plaintiffs allege jurisdiction based on diversity as well as federal question, the Complaint indicates that at least one 
Plaintiff (Richard Simeone) and several Defendants are citizens of Massachusetts for diversity purposes. Complaint PP 5, 7, 8. 
Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.A. § 1332 requires complete diversity between plaintiffs and defendants. Therefore, on its face, the 
Complaint does not provide a basis for subject matter jurisdiction on diversity grounds."
68,24," The written promise which Plaintiff alleges as the basis for the breach of contract and promissory estoppel claims was 
generated by Cargill, Inc.'s principle office in Minnesota for distribution to offices of Cargill throughout the United States and, 
possibly, the world. Affidavit of M.A. Kurschner (Docket No. 12, Exhibit 2) P 6. "
69,25," Even if the policy decisions were generated in Minnesota, neither negotiation nor performance ties this contract to Minnesota. "
74,1," These two related corporations are both in the food distribution business. According to answers to interrogatories, R.W. does 
marketing for mainland corporations and accounting for De la Cruz, Inc.. De la Cruz, in turn, distributes but does not purchase 
products from producers. It makes purchases from Impex Trading, another related company. See District Court opinion at 5 n.2. 
For convenience, we refer to these companies jointly as either ""plaintiffs"" or ""R.W."". "
76,2," The provision states in full: HN4[
] Notwithstanding the existence in a dealer's contract of a clause reserving to the parties the unilateral right to 
terminate the existing relationship, no principal or grantor may directly or indirectly perform any act detrimental to the 
established relationship or refuse to renew said contract on its normal expiration, except for just cause."
76,3," This provision defines a ""dealer"" as a ""person actually interested in a dealer's contract because of his having effectively in his 
charge in Puerto Rico the distribution, agency, concession or representation of a given merchandise or service."" "
79,4," Medina & Medina is not precisely on point because it involved a supplier's decision to totally withdraw from the Puerto Rico 
market following good-faith negotiations that failed to achieve agreement between the parties. There is no indication here that 
Welch intended to leave the market rather than find a new dealer. Nevertheless, we believe the principle underlying Medina & 
Medina is equally applicable in these circumstances, i.e., that a supplier has just cause to terminate if it has bargained in good 
faith but has not been able ""to reach an agreement as to price, credit, or some other essential element of the dealership,"" 858 
F.2d at 824. This would be true at least where, as here, the supplier's market in Puerto Rico was well established before the 
current dealer relationship and the supplier's action therefore ""is not aimed at reaping the good will or clientele established by 
the dealer,"" id."
79,5," The dealership contract between Medina & Medina and Country Pride contained no time limit. Product prices were set 
periodically by mutual agreement.  858 F.2d at 818. "
80,6," We recognize that Welch conceded that R.W. was performing as a dealer only for purposes of its summary judgment motion, 
and that, consequently, this issue also may surface again on remand. "
81,7," Section 1 HN7[
] makes unlawful ""every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations . . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 1."
81,8," Section 2 HN8[
] makes it an offense for any person to ""monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with 
any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations 
. . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 2. "
82,9," We have not considered Magna's argument that the § 1 claim fails because the requirement for joint action by independent 
entities is not fulfilled here in light of Magna's and Welch's unified economic interest. The argument does seem to have some 
force, however. See Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 776 (holding that ""the coordinated behavior of a parent and its wholly owned 
subsidiary falls outside the reach of [§ 1]""); Pink Supply Corp. v. Hiebert, Inc., 788 F.2d 1313, 1316-17 (8th Cir. 1986) (corporate 
agents may lack ""the independent economic consciousness"" necessary to be conspirators separate from their principal). "
83,10," For example, plaintiffs could have done a sampling of stores to compare prices and shelf life between the Welch and Donald 
Duck products. If bottles of Donald Duck juice remained on the shelves for long periods while Welch products enjoyed a quick 
turnover, and Welch's prices were substantially lower, plaintiffs may have been able to persuade the district court to grant 
discovery into the possibility that Welch was engaged in predatory pricing. See Brook Group, 113 S. Ct. at 2587 (predatory 
pricing involves pricing products ""in an unfair manner with an object to eliminate or retard competition and thereby gain and 
exercise control over prices in the relevant market""). "
86,1," Judge Norgle adopted the July 31, 1990 Report and Recommendation (""R & R"") of this court which concluded that defendants 
were entitled to summary judgment."
86,2," In their reply memorandum on this motion, Mr. King asserts that plaintiffs' counsel is also liable to pay attorneys' fees pursuant 
to 28 U.S.C. § 1927. This contention was not previously raised and cannot be considered at this late date."
86,3," Rule 11 was amended December 1, 1993. "
87,4," Stamatakis' amended complaint included an additional claim, which was subsequently dropped, alleging an attempt by the 
defendants to monopolize the market in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2. "
88,5," In fact, in their objections to Magistrate Judge Balog's Report and Recommendation, plaintiffs stated that their ""antitrust claims 
involve a horizontal group boycott engineered by Premier's non-aligned competitors in order to drive Premier out of business."" 
Objections and Exceptions at 3. They went on to say that Beatrice ""induced the group of Premier's biggest customers to boycott 
Premier."" Id. No evidence was ever submitted that anyone took any business away from Premier, or attempted to do so, apart 
from one client, JWT. While these statements were not made in a memorandum signed by either Mr. Stiefel or Mr. Gross, they 
formed at least part of the basis upon which Judge Norgle denied the motion to dismiss. "
93,*," Honorable Donald P. Lay, Senior Circuit Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation. "
94,1," Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 (1984). In Jefferson Parish, an 
anesthesiologist was denied admission to the defendant hospital's medical staff because the hospital had entered into an 
exclusive contract with a firm of anesthesiologists requiring that all anesthesiology services for the hospital's patients be 
performed by the contracting firm.  Id. at 7. The rejected doctor sued under § 1 of the Sherman Act on the grounds that the users 
of the hospital's operating rooms were compelled to purchase the hospital's anesthesiology services, and that as such, an illegal 
""tying arrangement"" existed.  Id. at 4-5. The court of appeals agreed, finding the contract to be a per se violation of the Sherman 
Act. Id. at 8. The Supreme Court reversed and held that even though the patients were required to purchase two services that 
would otherwise be purchased separately, there was no illegal tying arrangement or violation of the Sherman Act because there 
was no restraint on competition.  Id. at 32. Justice Stevens concluded for the Court that ""without a showing of actual adverse 
effect on competition"" there could be no case under the antitrust laws. Id. at 31."
94,2," Summit Health, Ltd. v. Pinhas, 500 U.S. 322, 114 L. Ed. 2d 366, 111 S. Ct. 1842 (1991). The plaintiff in Summit Health, an 
ophthalmologist, asserted that the defendant hospital and its medical staff had violated § 1 of the Sherman Act by conspiring to 
drive him out of business in order to increase their competitive market share.  111 S. Ct. at 1844. The plaintiff alleged that the 
conspirators used sham professional peer-review proceedings to terminate his privileges and that they took other measures to 
prevent him from obtaining work elsewhere. Id. at 1845-46. The Court held that the claim satisfied the interstate commerce 
requirement of federal antitrust jurisdiction, and its analysis indicated that the offense charged would violate the Sherman Act. Id. 
at 1848-49."
94,3," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides, in pertinent part, that HN1[
] ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or 
otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be 
illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1 (1988 & Supp. IV 1992)."
94,4," Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides that HN2[
] ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of 
anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefore . . . and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the 
cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."" 15 U.S.C. § 15 (1988). Section 16 in part allows HN3[
] ""any person, firm, 
corporation, or association . . . to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of the United States having jurisdiction over the 
parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws."" 15 U.S.C. § 26 (1988)."
94,5," Defendants include Cortland Memorial Hospital, Inc.; the C.M.H. Group, Inc., the Hospital's corporate parent; Robert M. Lovell, 
the hospital administrator and its chief executive officer; and members of the Hospital's Board of Trustees. Dr. Delf King, head of 
the King group, was named as a co-conspirator but not as a defendant to this action."
94,6," The Honorable Frederick J. Scullin, Jr., United States District Judge for the Northern District of New York. "
95,7," The parties dispute the reasons for this decision. Dr. Balaklaw contends that he had become ""the target of an economic 
vendetta"" at CMH because of ""years of independent, reform-minded patient advocacy."" Defendants claim that the Board of 
Trustees was motivated by ""many complaints about inadequate anesthesia services from members of its Medical Staff."""
95,8," In addition, the district court found no actionable conspiracy between the hospital and members of its medical staff because 
they constituted a single entity for purposes of antitrust litigation. The court likewise rejected a conspiracy theory based simply 
on the fact that Dr. King and his group had entered into a contract with the hospital. The court further found there was no 
unreasonable restraint of trade or per se violation of the Sherman Act. In this regard, the court found that the relevant market 
area for anesthesiologist services was nationwide. The court found no evidence that the contract foreclosed competition within 
this market. "
96,9," The Court in Cargill pointed out that even an antitrust injury, while necessary to establish standing under section 4 of the 
Clayton Act, may not always be sufficient to confer standing, ""because a party may have suffered antitrust injury but may not be 
a proper plaintiff under § 4 for other reasons."" 479 U.S. at 110 n.5. In Associated General, the Court discussed some of the 
""other reasons"" that might affect whether a party has antitrust standing. See 459 U.S. at 537-45. The Court mentioned: (1) the 
causal connection between the alleged antitrust violation and the harm to the plaintiff; (2) the existence of an improper motive; 
(3) whether the injury was of a type that Congress sought to redress with the antitrust laws; (4) the directness of the connection 
between the injury and alleged restraint in the relevant market; (5) the speculative nature of the damages; and (6) the risk of 
duplicative recoveries or complex apportionment of damages. Id.; see South Dakota v. Kansas City Indus., 880 F.2d 40, 45-46 
(8th Cir. 1989) (analyzing and applying these factors), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1023, 107 L. Ed. 2d 745, 110 S. Ct. 726 (1990). Over time, courts have developed HN6[
] a two-pronged analysis to determine whether a plaintiff has antitrust standing. As a 
necessary first step, courts must determine whether the plaintiff suffered an antitrust injury. If the answer to that question is yes, 
they must then determine whether any of the other factors, largely relating to the directness and identifiability of the plaintiff's 
injury, prevent the plaintiff from being an efficient enforcer of the antitrust laws. See Todorov, 921 F.2d at 1449. In this appeal, 
since we conclude that Dr. Balaklaw has not suffered an antitrust injury, we do not reach this second question. "
97,10," In Coffey, as here, the plaintiff group of physicians once had an exclusive, though not always written, arrangement with a 
hospital to provide, in that case, radiological services, but was replaced when the hospital entered into an exclusive contract with 
another group.  955 F.2d at 1390. The court affirmed summary judgment granted against the plaintiffs.  Id. at 1395."
97,11," The evidence also suggests that prior to CMH's entering into the contract with Dr. King, Dr. Balaklaw strongly supported the 
""single group"" concept. He spoke at meetings and wrote three separate memoranda to the Board of Trustees endorsing the view 
that the Hospital should have only one anesthesia group providing anesthesia services to patients. On appeal, he argues that he 
never advocated an exclusive contract; rather, ""what he advocated was administration of the department by a single group--with 
no express restriction on membership."" We find this a distinction without a difference. Whether ""administered"" by a single group 
or contractually delegated to a single group, the department would not be freely open to non-group members or other, competing 
groups. Additional doubt is cast on Dr. Balaklaw's willingness to operate the department ""with no restrictions on membership"" by 
the fact that, as he testified at his deposition, he actively enforced non-competition clauses in the employment contracts of Dr. 
Abbassi and Dr. Jeffrey, former members of Dr. Balaklaw's group, to prevent them from practicing at CMH. Joint App. at A-213 - 
A-214. "
98,12," Although this analysis parallels the district court's substantive discussion of the relevant market area, it also is relevant to the 
failure of the plaintiff to demonstrate a cognizable antitrust injury showing an actual adverse effect on competition. See Jefferson 
Parish, 466 U.S. at 31 (noting after analysis of relevant market that ""without a showing of actual adverse effect on competition, 
respondent cannot make out a case under the antitrust laws, and no such showing has been made"")."
98,13," Dr. Balaklaw also alleges that there is no ""pro-competitive justification"" for the exclusive contract with Dr. King. While such 
considerations are more relevant to a ""rule of reason"" analysis on the merits, we note that in addition to the generally pro-
competitive effects short-term exclusive contracts for medical services may have, the defendants here did provide ""evidence of 
the pro-competitive 'redeeming virtues' of their combination."" See Capital Imaging v. Mohawk Valley Medical Assocs., 996 F.2d 
537, 543 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 126 L. Ed. 2d 337, 114 S. Ct. 388 (1993) (citation omitted). The evidence shows that the ad hoc 
advisory committee chose to recommend an exclusive contract with Dr. King's group because his ""proposal was most 
responsive to the needs of our Hospital as identified through the request for proposals."" Joint App. at A-445. The committee's 
report details how Dr. King's proposal was most responsive, particularly in the staffing and financing areas. Id. Under such 
circumstances, the contract appears to best meet the needs of the purchaser, the hospital, and by extension its patients, and 
therefore it is clearly justified on pro-competitiveness grounds. "
99,14," The so-called HN12[
] ""per se violations"" of the Sherman Act include that ""limited class of cases where a defendant's actions 
are so plainly harmful to competition and so obviously lacking in any redeeming pro-competitive values that they are 
'conclusively presumed illegal without further examination.'"" Capital Imaging, 996 F.2d at 542 (citation omitted) (quoting 
Broadcast Music, Inc. v. CBS, 441 U.S. 1, 8, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1, 99 S. Ct. 1551 (1979))."
99,15," We recognize, though, that even though Dr. Balaklaw was reappointed to the Medical Staff in December, 1991, and his 
membership was subject to renewal in December, 1993, as a result of the contract with the King group, Dr. Balaklaw may not 
now actually practice at CMH."
99,16," The peer-review proceedings at issue in Summit Health were those contained in the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 
1986, 42 U.S.C. §§ 11101-11152 (1988), which HN13[
] limits the term ""professional review action"" to actions ""based on the competence or professional conduct of an individual physician,"" id. § 11151(9). Here, there were no charges against Dr. 
Balaklaw relating to his professional competence or conduct. The hearing at which Dr. Balaklaw appealed the Board's decision 
to enter into the contract with Dr. King was authorized by the Hospital's by-laws as an internal grievance procedure for any 
decision that affected a member of the medical staff's clinical privileges. Such proceedings are not ""professional review actions"" 
under the terms of the Health Care Quality Improvement Act. "
100,17," Dr. Balaklaw alleges that, like the plaintiff in Summit Health, he was displaced by the Hospital for retaliatory reasons. Even if it 
is true, as he alleges, that the Hospital was motivated by an ""economic vendetta"" against him, absent ""proof of harm to the 
whole market,"" Capital Imaging, 996 F.2d at 543, that is not properly the subject of an antitrust action. ""Were the law construed 
otherwise, routine disputes between business competitors would be elevated to the status of an antitrust action, thereby 
trivializing the Act because of its too ready availability."" Id. Indeed, were we to characterize the harm to Dr. Balaklaw as an 
""antitrust injury,"" conceivably every competitor who ever lost a contract through a competitive bidding process could come to 
court claiming violations of the Sherman Act. Even if their claims proved meritless, the drawn-out proceedings necessary to 
evaluate them could chill competitive market forces, a prospect directly at odds with the purposes for which the antitrust laws 
were enacted. See id. at 541 (noting that summary judgment is a vital tool in the antitrust area to prevent wasteful trials that may 
chill competitive market forces) (citing Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585-88, 89 L. Ed. 2d 
538, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986)). "
111,1," Plaintiffs seek treble damages for violations of § 2 of the Sherman Act and Florida Antitrust Act of 1980, Fla. Stat. § 542.19 
(1987), treble damages for violations of the Florida RICO laws, and treble damages for violations of Fla. Stat. § 817.061. "
112,2," HN1[
] Rule 56(f) provides that: Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that the party cannot for reasons stated present by 
affidavit facts essential to justify the party's opposition, the court may refuse the application for judgment or may order a 
continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or make such other order 
as is just. Fed.R.Civ.Pro. 56(f) (emphasis added). "
113,3," HN3[

115,5," Professor Ross also took steps to ensure the accuracy of the Spanish translation. He had Marcy Mendoza of Princeton 
Research and Consulting Center (""PRCC""), a native speaker of Spanish, prepare a Spanish translation of the questionnaire. In 
order to ensure the accuracy of Ms. Mendoza's translation, he then had another native speaker prepare a second translation 
independently. "

117,10," If, for instance, there is only a 10% chance that a customer's inside wires will fail in a given year, and the failure will likely 
require no more than one hour to repair, then the probable expense of failure absent IWMS is .10 x $ 87.00; or $ 8.70. At current 
rates, however, the customer will pay as much as $ 2.50 per month, or $ 30.00 per year, for IWMS. Under this hypothetical, 
purchase of the service would thus not make economic sense. "

120,18, See Attachment 2 to Affidavit of Professor Steven Salop. 
122,19," Moreover, as the Court explained in Marine Bancorporation, actual entry into the market, and the intent to do so, are 
irrelevant since the threat of entry, rather than entry itself, constitutes the primary procompetitive effect associated with such 
potential competitors. 418 U.S. at 624. Evidence concerning the potential competitors' capacity to enter the market is far more 
important than evidence concerning the competitors' intent to do so. "
123,20," ""Classical"" market entry barriers include, for example, high start-up costs."
123,21," See Deposition of Dave Graveline (""Graveline""); Deposition of Don Van Ver Laan (""Van Der Laan""); Deposition of M. Ford 
Pollard (""Pollard""); Deposition of Herbert Morris (""Morris""); Deposition of Bruce F. Williams (""Williams""); Deposition of Herbert 
Bornack (""Bornack""); Deposition of Valentine Sellati, Sr. (""Sellati""); Deposition of Steve Alpert (""Alpert""); Deposition of David 
Joseph Hansen (""Hansen""); Deposition of Barbara Guncheon (""Guncheon"")."
123,22," See Graveline at 71, 72, 74, 138; Van Der Laan at 80, 124; Morris at 107, 118; Bornack at 131, 134, 140, 143; Alpert at 76, 
81, 83; Hansen at 64, 65; Guncheon at 166, 169."
123,23," For example, while several competitors testified that advertising costs were prohibitive, only two of the competitors testified 
that the extra advertising costs imposed by the need to overcome the misperceptions created by Southern Bell prevented them 
from entering the market. See Graveline at 70-72, 139-144; Guncheon at 84-88, 169-170. The competitors thus generally failed 
to distinguish between corrective and competitive advertising. This distinction is critical to Plaintiffs' case. The fact that potential competitors must invest in advertising, and are deterred from 
entry by the cost of that advertising, causes no antitrust injury except to the extent that Southern Bell's anticompetitive conduct 
created the need for such advertising. See, e.g., Olympia Equipment Leasing Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 797 F.2d 
370, 377 (7th Cir. 1986) (""Brand-new firms are expected to make their own way in the market, by advertising or other means of 
promotion.""). Thus, the competitors' failure to identify the extra expense imposed by the need to overcome the misunderstanding 
created by Southern Bell severely undercuts the probative value of their testimony. Moreover, none of the competitors attempted to estimate the cost of advertising in the inside wire repair market by extrapolating 
from costs associated with advertising in other markets. Nor did any of the competitors attempt to project advertising costs 
based on their past experience with prospective inside wire customers. In fact, the competitors generally had no information in 
the form of documents, reports, or market studies or analysis to support their claims concerning advertising costs. Further, not a single competitor identified any ""free rider"" problems associated with corrective advertising. Free rider problems 
arise when a competitor's advertising redounds to the benefit of another competitor. "
124,," Finally, Plaintiffs produced no other direct evidence. For example, they did not present a study designed to measure what the 
cost of corrective advertising would likely have been for a typical potential competitor."
124,24," The Court has considered the designated competitors as lay witnesses who may give testimony in the form of opinions or 
inferences under Rule 701 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. HN16[
] Rule 701 provides that: If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness' testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those 
opinions or inferences which are (a) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (b) helpful to a clear 
understanding of the witness' testimony or the determination of a fact in issue. "
125,25," Count V alleges a violation of section 772.103(1). Count VI alleges a violation of section 772.103(2). Counts VII and VIII 
allege violations of sections 772.103(3). "

134,35, Id. 
135,36," As noted, Counts I-IX contain Plaintiffs' antitrust claims, while Counts V-XII contain Plaintiffs' other state law claims. "
136,37," Florida RICO provides civil remedies for criminal violations. Thus, proof of the predicate acts requires proof that the defendant 
engaged in a criminal violation. As a result, Plaintiffs need not prove reliance and damages in order to complete proof of the 
alleged predicate acts. Once Plaintiffs have completed proof of these acts, Plaintiffs must prove reliance and damages in order 
to recover under section 772.104. "
137,38," Southern Bell also raises its Seventh Amendment argument in connection with Counts X-XII. The Court rejects the argument 
in connection with each of those counts for the reasons specified in the preceding section."
137,39," The Court notes that, consistent with the language of the Restatement, Florida does not require a showing of fraud in order to 
recover under a restitution theory. Circle Finance Co. v. Peacock, 399 So. 2d 81, 84 (Fla. 1st Dist. Ct. App. 1981). Instead, 
the plaintiffs need only show that the misrepresentation or omission at issue was material. Moreover, once the plaintiff has 
proved this, the plaintiff is entitled to a presumption of reliance. Sollenbarger, 121 F.R.D. at 434. This presumption arises in the 
case of both omissions and misrepresentations. See Williston # 2 (""Where representations have been made in regard to a 
material matter and action has been taken, in the absence of evidence showing the contrary, it will be presumed that the 
representations were relied on."") (emphasis added). "
139,40, The Court will not entertain any further claims by any party.
139,41," That motion has now been resolved and Southern Bell is obligated to file its answer to those claims in accordance with the 
time frame set out in Rule 12. "
152,1," Although unincorporated, the Appraiser Coalition is entitled to sue in its own name under 735 ILCS 5/2-209.1 (Smith-Hurd 
1993) which permits ""any organization of 2 or more individuals formed for a common purpose, excluding a partnership or 
corporation"" to sue and be sued. "
153,2," The Second Amended Complaint states the following with respect to the alleged arbitrary, onerous, and subjective criteria: (a) Defendants instituted a requirement that any SRPA wishing to become a MAI must take and pass a day-long 
Comprehensive Examination, even though as many as 700 current MAIs have never taken that examination; "
154,," (b) Defendants provided in the Plan, and have rigidly enforced, a requirement that SRPAs wishing to become MAIs must 
demonstrate an additional year of ""experience"" beyond that which was required to earn the SRPA designation, even though 
the SRPA designation itself required more non-residential appraisal experience than was required to become a MAI; (c) Defendants instituted a requirement that SRPAs wishing to become MAIs must pass a ""character and fitness review"" at 
the hands of their MAI competitors, even though prior to the ""unification"" SRPAs demonstrably were required to adhere to a 
stricter standard of ethics than MAIs (for example, the Society stripped a number of former SRPA/MAIs of their SRPA 
status on ethical grounds, though those same persons continue to retain their MAI status); and (d) Defendants so arranged matters that SRPAs who nevertheless attempted to become MAIs were subject to subjective 
and arbitrary ""reviews"" and judgments by MAI panels whose members included direct competitors of the SRPA applicants. (Second Am. Compl. PP 29 (a)-(d).)"
154,3," Such is a necessary allegation to substantiate an association's direct claim. See Southwest Suburban Bd. of Realtors v. 
Beverly Area Planning Ass'n, 830 F.2d 1374, 1379-80 (7th Cir. 1987) (indicating that HN1[
] claim of injury to association itself 
is necessary to confer standing for a direct federal antitrust claim); Camel Hair & Cashmere Inst. of Am., Inc. v. Associated Dry 
Goods, 799 F.2d 6, 10 (1st Cir. 1986) (indicating that claim of injury to association itself is necessary to confer standing for a 
direct Lanham Act claim). "
157,4," The Court also questioned whether the plaintiff association could satisfy the third element of the Hunt test. See Southwest 
Suburban Bd. of Realtors v. Beverly Area Planning Ass'n, 830 F.2d at 1381. "
159,5," With respect to Counts I and II, the parties make no distinction between the two institutional Defendants. Neither, then, does 
the Court. Plaintiffs should be cautioned, however, that future analysis will require such a distinction. The corporate form should 
be considered in all future proof."
159,6," The Plaintiffs do not specifically allege any vicarious liability upon which the Court might include the individual Defendants in 
Counts I and II. It may be that the individual Defendants could be included in Counts I and II due to the Court's finding that each 
might be held liable under the conspiracy to monopolize alleged in Count III and discussed infra. If the individuals are found to 
have conspired to monopolize, under Count III, they may be liable for the acts of their coconspirators. See SEC v. Kimmes, 799 
F. Supp. 852 (N.D. Ill. 1992), aff'd, 997 F.2d 287 (7th Cir. 1993). This coconspirator theory of liability was not addressed by the 
parties in their memoranda. While there has been some question regarding this theory's applicability in antitrust cases, see 
Zenith Radio Corp. v. Matsushita Elec. Indus., 513 F. Supp. 1100, 1176-78 (E.D. Pa. 1981) (discussing potential applicability 
of Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 90 L. Ed. 1489, 66 S. Ct. 1180 (1946), to civil case based on Robison-Patman Act 
and Clayton Act claims), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 723 F.2d 238 (3d Cir. 1983), rev'd, 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 
2d 538 (1986), the Court sees no reason why it should not apply. See Sidney Morris & Co. v. National Ass'n of Stationers, 40 
F.2d 620 (7th Cir. 1930) (applying vicarious coconspirator liability to old precursor to Robinson-Patman Act). This issue might be 
raised by Defendants should Plaintiffs include a civil Pinkerton theory of liability in their final amended complaint. A second theory of liability, less commonly used in antitrust cases, that might be raised is an aiding and abetting theory. This 
theory is sometimes used in attempts to include labor unions as antitrust defendants. See Hunt v. Crumboch, 325 U.S. 821, 65 
S. Ct. 1545, 89 L. Ed. 1954 (1945). Like the coconspirator theory, this theory was not alleged by Plaintiffs or raised in argument. 
Its applicability to this case, like that of the coconspirator theory, remains to be resolved. "
160,7," The Court notes that United States v. National City Lines has been criticized, see Besser Publishing Co. v. Pioneer Press, Inc., 
571 F. Supp. 640, 641 (N.D. Ill. 1983); Tire Sales Corp. v. Cities Serv. Oil Co., 410 F. Supp. 1222, 1232 (N.D. Ill. 1976), rev'd, 
637 F.2d 467 (7th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 920, 68 L. Ed. 2d 312, 101 S. Ct. 1999 (1981), but it remains the law in this 
Circuit."
160,8," Since it was not addressed by the parties, the Court leaves open the issue of whether, in proving a claim for conspiracy under 
section 2, a plaintiff must prove that the conspirators collectively must be capable of achieving a monopoly or monopoly power."
160,9," The Plaintiffs' allegations against the individual Defendants, with the exception of Joe R. Price who is specifically mentioned in 
one other paragraph, are completely quoted as follows:"
160,13," . All of the individual defendants are holders of the MAI designation. They are, and have been at all material times, engaged in 
direct competition with plaintiffs, in interstate commerce in the United States, for non-residential real estate appraisal business. 
All of the individual defendants are or were officers or officials of the Society, AIREA, and/or the Appraisal Institute. Acting for "
161,," their own individual benefits and purposes, with intent to benefit themselves individually and/or through their various businesses, 
each of them participated with defendants AIREA and Appraisal Institute in implementing and furthering the MAIs' takeover of 
the Society, the elimination of competition from SRPAs, and the other wrongful conduct described in this Complaint. More 
particularly: (a) At all material times, each of defendants LOUIE REESE III, a resident of Alabama, and RITCH LeGRAND, a resident of 
Iowa, held the MAI designation. However, each also held a Society-conferred designation, and in that capacity Reese and 
LeGrand became presidents of the Society in 1989 and 1990 respectively and used their offices to urge the members of the 
Society to accept and vote for the AIREA ""unification"" scheme by which the MAIs effected the takeover of the Society and 
the crippling of competition from the SRPAs. (b) At all material times, each of defendants PATRICIA MARSHALL and BERNARD FOUNTAIN, residents of New York, 
and DOUGLAS BROWN, a resident of South Carolina, held the MAI designation. All of them were and are members of the 
Appraisal Institute's Executive Committee (Marshall was also President of the Institute and AIREA's First Vice President), 
and exercise substantial influence and control over the Appraisal Institute's operations. (c) In addition, defendant Fountain was a Society Vice-President in 1990 and is now a Director of the Society; and, though 
neither has ever earned nor held any designation conferred by the Society, defendant Marshall is currently the President of 
the Society and defendant Brown is currently the Treasurer of the Society. (d) At all material times, each of the defendants C. DAVID MATTHEWS, CLIFFORD E. FISHER, JR., JOHN R. 
UNDERWOOD, JR., BRUCE R. WILLMETTE, BONNIE D. ROERIG, DAVID F. PEATFIELD, DONALD L. BURKE, 
NANCY M. MUELLER, GERALD A. TEEL, and NORMAN E. HALL has held the MAI designation. Each of those 
defendants is a member of, and together those defendants control and operate, the General Appraisal Board (""GAB"") of the 
defendant Appraisal Institute. The GAB, which operates from the Institute's headquarters in Chicago, Illinois, controls the 
requirements for, and the conferring and promotion of, the MAI designation, and as a result of the MAIs' takeover of the 
Society also controls the promotion of the SRPA designation and the ability of SRPAs to become MAIs. (d)[sic] At all material times, defendant JOE R. PRICE has held the MAI designation and has been the Regional Chairman 
of the Appraisal Institute's ""Region X,"" which includes the entire State of Florida. (Second Am. Compl. P 13.) "
162,10," This approach includes a ""quick look"" at the reasonableness of the restraint. See 7 Phillip E. Areeda, Antitrust Law PP 
1510c, 1511 (1986). HN17[
] The ""quick look"" is a means by which the per se rule and ""rule of reason"" have been collapsed. The ""quick look"" means that the Court will first consider the justifications for the challenged restraint. A persuasive justification 
for an apparent illegal restraint may require further analysis which effectively converts a per se approach into a rule of reason 
analysis."
162,11," In amending this Count, Plaintiffs are directed to be cautious about the inclusion of both institutional Defendants. As was 
indicated in the Court's discussion of Plaintiffs' section 2 claims, the Appraisal Institute and AIREA cannot conspire with one 
another under Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984). "
163,12, These allegations are quoted as follows:
163,30," . Having effectively disenfranchised SRPAs and drastically impaired their ability to preserve competitive equality by obtaining 
the MAI designation, as described in PP 28 and 29 above, following the ""unification"" defendants have not only also failed to 
promote the SRPA designation (contrary to their pre-unification promises, see P 25 above), but in fact have actively denigrated 
the SRPA designation relative to the MAI designation and thereby unfairly, deceptively, and anti-competitively advantaged MAIs 
(including themselves) at the expense of SRPAs (including plaintiffs). Among numerous examples are the following, all of which, 
whether produced and disseminated by the Appraisal Institute or by one of its Chapters, were and are under defendants' 
supervision and control: (a) Within weeks of the ""unification"" effective date, an Appraisal Institute advertisement in Florida's most prominent real 
estate publication falsely stated that ""NOW THERE ARE ONLY TWO PROFESSIONAL DESIGNATIONS FOR 
APPRAISERS"" -- which the advertisement identified as: ""MAI Member Appraisal Institute SRA Senior Residential Appraiser"" -- and reinforced the falsehood by ""warning"" the consuming public that "
164,," ""Many call themselves appraisers but not all appraisers are professionals."" This tacit disparagement of SRPAs carried the imprimatur of the official Appraisal Institute logo. (b) Numerous Appraisal Institute advertisements in educational materials have made and continue to make no mention 
whatever of the SRPA designation. Instead, these advertisements feature two large logos (each over three times taller than 
the advertisement's largest type face) superimposed over the outline of the United States -- the SRA logo and (as the ""lead"" 
logo) the logo of ""MAI - American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers."" (c) Defendants have fostered a campaign of promotions and advertising designed to convey the false and misleading 
impression that the SRPA designation is at best irrelevant or non-existent, if not actually inferior and non-professional. In 
addition to the examples noted above, these have included advertisements, such as one in the January 30, 1991 BANKER 
AND TRADESMAN magazine, asking the buying public the question: ""Who in the world could give you the fair and square value of an oval office?"" The answer (under a picture of the White House) once again disparaged SRPAs: ""A Real Estate Appraiser certified as MAI. A designation of such demanding requirements that only 3% of the appraisers in 
America have qualified. Experience. Knowledge. Ethics. Professionalism. Performance. These are the reasons courts, 
banks, developers, brokers, and government agencies for over fifty years have sought out and relied upon MAI appraisals. 
The next time you require a real estate appraiser, demand an MAI."" (d) Numerous advertisements placed by individual Chapters of the Appraisal Institute treat SRPAs and the SRPA 
designation as nonexistent. The Chapters identify themselves, for example, as ""APPRAISAL INSTITUTE - CLEVELAND CHAPTER Awarding the MAI and SRA Professional Designations."" (e) Continuing the theme of SRPA non-existence and/or professional inferiority, an Appraisal Institute promotional piece put 
forth under defendants' supervision and control asserts -- falsely, since SRPAs are also members of the Institute -- that: ""The Appraisal Institute members hold two of the oldest and most respected professional designations in the 
real estate appraisal industry, the MAI (general appraisers specializing in all types of properties) and SRA 
(specialists in appraisals of individual properties of 1-4 units)."" (f) Even when defendants do not disparage SRPAs (and advantage MAIs) by omitting SRPAs outright, defendants' official 
publication descriptions denigrate SRPAs. Those publications state, for example, that MAIs ""are experienced,"" while 
SRPAs (if mentioned at all) merely ""have experience;"" that MAIs do ""valuation and evaluation,"" while SRPAs (if mentioned 
at all) merely do ""valuation;"" and that MAI is a ""professional membership designation,"" while SRPA is merely a 
""membership designation."
164,31," . Defendants' wrongful conduct described in P 30 above has not abated with time, despite numerous complaints and 
entreaties from plaintiffs. At the instance of defendant JOE R. PRICE, plaintiffs believe, still another disparaging advertisement 
was placed in the January, 1993 edition of Florida Trend, the best known real estate business publication in Florida, falsely 
stating that as a result of a recent merger ""MAI and SRA are the surviving designations . . ."" [Emphasis added]. Defendant 
Price, regional chairman for defendant Appraisal Institute's Region X, which includes Florida, is a competitor of, inter alia, 
plaintiffs Buckley and Buckley Appraisal Services, Inc. The address given in the advertisement is 1639 Forum Place, West Palm 
Beach, Florida, 33401, which on information and belief is the address of defendant Price's real estate appraisal business. On 
information and belief, defendant Price has also been instrumental in earlier disparaging advertising promulgated in Florida. (Second Am. Compl. PP 30-31.) "
165,13," Defendants also contend that Plaintiffs have made no allegations with respect to their goods or services which have been 
misrepresented. This concern is adequately addressed by the Second Amended Complaint. In this Count, Plaintiffs seek 
damages for the misrepresentation of the quality of their appraisal services. "
167,14," Contrary authority may be presented to the Court on a Motion for Summary Judgment, if appropriate."
167,15," The validity of the Wolf decision and the relationship between the commerical disparagement theory and the defamation 
theory may be raised on a motion for summary judgment, if appropriate. "
172,1," Named as Doug van Org in the Complaint, his attorneys spell his name Van Ort."
172,2, The motion was initially referred to Magistrate Judge Weisberg. 
173,3,"  HN1[
] Whenever a corporation shall violate any of the penal provisions of the antitrust laws, such violation shall be 
deemed to be also that of the individual directors, officers, or agents of such corporation who shall have authorized, 
ordered, or done any of the acts constituting in whole or in part such violation, and such violation shall be deemed a 
misdemeanor, and upon conviction therefor of any such director, officer, or agent he shall be punished by a fine of not 
exceeding $ 5,000 or by imprisonment for not exceeding one year, or by both, in the discretion of the court."
173,15, U.S.C. § 24. 
174,4," Since the first suit was dismissed by order of the court on Plaintiff's motion under Rule 41(a), no facts were established. It is 
doubtful that we would be required to accept as true the allegations of a prior complaint in deciding whether privity was 
established, absent facts giving rise to an estoppel against the plaintiff. Nevertheless, even accepting as true the relationships 
among the parties inferred from the first complaint, we cannot find privity here. "
176,5," We note that the Complaint does not allege that they specifically agreed not to deal with MCM, but rather alleges that they 
agreed to deal exclusively with OG. We do not therefore have to consider whether the facts of this case could somehow be 
shoehorned into the ""group boycott"" category of Sherman Act violations. See FTC v. Indiana Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 
458, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445, 106 S. Ct. 2009 (1986)."
176,6," We ask whether AB and FDC have monopoly power only because it is a prerequisite to any harm to consumers resulting from 
their agreeing to pay a higher price for rental equipment. A supplier such as MCM would not have standing to complain of a 
monopoly among exhibition contractors. See Associated Gen. Contractors, 459 U.S. at 537-43; In re Indus. Gas Antitrust Litig. 
(Bichan), 681 F.2d 514 (7th Cir. 1982). "
177,7," Although Tampa Electric was brought under section 3 of the Clayton Act, courts rely on its analysis for cases arising under 
sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. Since the proscription of section 3 of the Clayton Act is broader than that of sections 1 and 
2 of the Sherman Act, if a contract does not fall within the relevant market coverage of the former it is not forbidden by the latter. 
Collins, 844 F.2d at 478 n.4. "
178,8," Defendants contended that furnishing forklifts, materials handling, and personnel moving equipment at McCormick Place 
cannot constitute a market for antitrust purposes because there are other exhibition facilities within the Chicago metropolitan 
area. (Defs.' Br. at 11.) This was the wrong argument since it conceded that rentals to exhibition contractors was the relevant 
market. On a motion to dismiss, we must accept as true that the vast majority of the convention and trade show business in 
Chicago is conducted at McCormick Place, (Compl. P 72), and that AB and FDC together have 75% of the convention and trade 
show business there, (id. P 95). If the market is rentals to exhibition contractors, MCM has probably alleged sufficient 
anticompetitive effect."
178,9," It may appear contradictory that we have treated the rental of equipment at McCormick Place as a market in discussing MCM's 
claim of attempted monopolization by extortion, but have denied it is a relevant market here. In the first case, however, we look 
at competition from the standpoint of lessees and potential lessees of fork lift trucks to be used at McCormick place. They 
presumably need the equipment at McCormick place, not somewhere else, and the alleged actions undeniably impact the price 
they must pay. On the other hand, in reviewing an exclusive dealing arrangement for a good or service, we are instructed to look 
to the entire relevant market for that good or service, not just the part from which the plaintiff claims to have been excluded. We 
are to look at the economic effects from the standpoint of the competing supplier, not the potential purchaser with particular 
needs. Thus, although those needing fork lifts to be used at McCormick place and those supplying them to the Chicago area "
179,," meet in the same market whether there is an effect on competition depends upon which end of the telescope one is looking 
through."
179,10," HN9[
] Section 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 14, provides in pertinent part as follows: It shall be unlawful for any person . . . to lease or make a sale or contract for sale of goods, wares, merchandise, 
machinery, supplies, or other commodities, . . . for use, consumption, or resale within the United States, . . . or fix a price 
charged therefor, or discount from, or rebate upon, such price, on the condition, agreement, or understanding that the 
lessee or purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies, or other 
commodities of a competitor or competitors of the lessor or seller, where the effect of such lease, sale, or contract for sale 
or such condition, agreement or understanding may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in 
any line of commerce. "
183,1," As pertinent here, 12 U.S.C. § 1972 provides: (1) A bank shall not in any manner extend credit, lease or sell property of any kind, or furnish any service, or fix or vary the 
consideration for any of the foregoing, on the condition or requirement-- (A) that the customer shall obtain some additional credit, property, or service from such bank other than a loan, discount, 
deposit, or trust service; . . . . (C) that the customer provide some additional credit, property, or service to such bank, other than those related to and 
usually provided in connection with a loan, discount, deposit, or trust service; . . . . "
199,1," The term cogeneration refers to the operation of a facility that produces electrical and steam or forms of useful energy, such as 
heat. See 16 U.S.C. § 796(18)(A). This process can be more efficient than conventional power generation, thereby conserving 
fuel. "
200,2," See In re: Petition of Metropolitan Dade County for Expedited Consideration of Request for Provision of Self-Service 
Transmission, Order No. 17510, Docket No. 860786-EI, 87 FPSC 5:32 (May 5, 1987); infra pp. 5-6."
200,3," In a lawsuit pending in state court, Thermo and Dade County are litigating who was to blame for the decision to build such a 
large facility. TEC Cogeneration, Inc. v. Metro Dade County, No. 92-08605-CA-06 (Fla. Cir. Ct. for the 11th Judicial Circuit). Two 
administrative proceedings, which occurred as an outgrowth of the state suit, are also pending. The first challenges the propriety 
of sales made by the DGC. See petition of Metropolitan Dade County for a Declaratory Statement concerning the Sale of 
Cogenerated Power by South Florida Cogeneration Associates to Metropolitan Dade County, Docket No. 930490-EQ (May 18, 
1993) (petition for order that Downtown Government Center facility has been making improper retail sales of electricity). The 
second contests the fact that the DGC was a qualifying cogeneration facility under 16 U.S.C. § 796(18)(B) since its inception.

fully aired and resolved over the last twelve years by the FPSC and to reopen a legislative debate fought before the Dade 
County Board of Commissioners in 1987."
202,9," Originally, plaintiffs alleged violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, and violations of the Robinson-Patman 
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13, in addition to the Section 2 and state-law causes of action. Those claims, as well as all claims against each 
of the individual defendants, were voluntarily dismissed. See Order Amending This Court's Order on Pending Motions, filed 
February 17, 1994; Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Support of Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint (d.e. 140) at 2. "
203,10," These practices include incentives for interruptible rates, time-of-use rates, deferral rates and other terms designed to lower the customer's electric bill and deter 
the customers from using cogenerated power, . . . sometimes referred to by FPL personnel as 'creative rates.' [These 
incentives] were not offered by FPL to all its customers, but were aggressively marketed to customers whom FPL had 
identified as being 'at risk' to cogeneration, including customers whom FPL had discovered to be negotiating with the 
Joint Venture or with plaintiffs Thermo Electron Corp. or Rolls-Royce, Inc. Id. at P 59 (emphasis added)."

agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy, the court shall order the 
petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists, 
unless it determines that: [P] (a) The right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner; or [P] (b) Grounds exist for the 
revocation of the agreement. [P] (c) A party to the arbitration agreement is also a party to a pending court action or special 
proceeding with a third party, arising out of the same transaction or series of related transactions and there is a possibility of 
conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact. For purposes of this section, a pending court action or special proceeding 
includes an action or proceeding initiated by the party refusing to arbitrate after the petition to compel arbitration has been filed, 
but on or before the date of the hearing on the petition. This subdivision shall not be applicable to an agreement to arbitrate 
disputes as to the professional negligence of a health care provider made pursuant to Section 1295. [P] If the court determines 
that a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy exists, an order to arbitrate such controversy may not be refused on the 
ground that the petitioner's contentions lack substantive merit. [P] If the court determines that there are other issues between the 
petitioner and the respondent which are not subject to arbitration and which are the subject of a pending action or special 
proceeding between the petitioner and the respondent and that a determination of such issues may make the arbitration 
unnecessary, the court may delay its order to arbitrate until the determination of such other issues or until such earlier time as 
the court specifies. [P] If the court determines that a party to the arbitration is also a party to litigation in a pending court action or 
special proceeding with a third party as set forth under subdivision (c) herein, the court (1) may refuse to enforce the arbitration 
agreement and may order intervention or joinder of all parties in a single action or special proceeding; (2) may order intervention 
or joinder as to all or only certain issues; (3) may order arbitration among the parties who have agreed to arbitration and stay the 
pending court action or special proceeding pending the outcome of the arbitration proceeding; or (4) may stay arbitration 
pending the outcome of the court action or other special proceeding."" "

234,," purpose"" public figure, or may be accorded that status as to a particular issue of public concern. See, e.g., Anderson v. Liberty 
Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 246 n. 3, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202, 106 S. Ct. 2505 (1986). In response to a request for admissions, National NECA stated that it ""may be a limited public figure in the electrical construction 
industry for some purposes. . . ."" In its opposition to ABC's motion for summary judgment on the counterclaims, National NECA 
notes that it ""does not contest that it is required to prove that ABC made its defamatory statements with actual malice."" Even in 
the absence of that concession, I would conclude that the job targeting issue presented in this action is a matter of public 
interest, and that defendant National NECA is a public figure for the purposes of the statements at issue here. "
237,3," From the record submitted, it appears that between 1986 and January 1993, union contractors have obtained contracts on 
3911 of 7213 projects on which job-targeting funds have been available."
237,4," Plaintiffs New Tech and Phoenix have produced bid files or bid quotes for 86 of the 282 jobs they assert they have lost 
because of the OJTP. It appears that the job targeting wage concession was a determining factor in awarding 12 of these 86 
contracts."
237,5," Plaintiffs contend that the OJTP was not established through collective bargaining. Though I find that the record does not 
support that contention, a contrary conclusion should not alter the disposition of defendants' motion for summary judgment 
based on the non-statutory exemption. The Ninth Circuit has applied the non-statutory exemption to agreements between unions 
and employers that are not the result of collective bargaining. See Richards v. Neilsen Freight Lines, 810 F.2d 898, 905 (9th Cir. 
1987). "
241,6," Plaintiffs' reliance on Associated Press v. United States, 326 U.S. 1, 89 L. Ed. 2013, 65 S. Ct. 1416 (1945) is misplaced. The 
Associated Press, unlike Oregon NECA, actually sold a product."

than that."
281,7," I have serious reservations about whether the individual defendants, alleged to be on various ABA committees or carrying out 
the ABA's work in accrediting law schools, can conspire with the ABA. Section one of the Sherman Act applies only to concerted 
action, proof of which requires evidence of a relationship between at least two legally distinct persons or entities. Oksanen v.

doubtful that the individual defendants are acting as distinct entities apart from the ABA during an accreditation review. See id. 
(medical staff indistinct from hospital during peer review process). This opinion does not address that issue; I merely note that 
plaintiff's complaint, which alleged all defendants conspired with each other, may thus allege concerted activity which is legally 
impossible. "
282,8," HN7[
] The Clayton Act authorizes that an antitrust suit against a corporation can be brought in the judicial district where it is an inhabitant and also in any district where the corporation is found or transacts business.  15 U.S.C. § 22. This provision for 
nationwide service of process means that a federal district court's jurisdiction is coextensive with the boundaries of the United 
States.  American Trade Partners v. A-1 Int'l Importing Enter., Inc., 755 F. Supp. 1292, 1302 (E.D. Pa. 1990). This Clayton Act 
provision applies only to corporate, not individual, antitrust defendants.  Delong Equip. Co. v. Washington Mills Abrasive, 840 
F.2d 843, 848 (11th Cir. 1988). "
290,1," Longs argues that Sebastian cannot own a collective mark and cites F.R. LePage Bakery v. Roush Bakery Products Co., 851 
F.2d 351, 353 (Fed. Cir. 1988), withdrawn, vacated and remanded, 863 F.2d 43 (Fed. Cir. 1988), vacated and modified, 13 
USPQ2d 1045 (TTAB 1989) in that regard. In that case, the Federal Circuit held that where a corporation is making and selling 
its wares under a trademark, it is not entitled to own a collective mark registration. Accord TMEP § 1302 (""a collective mark must 
be owned by a collective entity even though the mark is used by the members of the collective.""); § 1303.01 (""a collective mark 
must be owned by a collective entity."") In this court's view, Le Page is distinguishable. Le Page involved the transfer of a collective mark to one of the members of the 
collective. Here, the Collective did not transfer ownership of the mark to one of the salon members. Rather, as in In re Stencel, 
Sebastian as a corporate entity created the collective and owns the mark. Sebastian is not a member of the Collective. 
Moreover, this Court can think of no logical reason (nor, apparently, did the U.S. Trademark Office in registering the collective 
marks) why corporate niceties should dictate the validity of a collective mark. Notably, in addressing the validity of collective 
marks, the Lanham Act and relevant case law seem to focus on how a mark is used rather than who owns it. HN5[
]"
290,2," Previously, some courts applied the anti-use-by-owner rule to collective marks. According to that rule, if the owner of a 
collective mark, rather than the members, used the mark to identify its own goods or services the mark was not a ""collective"" 
mark but a traditional trademark or service mark. McCarthy at § 19.34[1][b]. See, e.g., Aloe Creme Laboraties, Inc. v. American 
Soc. for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, Inc., 192 U.S.P.Q. 170, 173 (TTAB 1976). Significantly, however, in 1988, the Trademark Law Revision Act made clear that the anti-use-by-owner rule does not apply to 
collective marks; consequently, a collective mark owner can make dual use out of the marks. A collective mark can be used in 
such a way as to be both a collective mark as well as a traditional trademark or service mark. McCarthy at § 19.34[1][b], [2], 
TMEP § 1303.01. "
292,3," By contrast, where any purported shortcomings would be obvious to the customers, customers are not likely to be confused 
and, consequently, infringement will not be found. In Matrix, for example, Matrix argued that its hair care products were not 
genuine unless they were sold with accompanying consultative services. The Court rejected this argument and held that no 
customer shopping in the drugstore would be confused or deceived as to whether they were getting a cosmetologist's 
consultation.  Matrix, 988 F.2d at 591. Nor, the Court held, would confusion exist as to sponsorship because the goods were 
manufactured and labelled by Matrix. Id. at 592. See also H.L. Hayden Co. of N.Y., Inc. v. Siemens Medical Systems, Inc., 879 
F.2d 1005 (2d Cir. 1989) (Defendant's sale of plaintiff's dental equipment, sold through its catalog and without plaintiff's required 
installation, was nevertheless a ""genuine"" product, and customers would not likely be confused or deceived that the product did 
not include installation). HN10[
] "
293,4," Longs argues that Sebastian delayed in bringing this action, which in turn negates Sebastian's contentions of irreparable 
injury. Longs' argument is without merit. Admittedly, Sebastian has been on notice of Longs' sales since 1987 and only now 
seeks injunctive relief. However, Sebastian's Collective was not founded until June 1992. Sebastian did not attempt to utilize the 
trademark avenue until after it registered its collective mark, placed the mark on its goods, and in April 14, 1993, first learned 
that the defendant was selling Sebastian Product bearing the collective mark. Sebastian then filed suit on May 18, 1993. 
Sebastian did not, therefore, sleep on its rights. "
299,1," DME consists of canes, crutches, oxygen equipment, wheelchairs, walkers, hospital beds and other items used by persons

299,3," This was the second contract between Giles Memorial and Medserv. The first contract involved the provision of respiratory 
therapy services at the hospital and is not in issue here."
299,4," Indeed, both businesses had paid employees working in Giles Memorial's respiratory services department, and these 
employees roughly split referrals for DME. "
300,5," Although plaintiff's second amended complaint alleges that the contract was entered into in 1984, it is clear from the context of 
the complaint that plaintiff refers to the August 1, 1985 contract between Giles Memorial and Medserv."
300,6," Plaintiff's expert estimates that AHCS and McLean's combined market share exceeded 93 percent in 1985 prior to the entry of 
Home Connections in the DME market."
300,7," Although plaintiff has found a few specific instances of substandard quality of Home Connections' DME, Home Connections' 
inter-office memoranda suggest that the company was concerned about the lapses in quality; this concern seems unusual in a 
firm that was allegedly impervious to competition. "
301,8," As discussed in the monopolization section, plaintiff is also unable to establish that the objects and conduct pursuant to the 
contract were illegal or that it suffered antitrust injury."
301,9," In United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416, 424 (2d Cir. 1945), Judge Learned Hand suggested that while 90 
percent of the market ""is enough to constitute a monopoly, it is doubtful whether sixty or sixty-four percent would be enough; and 
certainly thirty-three percent is not."" See also White Bag Co. v. International Paper Co., 579 F.2d 1384, 1387 (4th Cir. 1974) 
(cases have shown that ""when monopolization has been found the defendant controlled seventy to one hundred percent of the 
relevant market""); Fineman v. Armstrong World Industries, Inc., 980 F.2d 171, 201-02 (3d Cir. 1992) (""A significantly larger 
market share than 55 percent has been required to demonstrate prima facie monopoly power.""), cert. denied, 122 L. Ed. 2d 677, 
113 S. Ct. 1285 (1993); Domed Stadium Hotel, Inc. v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 732 F.2d 480, 489 and 489-90 n. 11 (5th Cir. 1984) 
(requiring a market share of at least 50 percent); P. Areeda and H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 518.3c at 549 (1992 Supp.) 
(""There is substantial merit in a presumption that market shares below 50 or 60 percent do not constitute monopoly power."")."
301,10," Plaintiff does not deny these errors; rather, plaintiff asserts that the correct measure of market share is in new referrals, not 
revenues. Dr. Blair claims that Home Connections secured over 78 percent of DME referrals from Giles Memorial. This statistic 
is not relevant, however, because the proper geographic market for this analysis is Giles County, not Giles Memorial Hospital."
301,11," It is significant that Super-Aid Pharmacy entered the market during the period of alleged monopoly power. The DME market is 
characterized by low barriers to entry, which makes exercise of monopoly power nearly impossible, as any attempt to raise 
prices above the competitive level will lure into the market new competitors able and willing to offer their commercial goods for 
less. See Syufy Enterprises, 903 F.2d at 664-65. "
302,12," During the relevant period, market concentration lessened notably as Home Connections, AHCS and McLean's all possessed 
more than 10 percent market shares and the smaller DME suppliers' business grew."
302,13," For example, no records of discharged Giles Memorial patients who selected AHCS were found; Dr. Blair therefore 
speculates that AHCS received zero percent of DME orders by former Giles Memorial patients from 1985-1990."
302,14," Plaintiff's one witness who claimed to have not been informed of alternative DME suppliers, Mrs. Ethelene Atwell, later 
recanted her affidavit, explaining that she did not understand the affidavit that she signed for plaintiff."
302,15," Similarly, Mary Ellen Britts and Don Walker have no personal knowledge of whether defendants steered Giles Memorial 
patients to Home Connections. Their testimony preeented by plaintiff is inadmissible hearsay, as is Lawhorn's assertion that he 
heard that physicians were coerced to refer patients to Home Connections. "
303,16," In Twin Laboratories, Inc. v. Weider Health & Fitness, 900 F.2d 566, 570-71 (2d Cir. 1990), the Second Circuit cautioned that 
the Berkey Photo discussion of what later became known as 'monopoly leveraging"" was mere dictum and involved a classic 
tying claim. Therefore, it is unclear if the Second Circuit would recognize monopoly leveraging as distinct from a tying or 
monopolization claim. See Sunshine Cellular v. Vanguard Cellular Systems, Inc., 810 F. Supp. 486, 495 n.7 (S.D.N.Y. 1992). "
304,17," As discussed in the monopolization section, Home Connections' market share fell significantly (from 43 to 34 percent) from 
1989 to 1990, which is further evidence that there was no dangerous probability of monopolization of the DME market by 
defendants. See Richter Concrete, 691 F.2d at 826. Finally, the fact that Home Connections so swiftly went out of business 
makes the likelihood of monopolization seem quite remote. See Lektro-Vend Corp. v. Vendo Co., 660 F.2d 255, 270-71 (7th Cir. 
1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 921, 71 L. Ed. 2d 461, 102 S. Ct. 1277 (1982). "
311,1," Defendants contend that this information is collateral to the issues in this action and that plaintiff should be sanctioned for 
bringing it to the court's attention. Defs.' Mem. at 5. Although plaintiff has also made reference to this decision in connection with 
its request for punitive damages, this information first came to light in connection with plaintiff's request for an order of seizure. In "
312,," that regard, this information was probative of whether an ex parte order was appropriate. The decision to award punitive 
damages, infra, is not based on this information. However, as the discussion which follows concerning the attempted seizure of 
the Chattel makes clear, Defendants' actions were commensurate with the allegations in People of the State of New York v. 
Michael Oldsmobile Corp., et al., No. 43145/90-001."

(ERK), Crest and Metro seek damages against Hudson Toyota and others based on, among other things, an alleged violation of 
New York's Donnelly Act, N.Y. Gen. Bus. L. § 340 (McKinney 1988). "
313,3, Both parties agree that New York law applies. 
314,4," Plaintiff also argues that punitive damages are appropriate because Defendants' breach harmed the public in general because 
the persons who purchased the cars were not given the appropriate documentation evidencing ownership. However, there is no 
indication in the record that Defendants' activities were aimed at the public in general; rather, harm to the public was a byproduct 
of Defendants' actions."
314,5," Local Rule 3(g) provides in relevant part that ""all material facts set forth in the statement required to be served by the moving

315,6," This was the only logical conclusion because other than presenting the car to Defendants as a gift, there is no other 
reasonable justification for plaintiff's actions (i.e., transferring the Chattel without receiving a check). "
318,7," Counsel defends the motion to quash on the ground that during a telephone conversation with one of Chambers' law clerks, 
and in response to Counsel's query, he was informed that an order to show cause was not necessary since the Chattel had not 
been seized and counsel should therefore proceed via a regular motion. Sanctions, however, are appropriate because of the 
legal and factual paucity of the motion, not because it was procedurally infirm. "
320,8," Defendants were put on notice that this counterclaim set-off would lead to a motion for sanctions. Affidavit of Marjorie E. 
Berman, March 2, 1994, Ex. A (letter of January 25, 1994 to Defendants' attorney). In fact, Defendants' law firm again 
telephoned the law clerk referenced above in footnote 7 on January 26, 1994, the date of the Answer, and informed the clerk 
that plaintiff had threatened the firm with sanctions and asked if the Court would advise the firm on the propriety of asserting the 
antitrust counterclaims. The court declined to issue an advisory opinion. "
335,1," The HM-3, manufactured by Dornier Medical Systems, received premarket approval from the FDA in 1984 and was the only 
lithotripter approved for sale in this country until 1988. Approximately 197 HM-3's were sold in the United States. Dornier ceased 
producing the HM-3 in 1987, with the advent of competing ""second-generation"" lithotripters using improved technology. In 1988, 
the FDA approved two new lithotripter manufacturers, Medstone and Siemens, and in 1991 Dornier received approval to sell its 
own second-generation lithotripter, the MFL 5000. "
336,2," The shocktube replacement part contains three components: a lens, a coil, and a membrane. Siemens does not sell these 
components, only the modular part itself. However, Siemens AG manufacturers the components, and Servicetrends claims it is 
unable to obtain them from any other source. "
337,3," Section 2 provides: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspires with any other person or persons, 
to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty 
of a felony . . . ."
337,15, U.S.C. § 2.
337,4," Market power is the measure of a firm's ability to raise prices above competitive levels without losing profits from decreased 
sales. The economic evil of monopoly power is simply the threat that a firm with excessive market share will charge more than a 
competitive price for the monopolized product. Because the actual data needed to prove monopoly pricing is rarely available, courts typically use ""market share"" as a 
convenient proxy. A firm's market share is the percentage of its unit sales to total market sales. Judge Hand originated the 
classic guidelines of market share sufficient to constitute monopoly power -- 90% market share constitutes a monopoly, 64% is 
""doubtful,"" and 33% is not enough. See United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416, 424 (2d Cir. 1945); see also "
338,," Grinnell, 86 S. Ct. at 1704 (80% market share is a ""substantial monopoly""; 87% ""leaves no doubt"" of monopoly power; and 
agreeing Judge Hand's 90% ""constituted monopoly power"") (citations omitted). The Second Circuit explained: ""Sometimes, but 
not inevitably, it will be useful to suggest that a market share below 50% is rarely evidence of monopoly power, a share between 
50% and 70% can occasionally show monopoly power, and a share above 70% is usually strong evidence of monopoly power."" 
Broadway Delivery Corp. v. United Parcel Serv., 651 F.2d 122, 129 (2d Cir. 1981). Where the record showed that a defendant 
exercised market share of only 21%-27% in one market and 16% in another, the Fifth Circuit concluded that ""market shares in 
the range of 16 to 25 percent . . . are insufficient -- at least absent other compelling structural evidence -- as a matter of law to 
support monopolization."" Dimmitt Agri Indus., Inc. v. CPC Int'l Inc., 679 F.2d 516, 529 (5th Cir. 1982)."
338,5," The concept of cross-elasticity of demand is critical to determining which products are included in the total market from which a 
producer's market share is determined. When the price of a product rises above a competitive level, consumers seek to 
substitute products that are reasonably interchangeable. The relevant product market therefore includes competing products. 
See U.S. Anchor Mfg., Inc. v. Rule Indus., Inc., 7 F.3d 986, 995 (11th Cir. 1993). A defendant's share of the total product market 
is calculated as its unit sales divided by the total unit sales of all the firms producing the same, or reasonably similar, products. 
Failing to consider reasonably substitutable products in the market share calculation understates the size of the total market and 
overstates the market power of the defendant. "
339,6," Because Defendant has supported its motion for summary judgment with affirmative evidence demonstrating that Plaintiff will 
be unable to prove an element of the claims pertaining to a market for all lithotripters, the Court need not address Defendant's 
contention that Siemens' 18% market share is insufficient as a matter of law to establish market power or a dangerous 
probability of success. "
341,7," Plaintiff's damages expert, John Preston, testified that Servicetrends' interest cost resulting from Defendant's refund policy 
amounted to approximately $ 9,000, compared to service revenues of $ 2,141,506 for the same period. See Preston Depo., 
Defendant's Exh. 4, pp. 78-81. "
342,8," Defendant offers a number of business justifications for its allegedly monopolistic conduct. Although legitimate business 
reasons can serve as a defense for a monopolist's exclusionary acts and refusal to deal, see, e.g., Oahu Gas Serv., Inc. v. 
Pacific Resources, Inc., 838 F.2d 360, 368-69 (9th Cir. 1988) (and cases cited therein), ""whether valid business reasons 
motivated a monopolist's conduct is a question of fact."" High Technology Careers v. San Jose Mercury News, 996 F.2d 987, 990 
(9th Cir. 1993) (citing Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Serv., Inc., 119 L. Ed. 2d 265, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 2091 (1992)). 
However, having determined that SMS is not required to sell the patented shocktube components as a matter of law, this Court 
need not decide whether factual questions precluding summary judgment exist regarding the validity of Defendant's asserted 
justifications. "
343,9," Plaintiff does not suggest that its price discrimination charge implicates either the Robinson-Patman Act (amending § 2 of the 
Clayton Act) or antitrust restrictions against resale price maintenance agreements, ruled a per se violation of the Sherman Act by 
Dr. Miles and progeny. See Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co., 220 U.S. 373, 31 S. Ct. 376, 55 L. Ed. 502 
(1911). Instead, Plaintiff argues that the price discount provided to Med-Lab and not to Servicetrends is a form of anticompetitive 
conduct. See Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition [#155], pp. 23-26. Therefore, the Court specifically restricts its review of the 
Med-Lab Representation Agreement to the narrow issue of whether Plaintiff's practice of extending a price discount to Med-Lab 
is anticompetitive."
343,10," Section 2(a) of the Robinson-Patman Act makes it illegal for a seller to discriminate in price between customers. ""Price 
discrimination"" in this context means ""price difference."" A seller discriminates whenever the difference in price charged to 
customers does not reflect a difference in the marginal cost of selling to them. However, the statute does not ban all price 
differences charged to different customers. Instead, the statute provides a number of important limitations, including a defense 
permitting price discrimination based on differences in costs: ""nothing herein contained shall prevent differentials which make 
only due allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture, sale, or delivery resulting from the differing methods or quantities . 
. . [sold]."" 15 U.S.C. § 13(a). See, e.g., Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 125 L. Ed. 2d 168, 113 S. Ct. 
2578, 2586 (1993). "
344,11," Tying arrangements are nominally regarded as per se illegal, but the law has undergone substantial changes in recent years 
and modern tying cases indicate that tying may be subject to a ""rule of reason"" balancing approach. See, e.g., Jefferson Parish 
Hosp. v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2 (1984) (four Justices favor removing tying from the per se category of 
antitrust offenses). This evolution in judicial thinking is based on a reevaluation of the economic theory associated with tying. 
Originally, tying was condemned because of a fear that a firm with monopoly power in the tying product market would be able to "
345,," use that power as a lever into the tied product market. For example, a monopolistic seller of copy machines might be able to 
monopolize the paper market if it was allowed to tie the sale of copy paper to the sale of the machine. The leverage theory 
underpinning the per se treatment of tying has lost favor, however, as economists today generally concede that tying cannot 
transfer monopoly power from one market to another."
345,12," Section 1 does not mention ""tying,"" but prohibits contracts in restraint of trade: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."
345,15, U.S.C. § 1.
345,13," Plaintiff states: ""Count I of the Complaint alleges that SMS has illegally tied the sale of Lithostar replacement parts (the tying 
product) to the sale of Lithostar repair and service (the tied product)."" Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition [#155], p. 45. "
346,14," Plaintiff's expert Noll testified: ""I thus far have seen no evidence that would support the notion that there's a separate market 
for each of those specific components that go into the shockhead."" Defendant's Exh. 1, p. 77. Similarly, Defendant's expert Shapiro testified that there is no separate relevant parts market in this case. Shapiro Depo., 
Defendant's Exh. 60, pp. 36-37."
346,15," Plaintiff points to Defendant's execution of an equipment Repurchase Agreement with the Endourological Institute of Puerto 
Rico as an example of an illegal tie between sales and service. The Agreement concerned a common financing requirement by 
an equipment lessor that the lessee-buyer designate a third party to assume the debt and remarket the equipment in the event 
of default. SMS, at the request of the buyer and the lender, agreed to repurchase the equipment if requested, but only if SMS 
performed the maintenance during the equipment's service life. This arrangement was made to facilitate financing of the 
equipment and lacks any indication of coercion. "
348,16," In this context, ""direct cost"" refers to parts and labor costs only. Other cost allocations reflecting general and administrative 
expenses, plus the ""necessary minimum profit"" component mentioned in McGahee, must be added to derive a total average 
cost. Hence, this direct cost estimate is lower than a comparable total cost figure and strengthens Plaintiff's assertion of 
predatory intent. Also, these costs are stated in 1988 dollars, versus the revenue figures found in Defendant's 1992 service 
contracts. Inflation during the intervening four years tends to overstate the income from service contracts and narrow the real 
amount by which costs exceed revenues. "
349,17," Plaintiff also cites several SMS internal memoranda as comprising the type of ""subjective evidence"" referred to by the 
McGahee court. Having reviewed the documents, the Court agrees that a fact finder could reasonably find them probative of 
predatory intent."
349,18," Like tying arrangements, exclusive dealing contracts are also prohibited by § 3 of the Clayton Act. Although the possibility of 
different treatment for similar activities exists depending on whether the court applies the Sherman Act or the Clayton Act, "
350,," Clayton Act cases are particularly instructive in analyzing exclusive dealing claims brought under the Sherman Act. 
Nevertheless, there are critical distinctions between the two Acts involving sales of services and plaintiff's burden of proof."
350,19," The evidence conflicts as to whether Lithotripters, Inc. currently has twenty-four, twenty-six, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, or thirty 
service agreements with SMS. See Jordon Depo., Plaintiff's Exh. 4, p. 22, (Lithotripters, Inc. owns 29 or 30 Lithostars); 
McCumber Depo., Defendant's Exh. 45, p. 203 (Lithotripters, Inc. owns 26 Lithostars); Plaintiff's Supplemental Brief (at least 28 
machines are under long-term service contracts with SMS); Defendant's Supplemental Brief, Murphy Depo. (Lithotripters, Inc. 
owns 25 Lithostars, 24 are subject to an SMS service agreement, plus two additional machines owned by a third party with 
whom Jordon is affiliated). Twenty-six service agreements would equal 32% of the relevant market of 80 Lithostars, while thirty 
agreements is equivalent to 38%. The Court resolves this factual discrepancy in favor of Plaintiff and assumes that Defendant's 
exclusive agreements foreclose approximately 38% of the market for Lithostar service. "
352,20," HN22[
] The Lanham Act provides: Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or services . . . uses in commerce any . . . false or misleading 
description of fact, or false or misleading representation of fact, which -- (A) is likely to cause confusion . . . or to deceive as to the . . . approval of his or her goods . . . by another person, or (B) in commercial advertising or promotion, misrepresents the . . . qualities . . . of his or her or another person's goods 
. . . shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act."
352,15, U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1). 
354,21," Although evidence at trial may force a different conclusion, Mr. Shapiro persuasively explained the relevant geographic 
market in this case: "
355,," I believe Siemens competes in a US market for lithotripsy systems. . . . In this case, its really supply-side substitutability that 
drives the geographic definition of the market. Specifically, a manufacturer who is selling lithotriptors [sic] in one part of the 
country can quite easily make them available for sale or make a system available for sale in another part of the country. Shapiro Depo., Plaintiff's Exh. A, p. 65. It follows that the geographic market for the associated parts and service is the same: 
""when I said a manufacturer who is selling in one part of the country can sell in another part of the country . . . they would have 
to make the parts and service available in that other part of the country."" Id. at pp. 65-66. This is the same geographic market identified by Servicetrends' expert, Roger Noll. See Plaintiff's Exh. B, p. 10. "
358,22," Georgia courts have long held that trade secrets are protectable only when they truly are secrets. The Georgia Supreme 
Court described the typical plaintiff's allegations in a trade secrets case in Vendo Co. v. Long: The allegations in this connection are in substance: that the defendant became familiar with plaintiff's trade secrets, 
experimental data, and other confidential information concerning names of customers, equipment, prices of machines, price 
quotations to customers, new models of plaintiff's machines not yet on the market and their prices, method of doing 
business and procedures . . . . The allegations in this case respecting trade secrets and confidential information seem to encompass practically every 
phase of the plaintiff's business . . . . But in none of these does there appear to be any element of secrecy or confidential 
information that is peculiar to the plaintiff's business and known only to it and its employees. Vendo Co. v. Long, 213 Ga. 774, 776-77, 102 S.E.2d 173 (1958); see also Textile Rubber & Chem. Co. v. Shook, 243 Ga. 587, 
589, 255 S.E.2d 705 (1979) (Georgia definition of a trade secret requires that it is ""known only to its owner and those of his 
employees to whom it must be confided in order to apply it to the uses intended"") (citation omitted). "
359,23," See also Haist Affidavit, Plaintiff's Exh. J, P 4 (""There is no information concerning the Lithostar which is kept secret from 
customers purchasing the equipment. A customer is given the same service manual with a purchased Lithostar that service 
technicians such as myself are supplied with.""); Conner Affidavit, Plaintiff's Exh. K (same). "
366,1," Door County Material Specialists, Inc., Portside's corporate purchaser was also a named defendant.  For purposes of 
discussing the issues raised on appeal, we refer to Portside and DCMS collectively as Portside."
366,2," HN1[
] Section 133.05, Stats., provides in part: Secret rebates; unfair trade practices.  (1) The secret payment or allowance of rebates, refunds, commissions or unearned 
discounts, whether in the form of money or otherwise, or the secret extension to certain purchasers of special services or 
privileges not extended to all purchasers purchasing upon like terms and conditions, such payment, allowance or extension 
injuring or tending to injure a competitor or destroying or tending to destroy competition, is an unfair trade practice and is 
prohibited. (2) No person may induce, solicit or receive anything of value which is prohibited under sub. (1). (3) Any person knowingly violating this section may be fined not more than $ 25,000 or imprisoned in the county jail for not 
more than one year or both."
366,3," The jury verdict inquired only into the acts of the seller, Lampert, and not the acts of the buyer, Portside.  Section 133.05(2), 
Stats., sets forth the prohibited conduct of a buyer. The jury was not asked whether Portside induced, solicited or received 
anything of value which is prohibited under sub. (1) of § 133.05. Despite this apparent discrepancy, Portside does not reply to C&E's argument on appeal: Portside conceded that if the jury found that Lampert had extended an unearned discount or special privilege to Portside 
within the meaning of sec. 133.05(1), then Portside ""induced, solicited or received"" this benefit under sec. 133.05(2).  That 
is why the jury was not even asked if Portside induced, solicited or received the unearned discount or secret privilege.  
Having failed to object to the jury instruction below -- indeed, having acquiesced in the instructions which failed to require a 
showing that receipt be ""knowing"" -- Portside has waived any claim to the contrary on appeal.  See Segall v. Hurwitz, 114 
Wis. 2d 471, 489, 339 N.W.2d 333, 342 (Ct. App. 1983) (noting that court will ""normally . . . not review an issue raised for 
the first time on appeal"")."
366,4," HN2[
] Section 133.04, Stats., provides in part: "
367,," Price discrimination; intent to destroy competition.  (1) No person may discriminate, either directly or indirectly, in price 
between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, for the purpose or intent of injuring or destroying 
competition in any level of competition or any person engaged therein. (2) Any person violating this section may be fined not more than $ 25,000 or imprisoned in the county jail for not more than 
one year or both."
367,5," HN3[
] Section 133.18(1)(a), Stats., provides: Treble damages; statute of limitations.  (1) (a) Except as provided under par. (b), any person injured, directly or indirectly, 
by reason of anything prohibited by this chapter may sue therefor and shall recover threefold the damages sustained by the 
person and the cost of the suit, including reasonable attorney fees.  Any recovery of treble damages shall, after trebling, be 
reduced by any payments actually recovered under s. 133.14 for the same injury."
367,6," We agree with Portside's uncontested contention that it can be retried only as to the allegation that it violated § 133.05, Stats.  
The jury exonerated Portside of making a contract with Lampert in restraint of trade under § 133.03.  Absent any conspiracy by a 
buyer, the prohibition against price discrimination under § 133.04 applies on its face only to a seller."
367,7," Wis JI -- Civil 200 sets forth the ""ordinary"" burden of proof: The burden of proof . . . is to satisfy you to a reasonable certainty, by the greater weight of the credible evidence . . . . By the greater weight of the credible evidence is meant evidence which when weighed against evidence opposed to it has 
more convincing power.  Credible evidence is evidence which in the light of reason and common sense is worthy of belief. Wis JI -- Civil 205 sets forth the ""middle"" burden of proof: ""The burden of proof . . . is . . . to convince you to a reasonable 
certainty by evidence that is clear, satisfactory, and convincing . . . ."" "
368,8," Wisconsin's pattern jury instructions also suggest use of the middle burden in civil conspiracy claims, Wis JI -- Civil 2800; 
intentional interference with a contractual relationship, Wis JI -- Civil 2780; bad faith claims against insurance companies, Wis JI 
-- Civil 2761; and misrepresentation claims, Wis JI -- Civil 2401-2402.  The supreme court has recognized the instruction 
committee's work as persuasive.  State v. Gilbert, 115 Wis. 2d 371, 379, 340 N.W.2d 511, 515-16 (1983)."
368,9," HN6[
] The federal courts do not require middle burden protection in civil actions regulating commerce, even where fraud is 
involved.  Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U.S. 375, 389 (1983) (claims of fraudulent misrepresentation under the 
federal Securities Exchange Act may be proven by a preponderance of the evidence). "
369,10," HN9[
] Section 133.01, Stats., provides: Legislative intent.  The intent of this chapter is to safeguard the public against the creation or perpetuation of monopolies 
and to foster and encourage competition by prohibiting unfair and discriminatory business practices which destroy or 
hamper competition.  It is the intent of the legislature that this chapter be interpreted in a manner which gives the most 
liberal construction to achieve the aim of competition.  It is the intent of the legislature to make competition the fundamental 
economic policy of this state and, to that end, state regulatory agencies shall regard the public interest as requiring the 
preservation and promotion of the maximum level of competition in any regulated industry consistent with the other public 
interest goals established by the legislature."
369,11," C&E's evidence would tend to demonstrate that in this case.  C&E refers to a public meeting between Lampert and its 
contractors where Lampert ""falsely told contractors that all contractors received the same discount."" C&E cites evidence that 
other contractor prices were left openly on display on a front counter except for Portside's, which were kept in Lampert's back 
offices, even though each was used on a daily basis.  C&E refers to evidence that Lampert furnished Portside with lists reflecting 
Lampert's charges to other contractors on a competitively bid project, ostensibly to give Portside a competitive advantage. "

1986). See also Provident Bank v. Manor Steel Corp., 882 F.2d 258, 261 (7th Cir. 1989) (when a matter has been referred to a 
Magistrate Judge acting as a special master or § 636(b)(2) jurist, a party waives his right to appeal if he has not first preserved 
the issues for appeal by presenting them to the District Judge as objections). "
388,1," Other plaintiffs were Teri Norton, Sherri Chretien, Janice Kimler, Tessia Innocenti, Angela Christine Maroney, Melissa 
Whittaker Duran, and Tracey Freezia Leudeman. "
390,2," Since we conclude that the indirect-purchaser doctrine does not deprive plaintiffs of standing under the DTPA, we need not 
and do not determine whether the doctrine actually applies to the Texas Antitrust Act; nor do we determine whether, if the 
indirect-purchaser doctrine does apply to that Act, it deprives the court of subject matter jurisdiction or is simply a proper ground 
for judgment on the merits against the indirect purchaser. Cf.  Texas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 
440, 444 (Tex. 1993) (holding that the standing requirement ""is implicit in the open courts provision, [Tex. Const. art. I, § 13], 
which contemplates access to the courts only for those litigants suffering an in jury""). "
391,3," It is important to note that the indirect-purchaser doctrine is nor founded on the principle that the antitrust defendant's conduct 
is legal under the antitrust laws. Rather, it is founded on the principle that indirect purchasers are not the proper parties to seek 
enforcement of those laws. See Kansas v. Utilicorp United, Inc., 497 U.S. 199, 203-04, 111 L. Ed. 2d 169, 110 S. Ct. 2807 
(1990). Thus the DTPA and the Texas Antitrust Act do not regulate defendants' conduct in an inconsistent manner. "
392,4, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 581-1 to 581-41 (West 1964 & Supp. 1994).
392,5," Even then, such a summary judgment generally can be granted only after the non-movant has had an opportunity to amend 
his pleadings after special exceptions have been sustained. See Texas Dep't of Corrections v. Herring, 513 S.W.2d 6, 9-10 (Tex. 
1974). In the present case, the trial court followed this procedure. "
393,6," The supreme court did not give much guidance as to whether these four terms should be construed in the conjunctive (i.e. 
glaringly noticeable, flagrant, complete, and unmitigated) or disjunctive (i.e. glaringly noticeable, or flagrant, or complete and 
unmitigated). Although the court's phrase contains the term ""and,"" this usage is not conclusive, because the court quoted 
Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1002 (1976) for its definition of the term ""gross."" The fact that the court relied on a 
dictionary definition supports the argument that the phrase should be read in the disjunctive, since dictionaries often list several 
synonyms for a word when they define it. We believe there is a large difference between, for example, a price disparity that is 
""glaringly noticeable"" or ""flagrant"" and one that is ""complete and unmitigated."" However, because we find that plaintiffs' 
allegations are sufficient under either construction, we do not decide this issue."
393,7," Determining value is not a simple task. Plaintiffs apparently assume that the wholesale cost per can of the infant formula is the 
""value"" of the formula. Although this may or may not be true, defendants did not present summary judgment evidence to the 
contrary. Thus, reading the pleadings in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, for purposes of evaluating the pleadings' 
sufficiency, we assume that the wholesale cost per can is the ""value"" per can."
393,8," We do not hold that a mere price disparity alone, even a large one, is enough to meet the test of unconscionability. Rather, to 
be glaringly noticeable, flagrant, complete, and unmitigated, it may well be that there must be a gross price disparity ""plus"" some 
type of culpable conduct. See, e.g., LaChalet Int'l, Inc. v. Nowik, 787 S.W.2d 101, 105-06 (Tex. App.--Dallas 1990, no writ) 
(disparity in price and value received accompanied by several misrepresentations); Butler v. Joseph's Wine Shop, inc., 633 
S.W.2d 926, 931-32 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1982, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (gross disparity between price paid and value 
received caused by defendant's selling of goods to someone else and then refusing to return the money). In this case, plaintiffs "
394,," have alleged that defendants conspired to raise prices and to prevent direct advertising and forestall market entry. Such 
allegations are enough to satisfy a ""price disparity plus"" standard. "
412,1," Plaintiff has also alleged the following claims: 1) Counts II - XI: Illegal Tying Arrangements; 2) Count XII: Monopolization - 
Sherman Act § 2; 3) Count XIII: Unfair Competition - Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200; and 4) Count XIV: Tortious Interference 
with Prospective Economic Advantage - California Common Law. "
417,1," The Federal Defendants' assertion of these defenses only applies to the RICO claim because this Court dismissed Bieter's 
tortious interference claim as it applied to the Federal Defendants in its June 14, 1991 Order. "
419,2," Specifically, Cliff Road Defendants argue the following regarding Bieter's RICO claim: [Bieter] . . . deliberately refused to reapply even though it was urged to do so by the City Council and even though after the 
November 1987 elections the candidates who were beholden to Bieter controlled the City Council. "
420,," (Cliff Road Defs'. Mem. Opp. Pl's. Mot. for Partial Summ. J. at 14-15.) In addition, regarding Bieter's RICO and tortious 
interference claims, they argue: Once Bieter realized it could not obtain Target through legitimate means . . . it conspired with Dorsey to aid Cliff Road 
Properties in their solicitation and acquisition of Target as a tenant for [Cliff Lake Centre]. That way, Bieter could sue them 
for allegedly interfering with their relationship with Target. (Id. at 17.)"
420,3," In its Memorandum in Support of Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, Bieter states that it ""does not seek equitable relief, but 
rather seeks damages."" (Pl's. Mem. Supp. Mot. for Summ. J. at 7.) "
424,1," In its March 1, 1994 order, the Court awarded Tilton costs in the amount of $ 119,316.46. See 3/1/94 Order on Motions to Re-
tax Costs."
424,2," See 11/2/93 Order Clarifying Judgment, at 2."
424,3," See 11/18/93 Order Re: Motion for Reconsideration on Clayton Costs, at 3-5 (distinguishing between ""costs"" and ""out-of-
pocket"" expenses)."
424,4," Postjudgment interest is not calculable at this time because it covers the period from the date of entry of judgment ""until 
payment of the money judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1961;"" in this case, payment of money judgment has been stayed 
pending appeal. See 11/3/93 Judgment; 12/7/93 Stipulation and Order Re: Stay of Execution of Money Judgment Pending Post-
trial Motions and Appeal. "
428,5," AP's argument that Tilton's requested expenses are not of the type normally billed to fee-paying clients was rejected previously 
by this Court. See 11/18/93 Order, at 4. "
429,6," AP argues that Tilton should not recover these expenses because it could have used the regular mail instead. However, 
because of the numerous ex parte and emergency applications submitted in this case, the Court finds that Tilton's expenses on 
this item are reasonable. "
430,7," Tilton submits documentation supporting the fact that it deposed Carroll Smith on October 23, 1992, but the Court has not 
been able to locate any separate document setting forth Smith's expert witness fee. Accordingly, the Court does not award Tilton 
any such fee. "
437,1," For the judicial epilogue of Celotex, see Catrett v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 263 U.S. App. D.C. 399, 826 F.2d 33 (D.C. Cir.

452,1," At oral argument plaintiff expressly abandoned a fifth statutory cause of action, based on the Unruh Civil Rights Act ( Civ. 
Code, § 51.5). Our discussion of the complaint will, naturally, disregard this count. In light of plaintiff's abandonment, however, 
we will direct the trial court to sustain the demurrer to this court."
452,2," Insurance Code sections 790- 790.10 are often referred to as the ""Unfair Practices Act."" (See Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman's Fund 
Ins. Companies (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287, 292 [250 Cal.Rptr. 116, 758 P.2d 58]; Royal Globe Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1979) 23 
Cal.3d 880, 883 [153 Cal.Rptr. 842, 592 P.2d 329], overruled in Moradi-Shalal, supra, 46 Cal.3d at pp. 292, 304.) The 
Legislature, however, has mysteriously labeled this portion of the Insurance Code the ""Unfair Trade Practices Act."" ( Ins. Code, 
§ 1620.2, subd. (a), italics added.) It has given the name ""Unfair Practices Act"" to sections 17000 through 17101 of the Business 
and Professions Code. ( Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17000.) The Supreme Court has used that name to refer not only to those 
sections but also to section 17200 et seq. ( Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 377, 395 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 
487, 826 P.2d 730]; State of California ex rel.  Van de Kamp v. Texaco, Inc. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 1147, 1169 [252 Cal.Rptr. 221, 
762 P.2d 385]; cf.  Bank of the West v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1260 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545] 
[describing section 17200 as part of ""Unfair Business Practices Act""].) "
453,," To avoid this confusion of terms we will adopt our own nomenclature for the affected statutes. Thus we refer to Insurance Code 
sections 790 through 790.10 as the Unfair Insurance Practices Act (UIPA), Business and Professions Code sections 17000 
through 17101 as the Unfair Business Practices Act (UBPA), and Business and Professions Code sections 17200 through 
17208 as the Unfair Competition Act (UCA). "
454,3," HN6[
]  Insurance Code section 790.09 provides: ""No order to cease and desist issued under this article directed to any person or subsequent administrative or judicial proceeding to enforce the same shall in any way relieve or absolve such person 
from any administrative action against the license or certificate of such person, civil liability or criminal penalty under the laws of 
this State arising out of the methods, acts or practices found unfair or deceptive."""
454,4," ""§ 790.11. The powers vested in the commissioner in this article shall be additional to any other powers to enforce any 
penalties, fines or forfeitures authorized by law with respect to the methods, acts and practices hereby declared to be unfair or 
deceptive."" (Assem. Bill No. 1530 (1959 Reg. Sess.), § 1; see now Ins. Code, § 790.08.)"
454,5," ""No order of the Commissioner under this Act or order of a court to enforce the same shall in any way relieve or absolve any 
person affected by such order from any liability under any other laws of this state."" (Exhibit B to Rep. of Joint Com. on Fed. 
Legislation etc. (Jan. 24, 1947), § 8(d); Proceedings, 78th Ann. Sess., NAIC (1947), p. 398.) "
455,6," In a memorandum to the Governor, the Chief Assistant Insurance Commissioner indicated that the UIPA had been enacted in 
all but one other state and that it was expected to add little if anything to California law. He concluded, ""The Department is 
neither opposed to nor an advocate for this Bill. We know of nothing in the Bill which is detrimental to the public interest."" (J. 
Thomas, Mem. from Dept. of Ins. to Hon. Edmund G. Brown (Jun. 30, 1959), pp. 1-2; exhibit 1 to request for judicial notice filed 
Sept. 20, 1991, in A055038.) A few years later, the same author wrote that the Model Act ""had only a psychological application to states, such as New York 
and California[,] which already had extensive laws regulating practically every phase of the business . . .. [P] California and some 
of the other active states hesitated [to adopt the act] because it was difficult to justify the expense and time expenditure of 
enacting and having in the books an Act which, for all practical purposes, was unnecessary."" (J. Thomas, Interdepartmental 
Mem. (May 17, 1960), pp. 1-2; exhibit 3 to request for judicial notice filed Sept. 20, 1991, in A055038.)"
455,7," HN10[
] Statutes are also presumed to be consistent with the common law. ( Dry Creek Valley Assn., Inc. v. Board of Supervisors (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 839, 844 [135 Cal.Rptr. 726]; see Rojo v. Kliger (1990) 52 Cal.3d 65, 75 [276 Cal.Rptr. 130, "
456,801," P.2d 373]; Lacher v. Superior Court (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 1038, 1050 [281 Cal.Rptr. 640], review den.; cf.  I.E. Associates 
v. Safeco Title Ins. Co. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 281, 285 [216 Cal.Rptr. 438, 702 P.2d 596].) In this regard, we observe that plaintiff's 
antitrust claims have their roots in common law. (See Speegle v. Board of Fire Underwriters, supra, 29 Cal.2d at pp. 44, 45, 46.)"
456,8," ""HN14[
] The purpose of this article is to regulate trade practices in the business of insurance in accordance with the intent of 
Congress as expressed in the Act of Congress of March 9, 1945 (Public Law 15, Seventy-ninth Congress), by defining, or 
providing for the determination of, all such practices in this State which constitute unfair methods of competition or unfair or 
deceptive acts or practices and by prohibiting the trade practices so defined or determined."" ( Ins. Code, § 790.) "
457,9," Amici California Chamber of Commerce et al., describe the UIPA as ""answer[ing] a concern expressed by the California 
Supreme Court"" in Speegle v. Board of Fire Underwriters, supra, 29 Cal.2d 34, 45. It is true that the court noted the absence of 
""special legislation"" in this state against combinations in restraint of the insurance trade. But the only ""concern"" expressed in the 
cited passage is the potential effect of denying enforcement of the Cartwright Act in the insurance business. Certainly the court 
had no intention of prognosticating upon the hypothetical preemptive effect of statutes which did not then exist."
457,10," For example: ""We are persuaded . . . that appellants' vague and conclusionary pleadings fail to allege facts which might 
reasonably be construed to reveal a wrongful combination."" ( Chicago Title Ins. Co. v. Great Western Financial Corp., supra, 69 
Cal.2d at p. 315.) ""[T]he factual allegations, as illustrated, fail in each instance to support the charge. Just as the earlier counts state facts 
insufficient to establish proscribed conduct on the parts of the alleged actors and thus cannot reach their purported conspirators, 
so the final counts charging antitrust infringements fall for similar reasons."" (69 Cal.2d at p. 323, brackets original.) ""The allegation of boycott cannot be supported in this instance because everyone has the unrestricted right to select customers 
and sources of supply."" (69 Cal.2d at p. 324.)"
457,11," ""We must determine . . . whether the superior court has jurisdiction to entertain an action based upon appellants' theories, or 
any of them, and, if so, whether appellants have stated a cause of action against any of the various named defendants. The "
458,," latter finding, which is determinative, is in the negative."" ( Chicago Title Ins. Co. v. Great Western Financial Corp., supra, 69 
Cal.2d at p. 313, italics added.)"
458,12," Concerning our use of the term ""Unfair Business Practices Act,"" see footnote 2, ante. "
459,13," Apparently failing to discover this solid edifice of adverse sister-state authority, defendants cite only Chick's Auto Body v. State 
Farm etc. (1979) 168 N.J.Super. 68 [401 A.2d 722], affd.  (1980) 176 N.J.Super. 320 [423 A.2d 311]. That case is patently 
inapposite because it rests on an express exemption from that state's antitrust laws for the activities of insurers ""to the extent 
that such activities are subject to regulation by the Commissioner of Insurance."" (, 401 A.2d at p. 724, citing N.J. Stats. Ann. § 
56:9-5, subd. (b)(4).) We can find no fault with the court's analysis. Nor can we find any guidance in it, for this state has no such 
statute. "
466,1," The Court reduced the maximum hourly rate to $ 350.00, resulting in a reduction in the total fee award of $ 10,000.00. "
470,1," Includes actual time spent through February 25, 1994 plus additional time as follows: 35 for myself estimated to be spent in 
connection with completing the briefs in support of the settlement, travel to, preparation for and attendance at the settlement 
hearing scheduled for March 7, 1994; 45 hours for A. Stock estimated to be spent in connection with completing the briefs in 
support of the settlement; and 30 hours for N.L. Vernick, the settlement coordinator of Berger & Montague, P.C., estimated to be 
spent in connection with responding to shareholder inquiries and communications with the accountants assisting in settlement 
administration."
470,2," Includes estimated travel expenses in the amount of $ 915 for myself for travel to and attendance at the settlement hearing 
scheduled for March 7, 1994 and estimated additional miscellaneous expenses (photocopying, telephone, overnight mail 
service) of $ 250.00. "
471,1," Includes actual time spent through February 25, 1994 plus additional time as follows: 35 hours for S.R. Savett estimated to be

settlement hearing scheduled for March 7, 1994; 45 hours for A. Stock estimated to be spent in connection with completing the 
briefs in support of the settlement; and 30 hours for N. L. Vernick, the settlement coordinator of Berger & Montague, P.C., 
estimated to be spent in connection with responding to shareholder inquiries and communications with the accountants assisting 
in settlement administration. "
472,1," Unless otherwise indicated, all cases mentioned are securities class or derivative actions. "
551,1," It is alleged by Dr. Schueller that Dr. Garcia was carrying a weapon and ""pulled it"" on Dr. Schueller during this confrontation."
551,2, Dr. Garcia was also suspended and subsequently reinstated. 
554,3," Defendants note that although the individual defendants in this case were not parties to the previous state court action, 
defendants argue that the doctrines still apply because the other defendants were in privity with the Ashley Memorial Hospital. "
555,4," Defendants also contend that count four of plaintiff's complaint, brought against only Ashley Memorial Hospital, asserting that 
the hospital violated the HCQIA, fails to state a claim for which relief can be granted because the HCQIA does not provide for an "
556,," independent, private cause of action. Defendants contend that the HCQIA merely provides for immunity from suit and therefore 
count four should be dismissed. plaintiff argues that count four should not be dismissed because plaintiff properly and 
adequately has pled pendent state law claims of interference with a business or economic enterprise. In their reply, defendants 
contend that a plain reading of count four of plaintiff's complaint fails to state a claim for interference with business expectancies 
or contractual relationships as plaintiff has argued, again contending that this count should be dismissed. The court agrees that count four should be dismissed. HN11[
] The HCQIA provides only for limited immunity from civil 
damages incurred as the result of professional peer review action and does not provide for an independent, private right of 
action. The court also finds the complaint deficient of any state law claims for interference with a business or economic 
enterprise. Count four is entitled ""Schueller v. AMH     Suspension of Privileges violation of Health Care Quality Improvement Act 
    Denial of Due Process"" and no where within the six paragraphs of count four does plaintiff allege a claim under state law or 
even hint at alleging any claim other than one under the HCQIA. Accordingly, count four is dismissed for failure to state a claim 
against Ashley Memorial Hospital for which relief can be granted. "
557,5, See 42 U.S.C. § 11111.
557,6," HN12[
] ""Professional review action"" is defined as ""an action or recommendation of a professional review body which is taken 
or made in the conduct of a professional review activity, which is based on the competence or professional conduct of an 
individual physician (which conduct affects or could affect adversely the health or welfare of a patient or patients), and which 
affects (or may affect) adversely the clinical privileges, or membership in a professional society, of the physician. Such term 
includes a formal decision of a professional review body not to take an action or make a recommendation described in the 
previous sentence and also includes professional review activities relating to a professional review action."" 42 U.S.C. § 
11151(9)."
557,7," HN13[
] ""Professional review body"" is defined as ""a health care entity and the governing body or any committee of a health 
care entity which conducts professional review activity, and includes any committee of the medical staff of such an entity when 
assisting the governing body is a professional review activity."" 42 U.S.C. § 11151(11). "

] The immunity available is limited to protection from ""damages under any law of the United States or of any State,"" excepting any civil rights proceedings. 42 U.S.C. § 11111(a)(1). "
561,9," Defendants make a similar argument under the equitable doctrine of laches, contending that plaintiff's claims are barred even if 
the applicable statute of limitations has not expired. Based upon the rulings contained herein, the court also finds it unnecessary 
to delve into any substantive discussion with respect to the doctrine of laches and summary judgment based upon laches is 
hereby denied. "
576,1," This section does allow supplementation of the terms of the agreement by evidence of course of dealing. However, as 
discussed below, course of dealing is only admissible as evidence of modification to the extent that it is consistent with the 
written terms of the contract, and not to contradict contractual terms. See Part (ii) below."
576,2," Although, as noted above, in this case such agreements do violate the express ""written modification-only"" clause of this 
contract as well as Iowa law. "
579,3," As the Potti court stated, ""interpretation of written contract terms is a matter of law for initial determination by the court. . . . it is 
only when the relevant language is ambiguous that the job of interpretation is turned over to the fact finder . . . and the 
determination whether a contract is ambiguous is made as a matter of law by the court."" 938 F.2d at 647 (citations omitted). "

contract applies to a fixed quantity of 5,000 bushels of soybeans. In overly simplified terms, a long position in soybean futures is 
a position to buy soybeans for delivery at a designated future time at the agreed upon price. On the other hand, a short position 
in soybean futures is a position to sell soybeans at the agreed upon price for delivery at a designated future time. For example, a 
long position in 4,000 contracts reflects a position to buy 20 million bushels of soybeans. Because of the ability to offset 
positions, actual delivery is a rare event. For a more comprehensive discussion of the various components of commodities 
markets and futures contracts, see Philip M. Johnson & Thomas L. Hazen, I Commodities Regulation §§ 1.00-1.19, at 1-84 (2d 
ed. 1989); see also Chicago Mercantile Exch. v. SEC, 883 F.2d 537, 542-43 (7th Cir. 1989) (discussing futures contract 
trading), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 936, 110 S. Ct. 3214, 110 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1990); Leist v. Simplot, 638 F.2d 283, 286-88 (2d Cir. 
1980) (same), aff'd sub nom., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U.S. 353, 72 L. Ed. 2d 182, 102 S. Ct. 
1825 (1982); William F. Sharpe & Gordon J. Alexander, Investments, ch. 5, at 594-628 (4th ed. 1990) (same). "
587,2," Plaintiffs are correct to the extent that had Defendants brought only a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), 
""general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant's conduct may suffice, for on a motion to dismiss we 'presume 
that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.'"" Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 
119 L. Ed. 2d 351, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 2137 (1992) (quoting Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. 871, 889, 111 L. Ed. 2d 
695, 110 S. Ct. 3177 (1990))."
587,3," Defendants correctly note the ample authorities in support of this proposition. See, e.g., NAACP v. American Family Mut. Ins. 
Co., 978 F.2d 287, 293 (7th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 124 L. Ed. 2d 247, 113 S. Ct. 2335 (1993); Schaefer v. Transportation 
Media, Inc., 859 F.2d 1251, 1253-54 (7th Cir. 1987) (""when the party moving for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) challenges the 
factual basis for jurisdiction, the nonmoving party (i.e., the plaintiff) must submit affidavits and other relevant evidence to resolve 
the factual dispute regarding the court's jurisdiction""); Sprague v. King, 825 F. Supp. 1324, 1329 (N.D. Ill. 1993) (""Once 
questioned, it is plaintiff's burden to establish that all jurisdictional requirements have been satisfied.""). "
588,4," The last day of trading for July 1989 futures was July 20, 1989."
588,5," Defendants do not cite to any material that details when or how this communication between the CFTC and the CBOT 
occurred. Our review of the Hearing indicates that the CFTC and CBOT were in frequent contact throughout this period. We also 
note that a ""Chronology of Events"" prepared by CFTC staff indicates that the Business Conduct Committee had already 
recommended taking emergency action prior to the CFTC's decision to revoke the Ferruzzi hedge exemption. Finally, the Court 
finds that the present record as a whole provides only a cursory view into the circumstances and timing of the CFTC action. "
589,6," We do not find Michigan Consol. Gas v. Energy Regulatory Admin., 281 U.S. App. D.C. 277, 889 F.2d 1110, 1111-12 (D.C. 
Cir. 1989), on point. Though the courts finds that a plaintiff challenging an administrative agency's action lacks standing to obtain 
judicial review and refers to the lack of an injury fairly traceable to the agency's action, it does so in the context of standing under 
§ 19(b) of the National Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. § 717r(b). Id. "
590,7," Defendants list of imponderable include the whether, availability of competing soybeans from other regions and other nations, 
transport costs to ship grains, purchasing needs of any particular buyer, the quality and grade of the soybeans, storage costs 
incurred by farmers holding soybeans for later sale, and prices set by processors. "
591,8," In constrast to the issue of Article III standing which was not mentioned, the Seventh Circuit noted that on remand this Court 
might ""find it profitable to examine whether the AAM, whose members participated in the cash market, has standing under § 4 of 
the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15, to bring an antitrust suit challenging anticompetitive practices in the futures market."" 977 F.2d at 
1167. That issue is now squarely joined before this Court. Unlike our discussion of Article III standing, our resolution of this issue 
will depend on the allegations of the Complaint and we will not consider matters outside of those allegations. "
595,9," Though not mentioned by either party, this case is perhaps further complicated by the absence of a potential party, Ferruzzi, 
which plays a central role in this saga. As the Hearing testimony indicates, the CFTC and the CBOT were concerned that 
Ferruzzi was attempting a squeeze that could and conceivably did contribute to the higher futures prices that allegedly prevailed 
prior to the issuance of the Resolution. As one court observed about the antitrust claims of traders in the silver futures market, 
""the magnitude of plaintiff's losses, if not the very potential for those losses, was directly determined by the actions allegedly 
taken by the non-exchange defendants to boost the price of silver futures."" Grosser v. Commodity Exchange, Inc., 639 F. Supp. 
1293, 1319 (S.D.N.Y. 1986), aff'd, 859 F.2d 148 (2d Cir. 1988). Thus, it appears quite clear that the market conditions both 
before and after the issuance of the Resolution are not only relevant but essential to analyzing the potential impact of the 
Resolution on the soybean futures market. "
596,10," Lest their be any doubt, even had we found that those Plaintiffs who refrained from selling had standing under Article III, our 
analysis and conclusion with respect to that class of Plaintiffs would not differ. In fact, the class of Plaintiffs who refrained from 
selling soybeans is one step further down the already attenuated causal chain and the damage assessment would have an 
added level of difficulty for these Plaintiffs. "
600,1," This court previously granted defendant Local 196's motion to dismiss Count III. Ehredt Underground, Inc. v. Commonwealth 
Edison Co., 830 F. Supp. 1083 (N.D. Ill. 1993). "
607,2," We will address the evidence with respect to alleged co-conspirators Local 196, Edison, Edison employees and Trench-It. The 
record is devoid of any evidence implicating the International and Local 336 in the conspiracy."
607,3," We note, however, that although this evidence may evince a connection between Edison and Local 196, it does not show that 
Local 196 had any interest in forcing Ehredt out of business. In fact, Eastwood's statements could be more easily read to support 
the opposite proposition, because Eastwood stated that the Edison official was helping to get contractors into the union. 
Logically, a union does not recruit members only to effectuate their unemployment by its ""ruinous"" collective bargaining 
agreement."
607,4," The record reveals that Local 196's campaign to recruit Ehredt was undertaken at the urging of Daniel Rosenmayer, president 
of Trench-It. This fact does not help Ehredt's case. As stated above, Trench-It's and Local 196's goals in pressuring Ehredt to 
switch unions were distinct. Trench-It wanted Ehredt to pay higher wages so it could compete with Ehredt for the URD contract, 
while Local 196 wanted Ehredt's membership. In order to find an antitrust conspiracy with a labor union based on a collective 
bargaining agreement, the goal between co-conspirators must be a common one. Mid-America Regional Bargaining Assn. v. 
Will County Carpenters Dist. Council, 675 F.2d 881, 889 (7th Cir. 1982). "
609,5," In addition, we disagree that Local 196 was the only acceptable union to Edison. The remarks made by Douglas Hill 
concerning the desirability of Local 196 over Local 150 is not necessarily indicative of Edison's decision whether Local 150 
would be an acceptable union. Shamblin, not Hill, made decisions regarding union affiliation. Furthermore, Local 336 had been 
accepted by Edison. The union itself, not Edison, determined that Ehredt must be represented by Local 196. "
610,6," The record also indicates that Frank King, Edison's area foreman for the Crystal Lake District, was likely a participant in the 
conspiracy. In the presence of Douglas Hill, King told Ken Ehredt that he had to ""pay the piper."" Ehredt alleges that this 
statement intimated to him that he had to pay a kickback. "
612,7," Edison states that ""it appears that the Magistrate Judge's Report is also intended to be a ruling on Edison's Motion in Limine . . 
. to exclude legal theories."" This is not the case; Edison's Motion in Limine was not decided by the Magistrate Judge and is still 
pending before the court. "
626,1," Electron power tubes are vacuum or gas-filled electron tubes capable of handling at least 25 watts of power; they are used to 
amplify and control electrical signals in a variety of industrial, communication and scientific applications such as heating, 
dielectric sealing, and radio and television broadcasting where current or voltage amplification is required. (Second Amended 
Complaint (hereafter ""Complaint II"") P 2.)"
626,2," Defendant Richardson Electronics, Ltd. has also moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint. That motion was 
not referred to this court and is not addressed in this Report."
626,3," Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint also lists as a named plaintiff CCA Electronics, Inc. (""CCA""), a Georgia manufacturer of 
radio transmitters containing electron power tubes. CCA has subsequently withdrawn from the suit. "
627,4," Plaintiffs attached to Complaint II copies of the VASCO Joint Venture Agreement (Exhibit A) and a related Distributor-
Requirements Agreement executed between Varian and REL (Exhibit B). Pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 10(c), both agreements 
are made a part of the complaint."
627,5," As explained in the August 28, 1992 Report and Recommendation, (R & R, at 9), HN1[
] horizontal agreements are those 
among parties at the same level of the distribution chain."
627,6," Although the complaint only alleged that Varian is a manufacturer of electron power tubes, Judge Nordberg found that the 
language of the joint venture agreement clearly implied that Varian is a distributor as well. Panache, 1993-1 Trade Cas. (CCH), 
at 69,816 n.1. "
628,7," HN6[
] A ""market"" is the set of suppliers to which a set of customers can turn for their requirements of a particular product at 
existing or slightly higher prices.  F.T.C. v. Elders Grain, 868 F.2d at 907 (citing Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 
U.S. 320, 5 L. Ed. 2d 580, 81 S. Ct. 623 (1961)). A particular supplier's ""market share"" is that supplier's fraction of output.  
United States v. Rockford Memorial Corp., 898 F.2d 1278, 1283 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 920, 112 L. Ed. 2d 249, 111 S. 
Ct. 295 (1990). ""The higher the aggregate market share of a small number of suppliers, the easier it is for them to increase 
prices above the competitive level without losing so much business to other suppliers as to make the price increase unprofitable; 
this is the power we call market power."" Id. "
629,8," Surplus tubes and tube carcasses are ""broken, damaged, defective, spent, used, or obsolete electron power tubes"" of the 
types that can be rebuilt or reconditioned and then sold in competition with new electron power tubes. (Complaint II P 50.) Such 
surplus tubes and carcasses are sometimes referred to as ""dud tubes"" or simply ""duds."" "
630,9," On October 7, 1991, REL had pleaded guilty to a felony violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, pursuant to a 
criminal Information charging REL with the same conduct as that charged Varian. United States v. Varian Assocs., Inc., No. 91 C 
6211, (N.D. Ill. April 14, 1992) (Lindberg, J.) (granting plaintiffs motion for final judgment)."
630,10," Specifically, VASCO entered into agreements with Jing Guang Electrical Manufactory, China National Electronics Export and 
Import Corporation, and China National Electronics Devices Corporation. (Complaint P 58). "
632,11," Article VIII(11) of the JV Agreement provides: So long as JV is a distributor of products pursuant to the [DR] Agreement attached hereto, Varian shall continue to (a) 
make direct sales of Products to local, state and federal governmental entities as provided in Exhibit A attached hereto and 
subject to the $ 5000 order limitation provided in Exhibit A, (b) continue and expand its OEM [original equipment 
manufacturer] arrangements as provided in Exhibit A attached hereto and subject to the $ 5000 order limitation provided in 
Exhibit A, and (c) continue to make direct internal sales of Products to Varian divisions and subsidiaries."
632,12, Exhibit A describes markets and products covered by the JV agreement.
632,13," The Supreme Court has explained the distinction between interbrand and intrabrand competition in these terms: HN12[
] Interbrand competition is the competition among the manufacturers of the same generic product -- television sets 
in this case -- and is the primary concern of antitrust law. The extreme example of a deficiency of interbrand competition is 
monopoly, where there is only one manufacturer. In contrast, intrabrand competition is the competition between the 
distributors -- wholesale or retail -- of the product of a particular manufacturer. Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 52 n.19, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977). "
633,14, Articles VIII(6) and VIII(7) provide:
633,6," . As soon as possible after the execution of this Agreement, JV [VASCO Joint Venture] shall enter into distributor 
relationships with manufacturers other than Varian and pursuant to agreements approved by the JV Management 
Committee for the distribution in Territories of Other Products. Other Products sold to JV pursuant to such agreements shall 
be purchased at prices which are subject to approval by the JV Management Committee."
633,7," . In addition to the activities described in this Article VIII, JV anticipates entering into transactions and arrangements with 
tube manufacturers other than Varian to purchase or to have manufactured piece parts and subassemblies for power grid 
tubes or finished goods with Varian supervision. In this regard and as a condition to the close of this Agreement, 
Richardson shall assign to the JV any and all rights and any and all obligations it has or may have in the future with 
manufacturers from the People's Republic of China (""PRC"") as well as elsewhere to purchase such piece parts, 
subassemblies or finished goods . . . and the JV shall then sell to Varian such piece parts and subassemblies . . . . (emphasis added). ""Other Products"" is defined in Exhibit B to the JV Agreement as ""all products that are interchangeable with 
those products that Varian has granted exclusive distribution rights to."""
633,15," Plaintiffs insist, more precisely in their opposition brief than in their Second Amended Complaint, that: REL and Varian agreed not only that REL would not sell Varian tubes to ""restricted"" accounts, but that REL would not sell 
any other competing tubes to those restricted accounts. In turn, Varian bound itself to sell electron power tubes and any 
competing tubes made by other manufacturers only to VASCO, which in turn sold only to REL, thereby protecting REL from 
any possible competition from Varian in the sale of both Varian and non-Varian tubes. REL also assigned all of its current 
and future distribution and supply agreements with other manufacturers to VASCO, further assuring Varian control over any 
possible competition from REL's distribution of those competitors' lines. (Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant Varian Associates' Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint 
(hereinafter ""Plaintiffs' Opposition""), at 9-10) (footnote omitted) (citing Complaint II P 44; JV Agreement, Art. VIII PP 6-7.) "
634,16," Moreover, Varian's reliance on NCAA is misplaced. At issue in that case was the relevance of reasonably substitutable 
products to a definition of the relevant market and a determination of the defendant's market power.  NCAA, 468 U.S. at 111. 
Because HN16[
] the definition of a relevant market is a question of fact, Clark Equip. Co. v. Lift Parts Mfg. Co., No. 82- C-
4585, 1990 WL 8690, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 22, 1990), the Court's discussion of the correct test for its determination is of limited 
utility here."
634,17," Although Varian only considered the Amperex, Philips, and Machlett acquisitions in its motion in this regard, Plaintiffs also 
attributed the acquisition of Westinghouse Electric Corporation (""Westinghouse"") directly to Varian's alleged collusive behavior. 
(Complaint II P 57; but see id. P 56(j) (where Plaintiffs omit reference to Varian).) The court will refrain from any discussion of 
Westinghouse as the parties' briefs make no reference to this particular acquisition. "
637,18," Although the court accepts Varian's first argument -- that Plaintiffs' allegation concerning the exclusive marketing 
arrangements with Chinese agencies is insufficient for the purpose of pleading -- Varian's second is less persuasive. Varian 
contends that under Plaintiffs' definition of the relevant geographic market as the United States, ""there would have been no 
competition from foreign imports anyway."" (Varian's Memorandum, at 10). As Plaintiffs point out, however, HN25[
] the 
relevant geographic market defines the area where goods are bought and sold, not where goods are made. Thus, foreign-made 
electron power tubes exported to the United States are part of the U.S. geographic market. "
638,19," Plaintiffs assert that ""power grid tubes constituted most of the electron power tubes which were subject of the VASCO 
Agreements and related transactions."" (Complaint II P 71). "
639,20," Moreover, in this instance, Varian's reliance on Banks is misplaced. At issue in Banks, 977 F.2d at 1087-88, was whether 
defendant NCAA's no-draft rule restrained trade in an identifiable market. The Seventh Circuit concluded that although the rule 
merely served as NCAA's eligibility requirement, plaintiff ""could have alleged the manner in which the no-draft and no-agent 
rules have an anti-competitive impact on a relevant market,"" had he properly identified ""college football labor"" as the relevant 
market. Id. at 1090-91. In contrast, in this case, Plaintiffs have alleged a restraint of trade in the market for electron power tubes 
by pleading that Defendants' collection program reduced competition for such tubes and thereby increased prices for such 
tubes."
639,21," As this court noted in its earlier Report and Recommendation, however, the charges to which Varian pleaded guilty are 
significantly narrower than Plaintiffs' allegations here. (R & R, at 39-42). Thus, although HN27[
] Section 5(a) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 16(a), affords private plaintiffs the right to use guilty pleas as all-purpose admissions in civil antitrust actions, 
Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co., 323 F.2d 412, 415 (7th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 939, 11 L. Ed. 
2d 659, 84 S. Ct. 794 (1964), that is, as prima facie evidence of an antitrust violation, the court reminds Plaintiffs that Varian's 
guilty plea provides little support for their broad allegations here. "
642,22," The Seventh Circuit has noted that HN35[
] judicial interpretations of the standards for judging the lawfulness of transactions under section 7 of the Clayton Act and under section 1 of the Sherman Act have ""converged."" United States v. 
Rockford Memorial Corp., 898 F.2d 1278, 1281-82 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 920, 112 L. Ed. 2d 249, 111 S. Ct. 295 
(1990)."
642,23," HN36[
] The Supreme Court has described the basic implications of any joint venture on competition in these terms: The joint venture . . . is the chosen competitive instrument of two or more corporations previously acting independently and 
usually competitively with one another. The result is a ""triumvirate of associated corporations."" If the parent companies are 
in competition, or might compete absent the joint venture, it may be assumed that neither will compete with the progeny in 
its line of commerce. Inevitably, the operations of the joint venture will be frozen to those lines of commerce which will not 
bring it into competition with the parents, and the latter, by the same token will be foreclosed from the joint venture's market. Penn-Olin, 378 U.S. at 169."
642,24," HN37[
] The complete list of the Court's recommended criteria includes: The number and power of the competitors in the relevant market; the background of their growth; the power of the joint 
venturers; the relationship of their lines of commerce; the competition existing between them and the power of each in 
dealing with the competitors of the other; the setting in which the joint venture was created; the reasons and necessity for 
its existence; the joint venture's line of commerce and the relationship thereof to that of its parents; the adaptability of its 
line of commerce to non-competitive practices; the potential power of the joint venture in the relevant market; an appraisal 
of what the competition in the relevant market would have been if one of the joint venturers had entered it alone instead of 
through [the joint venture]; the effect, in the event of this occurrence, of the other joint venturer's potential competition; and 
such other factors as might indicate potential risk to competition in the relevant market. Id. at 177. "
650,1," Counts I and II allege a horizontal conspiracy to fix prices, divide markets, exclude competition, coerce TE through exclusive 
contracts, in violation of 15 U.S.C. § 1. Counts III and IV claim the defendants entered into vertical conspiracies with cable 
system operators to restrain trade and coerce TE's clients, also in violation of 15 U.S.C. § 1. Count V claims the defendants 
monopolized access to local cable systems, in violation of 15 U.S.C. § 2. Counts VI and VII assert that the preceding actions 
constitute violations of the Virginia antitrust statutes, Va. Code § 59.1-9.5, -9.6, and business conspiracy statutes, Va. Code § 
18.2-499, -500. Count VIII claims the defendants interfered with TE's business relations. Finally, the remaining counts allege that 
the defendants made defamatory statements about TE in violation of state law and Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 
1125. Although TE also claimed at the summary judgment stage that it made a ""tying"" claim in its Amended Complaint, the pleading 
obviously does not give notice of such a claim. "
652,2," An ""interconnect"" is a group of cable systems located within a given geographic area that have entered into an arrangement 
enabling advertisers to purchase advertising time on the entire group of systems in one purchase. (Defts. Mem. 7, at note 3.)"
652,3," The defendants claim that ""exclusive sales agent arrangements are necessary to support defendants' considerable 
investments in market and demographic research and in technological innovations that facilitate the actual placement of spot 
cable advertising."" (Defts. Mem. 17.) "
653,4," The parties have referred to the spot cable contracts as ""exclusive dealing"" contracts. Such a categorization is only partly 
accurate. An ""exclusive dealing"" contract is ""an agreement by a distributor to refrain from dealing in goods of a competitor."" ABA 
Antitrust Section, Antitrust Law Developments, 117 n.631 (3d ed. 1992). On the other hand, ""an exclusive distributorship 
typically provides a distributor with the right to be the exclusive outlet for a manufacturer's products or services in a given 
geographic area. It restricts the manufacturer from competing with a distributor by preventing the manufacturer from establishing 
its own sales outlet in the area as well as from appointing or selling to other distributors located in the area."" Id. at 117; see also 
Steuer, Richard M., Exclusive Dealing in Distribution, 69 Cornell L. Rev. 101, 102 n.4 (1983) (""Exclusive [distributorships] do not 
in themselves limit the distributors, although they are frequently coupled with territorial restraints to keep the dealers out of each 
other's exclusive territories.""). The contracts at issue in this case are between cable systems and cable rep firms in which the systems appoint the rep firms as 
exclusive representatives for national and regional advertising directed to the cable systems' respective geographic markets. 
Regardless of which label is used, the ultimate question is whether the contracts unreasonably restrain competition. See, e.g., 
Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery and Printing Co., 472 U.S. 284, 289, 86 L. Ed. 2d 202, 105 S. Ct. 
2613 (1985) (every commercial agreement restrains trade; key is whether restraint is reasonable). However, the term ""exclusive distributorship"" best describes the arrangements in this case, because the rep firms commonly act 
as a substitute or extension of the cable systems' internal sales staffs. "
654,5," In the present case, Thompson Everett has not offered any evidence that the product market should be confined to the ""spot 
cable"" industry instead of the advertising industry. It is clear that spot cable competes with broadcast television for advertising 
dollars, but most courts allow the fact-finder to determine the relevant market. See Storer Cable Communications v. City of 
Montgomery, 826 F. Supp. 1338 (M.D. Ala. 1993) (relevant market usually determined only after fact-finding has been 
conducted). For summary judgment purposes, the Court will consider the effect of exclusive contracts on the narrow spot cable 
market as well. "
656,6," It is unclear whether TE would suffer at all from artificially high prices, because its commissions would increase as a direct 
consequence."
656,7," This does not include TE. It has chosen not to compete for those contracts because of the conflict of interest those 
arrangements would create with its advertiser clients. (Venhuizen Tr. 364-65.)"
656,8," TE argues, in the alternative, that its claims should survive summary judgment even if it is deemed not to compete with the 
defendants, citing Engine Specialties, Inc. v. Bombardier, Ltd., 605 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1979), cert. denied 446 U.S. 983, 64 L. Ed. 
2d 839, 100 S. Ct. 2964 (1980). However, Engine Specialties cannot rescue TE's claims. The plaintiff in that case actually 
competed with the defendant pursuant to its own exclusive distributorship contract. See id. at 13. "
657,9," Justice Brandeis stated the rule of reason this way in Board of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 62 L. Ed. 683, 38 S. Ct. 
242 (1918): The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes 
competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question the court must 
ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the 
restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the evil 
believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant 
facts. Id. at 238."
657,10," As Justice Black stated: There are certain agreements or practices which because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any 
redeeming virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the 
precise harm they have caused or the business excuse for their use. This principle of per se unreasonableness not only 
makes the type of restraints which are proscribed by the Sherman Act more certain to the benefit of everyone concerned, 
but it also avoids the necessity for an incredibly complicated and prolonged economic investigation into the entire history of 
the industry involved, as well as related industries, in an effort to determine at large whether a particular restraint has been 
unreasonable -- an inquiry so often wholly fruitless when undertaken. Northern Pac. Ry. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545, 78 S. Ct. 514 (1958)."
657,11," The contracts between the cable operators and the representative firms create an agency relationship. Under the intra-
corporate conspiracy doctrine, a corporation cannot conspire with its own agents. See Buschi v. Kirven, 775 F.2d 1240, 1241-
552 (4th Cir. 1985). "
659,12," Thus, summary judgment also will be granted in favor of the defendants on TE's monopolization claim under Section 2 of the 
Sherman Act, and on its Virginia antitrust claims. See White v. Rockingham Radiologists, Ltd., 820 F.2d 98, 105 (4th Cir. 1987) 
(plaintiff must show jury could find defendant had no valid business reason or concern for efficiency); Satellite Television, 714 
F.2d at 358 n.13 (reasoning applicable to Sherman Act claims governs Virginia antitrust statutes). For the same reasons, 
summary judgment will be granted for the defendants on the Virginia business conspiracy claims. Such claims require proof that 
the conspiracy had the purpose of ""willfully and maliciously injuring"" the plaintiff in his business, which could not be proved at

673,3," In ordering the discovery of this report we find ourselves in agreement with Judge Bertelsman, in the Eastern District of 
Kentucky. Commonwealth v. Louis Trauth Dairy, Inc., No. 92-50 slip op. (E.D. Ky., June 25, 1992). "
679,1," Two Counts (8 and 13) alleging price-fixing practices had been dismissed on the Defendants' motion for summary judgment. In 
this memorandum, the Counts are referred to by their original numbers. "
681,2," The Court addresses Counts 2 and 3, tortious interference with contractual or prospective business relations, in its discussion 
of the punitive damages award. "
682,3," The same result applies under the federal or state antitrust statutes. HN7[
] Section 11-204(a)(1) of the Maryland Antitrust Act indicates that courts are to be ""guided by the interpretation given by the federal courts to the various federal statutes dealing with 
the same or similar matters."" Md. Code Ann. Com. Law II § 11-204(a)(1) (1990 Repl. Vol.)."
682,4," In this instance, while the PGA did approve the contract, it was Dan Daniels, in his capacity as PGA general counsel, who 
approved the contract immediately prior to resigning from the PGA to go to Seabury. "
683,5," Seabury points to the fact that at one point the MAPGA refused PGA's request for information because the information sought 
was proprietary to the MAPGA. See Defs.' Ex. 73. There were also allegations that the MAPGA was denied a request to view 
PGA's exhibitor waiting list because the waiting list was ""proprietary."" That a parent company would keep information from its 
subsidiary is not as troublesome to the Court as a subsidiary keeping information from the parent company; controlling 
information from the top down is consistent with a parent exercising control over a subsidiary."
683,6," Seabury presented evidence at trial that the PGA purchased the International Golf Show (""the West Coast Show"") from the 
Southern California section. While it is true that the PGA did not simply pay a token sum for the purchase of the Show, there 
were several unrebutted reasons offered by the PGA for pursuing the transaction: (1) to be fair to the Southern California section 
members, who had developed the Show and (2) to support the Section's programs which had become dependent on revenues 
from the Show. Even assuming that the PGA made the payment to purchase an asset from the section, the fact remains that the 
PGA always had ultimate control over the section, which could not function as a section independent of the PGA."
683,7," ""Recent discussions with GMDA indicate significant concerns about proliferation of Shows and lack of PGA involvement."" "
685,8," The PGA's exhibitor waiting list evidences manufacturers' and distributors' desire to participate in golf trade shows despite the 
fact that booth prices, which continued to increase every year, were thought to be ""very expensive."" Vincent Tr. at 62. Notably, 
both the PGA Orlando Show and the West Coast Show are able to maintain extensive waiting lists, despite complaints by 
exhibitors of ""price gouging."" Pl.'s Ex. 226. This evidence tends to show that pricing at golf trade shows is inelastic and that the 
booth prices charged by the PGA have no real effect upon demand, facts which support a finding of a relevant product market."
685,9," ""They're not really effective competitors, effective in the sense that they really don't provide the kind of competition to the large 
national and regional shows that the kind of competition that would cause those other shows to do -- to act differently because 
the sectional shows are around."""
685,10," For example, Dr. Martin opined that PGA rules limiting sectional shows to their boundaries meant that such shows ""really 
service the exhibitors that are . . . located within [those] boundaries and the employees that are located within the boundaries,"" 
and that sectional shows are therefore, much smaller operations. Martin Tr. at 19-20. Dr. Martin, however, referred to no 
evidence in support of his conclusion."
685,11," In fact, the only concrete evidence on this issue contradicts Dr. Martin. See Maxwell Tr. at 60 (testifying that would not be 
surprised if show conducted by the Pacific Northwest Section had just as many exhibitors and buyers of the East Coast Show), 
61 (stating that North and South Texas Show ""certainly draws very good attendance with respect to attendees and 
manufacturers.""). "
686,12," Plaintiff stated at argument on the Defendants' post-trial motion that the issue of whether or not the sectional shows and the 
West Coast Show should have been included is irrelevant, given that the PGA has market power even if these other shows are 
included. Plaintiff may be right, although it presented no evidence at argument to support such a bold and significant conclusion. 
Even so, the fact that Plaintiff submitted no evidence at trial on the size of these other shows or their ownership renders the jury 
verdict invalid because the jury did not have the opportunity to establish the PGA's market share in a market that included such 
shows. "
687,13," The Court does not agree with the Defendants' argument that Seabury would be entitled to only the lost profits of the cancelled 
1992 East Coast Show. The Defendants reason that the jury's verdict, if left intact, indicates Seabury was entitled to put on a 
MAPGA-sponsored show in Atlantic City. Then, according to the Defendants, Seabury could still produce the 1993-1995 golf 
trade shows and has simply abandoned the venture. The contractual relationship, however, has been fundamentally altered and 
the contract breached. Seabury is entitled to choose its remedy and is not now required to work with the breaching party."
687,14," In essence, under this method, Plaintiff's expert, Dr. Rey, arbitrarily subtracted certain expenses, but not others, from the 
gross revenues of the West Coast Show to come up with that show's ""direct profits."" The ratio between the price paid by the 
PGA for the West Coast Show and the Show's ""direct profits"" generated a multiplier, which Dr. Rey then applied to Seabury's 
""direct profits,"" calculated in the same fashion. Given Plaintiff's inability to explain why Dr. Rey left out certain expenses when 
calculating direct profits, it is apparent that Dr. Rey manipulated the calculations and in fact ""invented"" the concept of ""direct "
688,," profits"" in order to make Seabury, a corporation showing no net profits, and actually operating at a loss, look like it had a profit. 
The West Coast Show, no matter which way you calculated it, would always show a profit. Thus, the direct profits calculation 
produces a meaningless number."
688,15," At argument, Plaintiff's counsel could not provide a complete list of which expenses were taken into account in the calculation 
of Seabury's profit forecast and which were not. However, based on those expenses which Plaintiff's counsel conceded were not 
taken into consideration, it is apparent that the cash-flow analysis is fatally flawed."
688,16, The growth rate was also used in the discount cash-flow analysis.
688,17," See Maxwell Tr. at 53 (stating that the first six years of the West Coast Show gave it a ""fairly stable base"" and that there was 
""no question that [it] . . . became some of the foundation that has made [the West Coast Show] successful"")."
688,18," HN16[
] Under Maryland law, a plaintiff may use a ""yardstick"" measure of proving its damages, as long as its assumptions 
rest on adequate bases and there is a ""reasonable compatibility"" between the businesses. See Metrix Warehouse, Inc. v. 
Daimler-Benz Aktiengesellschaft, 828 F.2d 1033, 1044 n.21 (4th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1017 (1988)."
688,19," See, e.g., Handley v. Guasco, 165 Cal. App. 2d 703, 332 P.2d 354, 360 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1958) (""To base prospective 
profits of a business in a completely new location and city upon the experience of an old established business elsewhere would 
be highly speculative.""); Belcher v. Import Cars Ltd., 246 So. 2d 584, 587 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App.) (established car dealership not 
comparable to new car dealership), cert. denied, 252 So. 2d 801 (Fla. 1971); Evergreen Amusement Corp. v. Milstead, 206 Md. 
610, 112 A.2d 901, 904 (Md. 1955) (refusing to permit plaintiff to establish damages for start-up period by using profits that same 
business earned in later period); Plummer v. Fogley, 363 P.2d 238, 242 (Okla. 1961) (cannot compare experienced business to 
inexperienced business)."
688,20," Plaintiff claims in attempting to establish comparability that Seabury and the West Coast Show operating with comparable 
profits margins. However, in support of this claim, Plaintiff compares its ""direct profits"" from the 1991 East Coast Show, which as 
previously noted fail to take into account significant expenses, with the West Coast Show's actual profits. Seabury had no net 
profits from the 1991 Show, and in fact lost between $ 20,000 and $ 75,000 that year. It is thus clear that Plaintiff's claim 
regarding the comparability of the East and West Coast Shows' profit margins is incredible."
688,21," The Court also notes that using the multiple paid for the West Coast Show in its thirteenth year of operation would generate an 
inaccurate damage number. If usable at all, the multiple should have been discounted for one year given that the Seabury 
contract was only for five years and the multiple derived from the West Coast Show's thirteenth year is six years from the date 
from which calculation of the growth rate began. "
689,22," See, e.g., LaVay Corp. v. Dominion Federal Savings & Loan Ass'n, 830 F.2d 522, 529 (4th Cir. 1987) (""Damages may not be 
awarded . . . where an award would be based on an estimate of lost profits which is speculative."") (citing Restatement (Second) 
of Contracts § 352 (1979), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1065, 98 L. Ed. 2d 991, 108 S. Ct. 1027 (1988)."
689,23," See John D. Copanos & Sons v. McDade Rigging & Steel Erection Co., Inc., 43 Md. App. 204, 206, 403 A.2d 402, 404-05 
(1979); United States Life Ins. Co. v. Mechanics and Farmers Bank, 685 F.2d 887, 895-96 (4th Cir. 1982)."
689,24," Finally, although the jury's finding that the Defendants breached the Contract might permit an award in the amount of $ 1.00 as 
nominal compensatory damages, the Court's doubts concerning the propriety of setting damages by granting judgment as a 
matter of law compels it to exercise its discretion and deny Plaintiff nominal damages. If a $ 1.00 nominal damage award were to 
be viewed by the appellate court as a remittitur of damages, the Court would be required to offer Plaintiff the option of a new trial 
on damages. See Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Jacobson, 644 F. Supp. 1240, 1263 & n.16 (N.D. Ill. 1986) (setting 
aside compensatory damage award of $ 3 million and entering judgment in favor of plaintiff for $ 1.00 as nominal damages; 
however, offering option of remittitur/new trial should appellate court conclude that it is improper to set damages by granting 
JNOV), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 827 F.2d 1119 (7th Cir. 1987) (not addressing issue), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 993 (1988). 
Because Plaintiff has utterly failed to prove that it sustained any damage as a result of the Defendants' breach or the extent of 
any such damage, a new trial on damages would be fruitless. Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff's failure to establish any 
amount of damages requires that the jury verdict be set aside in its entirety and judgment entered in favor of the Defendants as 
a matter of law that there were no damages at all."
689,25," The jury might have resolved the issue for the Defendants. Since it did not, in the event that the appellate court concludes that 
this Court should not have given the Defendants judgment as a matter of law, a new trial might not be necessary. "
690,26," ""Commonly included among improper means are violence, threats or intimidations, deceit or misrepresentation, bribery or 
defamation."" Chase v. Weight, Civ. No. 87-570- FR, 1988 WL 107051, *2 (D. Or. Oct. 12, 1988) (citations omitted). None of the 
improper means are at issue in this case."
690,27," The Court previously determined, as part of its antitrust analysis, that the PGA and the MAPGA are part of a single economic 
unit with the PGA having the ultimate control over the MAPGA's actions. A finding that two entities are unable to conspire under 
the antitrust laws, however, does not require a finding that one cannot interfere with the contractual relationship of the other. The 
relationship between the two though, may afford the ""parent"" a privilege to interfere with the contracts of its ""subsidiaries."" "
691,28," Contrary to Plaintiff's assertion at argument, the parent/subsidiary privilege has been held applicable to tortious interference 
with an existing contract, and is not limited to interference with prospective business relations. See Canderm, 862 F.2d 597; 
MNC Commercial v. Park Jensen Co., Civ. No. HAR-90-1055, 1991 WL 74137 (D. Md. 1991) (permitting secured creditor to 
interfere with debtor's existing contracts); Bendix Corp. v. Adams, 610 P.2d 24, 29-30 (Ala. 1980)."
691,29," Zenobia articulated the relevant legal standards for the award of punitive damages in non-intentional tort cases and cited with 
approval Schaefer for the standards applicable to intentional tort cases, such as tortious interference with contract. Zenobia, 601 
A.2d at n.21."
691,30," The Defendants argue that Seabury had to prove that ""the PGA actually knew that Seabury had the contractual right to have 
its 1992 or subsequent trade shows in Atlantic City."" (Defs.' Mot. for J. As A Matter of Law Or, In the Alternative, for A New Trial 
at 30-31.) This is not the standard applicable to a punitive damage award in an intentional tort action."
691,31," Plaintiff did introduce a December 1991, letter from MAPGA President Holley to Mr. Awtrey asserting that the contract did not 
place any limits on Seabury's right to select the show location. This evidence is contradicted by: (1) a letter written by MAPGA 
counsel Nemeroff one year earlier stating that ""the contract clearly contemplates a show within the geographical boundaries of 
the MAPGA,"" Pl.'s Ex. 73; and (2) Mr. Awtrey's response to Mr. Holley's letter stating the PGA's disagreement with Mr. Holley's 
conclusions, which were based on legal advice received by the PGA. Pl.'s Ex. 152. "
692,32," HN20[
] It is well settled law in Maryland that punitive damages may not by awarded in a pure breach of contract action. Schaefer, 587 A.2d at 492."
692,33," For example, Pl.'s Ex. 80 states:"
692,1," ) First choice of PGA of America - terminate contract between MAPGA and Seabury at all costs. Described as thermo 
nuclear!"
692,2," ) Show can continue in our Section. We can use any logo and PGA will approve a licensing agreement for Seabury to use 
our logo (PGA of America)."
692,3," ) Show can go on in Atlantic City, NJ in 1991 with no logos or reference to PGA (Seabury alone) While this document indicates that there were hostile feelings between the PGA and Seabury, it also is ambiguous enough to 
indicate that the PGA was concerned with protecting its trademarks and making sure these marks were not used in conjunction 
with events violating the PGA Section guidelines. See also Dickey Tr. at 56-57 (where Dickey testified that Mr. Awtrey ""was 
going to try to take the show out"" but never discussed how this was to happen or the basis for this statement); Anderson Tr. at 
31-32 (discussing Mr. Awtrey's desire to ""take out"" competition without directing that desire towards any one entity); Pl.'s Ex. 83 
(where discussion indicated that the show would be better business for the Defendants if there was no third party involvement: 
""Q: Can we live with Seabury involvement through 1991 or 1992? A: No; however, probably could if we owned show. Makes 
much more sense for them to leave.""). "
699,1,"  Significantly, these agreements require only that all units in the development use electric heat, not that they utilize high-
efficiency electric heating systems. Thus, while a builder or developer would not receive a grant for a home using less 
efficient electric baseboard heating, it would not lose potential grants for other homes in the development by building such a 
home. Through these agreements then, PP&L made a unit containing inefficient electric baseboard heating preferable to a 
unit using efficient gas or oil heating systems. The agreements would assist in efforts to ""block the entry of fossil fuels, 
especially gas, into new developments."" App. at 1624; see also app. at 4156."
699,2,"  It is unclear whether, as alleged in the complaints, a home had to use a high-efficiency heat pump to be designated as a 
Four-Star home. From the record, it appears that to qualify as a Four-Star home, and thus to receive the reduced rate, a 
home had to contain an RTS system and energy-efficient appliances. See app. at 1288-89, 3967."
699,3,"  Load management is the practice of shifting energy demand, or ""load,"" from peak daytime hours (during which there is 
usually the most demand) to nighttime (off-peak) hours. App. at 172. By shifting the demand on their generation facilities to 
off-peak times, electric companies can avoid having to increase their generating capacity to serve all their customers."
699,4,"  In their brief on appeal, the Oil Dealers also challenge a fourth PP&L practice -- a fossil fuel conversion program pursuant 
to which PP&L offers cash grants to contractors and homeowners if they replace fossil fuel heating systems with electric 
heating systems. While the record contains documents to support this allegation, neither the district court's opinion nor "
700,," either complaint refers to this practice. See Yeager's Fuel, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Power & Light Co., 804 F. Supp. 700, 702-
03 (E.D. Pa. 1992). Because the complaints do not challenge activity other than that associated with new home 
construction, we will not consider the Oil Dealers' challenge to the alleged conversion program."
700,5,"  The court also dismissed the Yeager's plaintiffs' RICO claim for failure to state a claim and the Losch state-law claims 
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3) because no federal-law claims remained in the case. The Oil Dealers do not challenge 
the district court's disposition of the RICO claim on appeal; our disposition of the antitrust claims will result in reversal of the 
district court's dismissal of the state-law claims in Losch."
700,6,  All citations to Ticor I will be to portions which were not reversed by the Supreme Court.
700,7,"  The Supreme Court in Parker thus first articulated the state action immunity doctrine after consulting the text and history of 
the Sherman Act. Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 351-52, 87 L. Ed. 315, 63 S. Ct. 307 (1943). Since Parker, however, 
when applying the state action immunity doctrine, courts and commentators have not distinguished between antitrust 
actions based on the Sherman Act and those based on other antitrust statutes. See, e.g., Porter Testing Laboratory v. 
Board of Regents for Oklahoma Agriculture & Mechanical Colleges, 993 F.2d 768 (10th Cir. 1993); Cine 42nd Street 
Theater Corp. v. Nederlander Organization, Inc., 790 F.2d 1032, 1039-40 (2d Cir. 1986); I Phillip Areeda & Donald F. 
Turner, Antitrust Law P 218 (1978). In FTC v. Ticor Title Insurance Co., 119 L. Ed. 2d 410, 112 S. Ct. 2169 (1992), the 
Supreme Court noted the possibility that state action immunity may not apply to alleged violations of the Federal Trade 
Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(1), but it declined to reach the issue because the parties had not raised it. Similarly, this 
case involves claims based on antitrust statutes other than the Sherman Act, but the Oil Dealers have not argued that the 
state action immunity doctrine does not apply to claims asserted under the other statutes. We therefore will not distinguish 
among the antitrust claims asserted in deciding the state action immunity issue. "
702,8,"  Omni and Hallie involved immunity of municipalities under the state action immunity doctrine, but the test to be applied in 
determining whether a state policy can support a claim of immunity is the same for municipalities as it is for private actors. 
The distinction between the two types of cases lies in the fact that private actors, unlike municipalities, must prove a second 
proposition -- that their actions were actively supervised by the state -- to obtain immunity for their actions. See Town of 
Hallie v. City of Eau Claire, 471 U.S. 34, 46, 85 L. Ed. 2d 24, 105 S. Ct. 1713 (1985). "
703,9,"  PP&L apparently did not mention to the Bureau or the PUC that some of these benefits were provided pursuant to all-
electric development agreements. See Pennsylvania's amicus brief at 5. Because PP&L does not here contend that 
benefits given to builders and developers as part of all-electric development agreements merit state action immunity, we 
need only examine the Bureau's findings as to benefits provided in the absence of such agreements. Therefore, since we 
are not according immunity to PP&L for activity which may not have been revealed or which may have been 
misrepresented to the Bureau and the PUC, there is no need either to decide whether PP&L actually misrepresented or 
omitted certain information when describing its activity to the PUC, or to consider the Oil Dealers' argument that a "
704,," defendant may not be accorded state action immunity when it has engaged in ""predation by abuse of governmental 
process."" Cf. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox at 349-51. "
713,1," Teche Sugar Company and South Coast Sugars, Inc., the two defendants, are both wholly owned subsidiaries of South 
Louisiana Sugar, Inc. "
714,2," See, e.g., Richard Posner, Antitrust Law: An Economic Perspective 173 (1976) (claiming that no difference exists between 
profit from increase in price of tying product and similar gains made through forcing consumer to purchase tied product). But see 
Kaplow, supra, at 520-25 (arguing that method in which market power is deployed may affect extent of harm to consumer). "
715,3," We do not imply that a plaintiff may not provide direct evidence of market power, obviating the need to inquire into the 
percentage of the tying market that the defendant commanded. See Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Servs., Inc., 504 
U.S. __, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 2088 (1992) (""It is clearly reasonable to infer that [a defendant] has market power to raise prices and 
drive out competiton in the after-markets, [where a plaintiff] offers evidence that [the defendant] did so.""). Cf. Stephen Calkins, 
Supreme Court Antitrust 1991-92: The Revenge of the Amici, 61 Antitrust L.J. 269, 301 (1993) (""The words 'per se' are 
conspicuously absent from Kodak's discussion of tying.""). "
719,1," Graduate students are not required to pay the UHS clinic fee, provided they have health insurance coverage that meets URI's 
requirements. "
720,2," LINA coverage requires the student to present for treatment at UHS in the first instance, pending possible referral to an outside 
health care provider."
720,3, Appellants' motion for class certification was stayed pending disposition of appellees' motions to dismiss.
720,4," At the same time, the district court declined to exercise jurisdiction over several pendent state-law claims, see 28 U.S.C. § 
1367(c)(3) (1993). Cf. infra note 11."
720,5," The tie-in must also affect a substantial volume of commerce in the tied market, see Kodak, 112 S. Ct. at 2079, a factor not at 
issue in this case. Further, we assume, without deciding, that URI is a participant in the insurance ""market,"" for antitrust 
purposes, simply because it receives a one-time $ 10 processing fee for each LINA policy sold to a URI student. "
721,6," Notwithstanding certain misgivings, we further assume, without deciding, that the amended complaint adequately pleads two 
other essential ""tying"" claim elements. These assumptions merely facilitate clearer focus on the core deficiency in appellants' 
antitrust claim. First, we presume that the products at issue are distinct, i.e., that each is distinguishable by consumers in the 
relevant market, and that there would be sufficient consumer demand for each individual product, and not merely as part of an 
integrated product ""package."" See Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 21-22, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 
(1984). But see id. at 39 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (noting obvious policy limits of ""two product"" rule, since almost every product 
could be broken down into smaller constituent parts that might be sold separately); Lee, 829 F. Supp. at 537 (""I do not believe 
plaintiffs have adequately alleged that this arrangement involved two separate products.""). Second, we accept, arguendo, the 
questionable contention that URI students are ""coerced"" financially into buying LINA coverage because only LINA insurance 
""dovetails"" with UHS clinic fee services."
721,7," As of 1991, for example, Rhode Island residents comprised only 56% of the URI student body. "
722,8," The Court noted that even assuming readily available price information, consumers rationally might decide not to investigate 
life-cycle costs if investigation would prove more costly than the potential savings. Id. at 2086. "
723,9," The Kodak Court elaborated on the complexity of the ""information"" needed to make an informed investment: In order to arrive at an accurate price, a consumer must acquire a substantial amount of raw data and undertake 
sophisticated analysis. The necessary information would include data on price, quality, and availability of products needed 
to operate, upgrade, or enhance the initial equipment, as well as service and repair costs, including estimates of breakdown 
frequency, nature of repairs, price of service and parts, length of ""down-time"" and losses incurred from down-time. Much of this information is difficult     some of it is impossible     to acquire at the time of purchase. During the life of a 
product, companies may change the service and parts prices, and develop products with more advanced features, a 
decreased need for repair, or new warranties. In addition, the information is likely to be customer specific; lifecycle costs will

723,10," Considering the recent hyperinflationary trends in the health care industry as a whole, UHS clinic fees have increased at fairly 
predictable increments since 1987: 1987-88 ($ 179); 1988-89 ($ 188); 1989-90 ($ 200.50); 1990-91 ($ 227); 1991-92 ($ 248); 
1992-93 ($ 312). LINA premiums have increased comparably over the same period, from $ 158 in 1987-88 to $ 369 in 1992-93. 
The record contains no evidence that prospective URI applicants would have great difficulty gaining access to this information 
from any number of reliable sources (e.g., URI application materials, URI admissions officials, past or current URI students, 
college entrance source books). Nor do appellants suggest that URI had any incentive to conceal the scope of past price 
increases. On the billing invoices it mails to students, URI routinely individualizes its charges for registration, tuition, UHS fees, 
LINA premiums, and taxes. "
724,11," The district court interpreted appellants' complaint as alleging claims based on substantive due process and the right to 
contract. Appellants concede that their ""cumbersome briefing"" contributed to this understanding, yet did not move for 
reconsideration. See Vanhaaren v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 989 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1993) (issues raised for the first time 
on appeal are deemed waived). Unfortunately, the procedural due process claim asserted on appeal is no less unwieldy. Inexplicably, appellants continue to urge that Rhode Island law disempowered URI from entering the ""business"" of health care 
and insurance, and that the LINA policies were merely a fraud or sham affording students no actual coverage. Although these 
allegations might be material to appellants' ultra vires claim under state law, which the district court dismissed without prejudice, 
cf.  Boston Envtl. Sanitation Inspectors Ass'n v. City of Boston, 794 F.2d 12, 13 (1st Cir. 1986) (noting that state actor's ""mere 
violation of state statutory requirements does not offend federal constitutional due process""), or conceivably may have served as 
a basis for some sort of consumer protection claim, appellants do not explain how URI's mere refusal to continue selling them a "
725,," service (i.e., education) would constitute an actionable ""deprivation"" of their ""property rights"" for federal due process purposes. 
Cf. id. (noting that ""an alleged breach of contract [by a state actor] does not amount to a deprivation of property without due 
process""); Jimenez v. Almodovar, 650 F.2d 363, 370 (1st Cir. 1981) (same). "

736,1, Canada Dry is just one of several named defendants in this lawsuit. 
738,2," At any given time, Canada Dry has one recommended wholesale price for each of its product offerings."
738,3," For purposes of calculating the distributors' commissions, charge tickets obtained from approved Canada Dry credit customers 
are treated as though they are cash collected."
738,4," Therefore, as Canada Dry observes, ""if the suggested wholesale price is $ 10 per case, and a distributor is able to charge $ 11 
per case on 100 cases, it will realize $ 100 of income in excess of its commission."""
738,5," Since March 1990, Canada Dry has required its distributors to use pre-printed invoices that list the suggested wholesale prices 
of all products offered by Canada Dry. Canada Dry will accept no other invoices from its distributors. To avoid showing retailers 
the pre-printed invoices listing the suggested wholesale prices of all Canada Dry products, some distributors would use their own 
invoices with their own prices handwritten on them and then, at the end of the day, transfer the information from their invoices 
onto Canada Dry's pre-printed invoices, which they would then submit to Canada Dry for credit."
738,6," According to Canada Dry, this dual-signature policy ""is designed to verify that the customer has received the Canada Dry 
promotional discount and that it was not simply pocketed by distributors, falsely claiming that it had been provided to the 
retailer."" Plaintiffs contend, however, that, because the dual-signature policy forces them to show retail customers the pre-
printed invoices, which list the suggested wholesale prices of all Canada Dry products ""regardless of whether or not they [are] 
subject to promotional discounts that particular week, the practical impact of the policy [is] to eliminate the distributors' ability to 
charge their own resale prices for any products while at the same time participating in [Canada Dry's] promotional program."" "
739,7," Plaintiffs assert that Canada Dry actually impounded the trucks of those distributors who failed to obtain the retailers' signatures 
on the pre-printed invoices. "
740,8," Although the viability of Albrecht's principles is in some doubt following the Supreme Court's decision in Continental T.V., Inc. v. 
GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977), Albrecht has not yet been overturned. 8 Phillip E. 
Areeda, Antitrust Law PP 1638, 1639 (1989) (suggesting, however, that the Supreme Court may have silently overruled

denied, 469 U.S. 1018, 105 S. Ct. 432, 83 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1984). "
747,1," Section 2 provides: HN1[
] Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or 
persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be 
deemed guilty of a felony . . . ."
747,15, U.S.C. § 2.
747,2," The twelve count complaint included claims for defamation, promissory estoppel, anticipatory breach of contract, breach of 
contract, breach of duty of good faith, common law fraud and deceit, tortious interference with contractual and business 
relations, tortious bad faith and unfair dealing, interference with prospective economic advantage, and intentional infliction of 
emotional distress. "
748,3," Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f) provides: HN4[
] Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion [for summary judgment] that the party cannot 
for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify the party's opposition, the court may refuse the application 
for judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be 
had or may make such other order as is just. (emphasis added)."
748,4," Plaintiffs claim that the circumstances in this case are ""somewhat similar"" to Miller v. Beneficial Management Corp., 977 F.2d 
834, 846 (3d Cir. 1992), where we held that the plaintiff's reliance on a Magistrate Judge's order waiving the Rule 56(f) affidavit 
requirement permitted this court to review the district court's termination of discovery, but we see no similarity (and plaintiffs have 
not articulated any) other than the fact that in neither case was an affidavit properly filed. "
749,5," At other times plaintiffs have argued the market should be ""dial up, computer driven remotely-monitored card-access security 
systems in the geographic region served by Bell Atlantic."" Memorandum of Law in Response to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, 
Docket No. 11 at 6-7 n.2; see also App. at 24 (Complaint) (""remotely monitored security devices""). "
750,6," See also Pastore Affidavit, Docket No. 21 at 6 (""At the time of the misconduct by Bell, to the best of my knowledge, NASSCO 
was the only supplier of such an integrated access control product.""); Plaintiffs' Br. in Opposition to Motion for Summary 
Judgment, Docket No. 22 at 5 n.3 (""This is not an instance of a superior product among inferior competing products. It is an 
instance of a product without competitors.""); Plaintiffs' Supplemental Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Motion for Summary 
Judgment, Docket No. 33 at 3 (""the NASSCO product constituted a unique product without parallel or substitute"")."
750,7," Plaintiffs' position as to the only specific facility that they did not install, the one at the Monroeville Revenue Accounting Center, 
is unclear. Even if this system was ""pirated"" from NASSCO, see Pastore Affidavit, Docket No. 21 at 9-10 (defendants ""were 
simultaneously meeting with another contractor, using NASSCO's engineering design for the MRAC""); Plaintiffs' Br. in 
Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment, Docket No. 22 at 12 (""an unsuccessful effort by defendants' to mimic the NASSCO 
product and install and implement that pirated technology at [MRAC]""), there is no evidence that the defendants attempted to 
market this system to others. The internal use at one site of the NASSCO product is insufficient to indicate a dangerous 
probability of achieving monopoly power. "
759,1," HN1[
] Section 8(e) makes it an unfair labor practice for any labor organization and any employer ""to enter into any contract or agreement, express or implied, whereby such employer . . . agrees to . . . cease doing business with any other person."" 29 
U.S.C. § 158(e) (1988). Any such contract shall to that extent be unenforceable and void. "
772,1," The ticket holder seeks injunctive relief and not damages. Therefore, only the standing of the players and souvenir sellers to 
bring an antitrust damages action is discussed below."
772,2," As plaintiffs note, the UW football team and the players cannot logically be separated from one another. Pls.' Mem. in Opp. to 
Mot. to Dismiss at 14."
772,3, The court's holding makes it unnecessary to analyze the claims of the souvenir sellers under the remaining AGC factors. 
773,4," The more analogous case here is Ostrofe, where the court held that an employee had antitrust standing because he was a 
direct victim of a conspiracy to restrain interstate trade and commerce. 740 F.2d at 742-43. "
774,5," This holding is dispositive of the ticket holder's claim that he has standing. See Lucas, 800 F.2d at 847. It is not necessary, 
therefore, for the court to consider the issues of antitrust injury and proximate cause as to the ticket holder. "
793,1, The Consolidated Class Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification is addressed in a separate opinion.
793,2," A horizontal conspiracy is an agreement between ""persons or firms in similar lines of endeavor or business, normally, 
therefore, between competitors."" Austin T. Stickells, Federal Control of Business: Antitrust Laws § 6 (1972)."
793,3," As defined in P 3(h) of the Consolidated and Amended Class Action Complaint, ""Prescription Brand Name Drugs"" are ""drugs 
that are sold under the brand name of the Manufacturer rather than the drug's generic name."" "
794,4," Defendant Medco has filed its own motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims under Section 2(f) of the Robinson-Patman Act. 
According to Medco, to state a Section 2(f) claim the plaintiffs must first adequately plead a cause of action under Section 2(a) of 
the Robinson-Patman Act. Medco maintains that the plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently plead a Section 2(a) claim. In support of 
its motion, Medco adopts and incorporates by reference the arguments made by the Manufacturer Defendants in support of their 
motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims under Section 2(a) of the Act."
794,5," Naturally, each of the Manufacturer Defendants is moving to dismiss the complaint only in those actions in which it has been 
named as a defendant and in which it has been served."
794,6," Medco's motion is contingent upon the resolution of the Manufacturer Defendants' motion to dismiss the Coordinated, 
Independent Plaintiffs' Robinson-Patman Act claims, and therefore will not be separately addressed. "
796,7," The defendants question the vitality of Poller's cautionary instruction against summary dismissal of antitrust litigation. However, 
we note that all of the cases with the Manufacturer Defendants primarily cite in support of its proposition that Poller has been 
effectively overruled deal with summary judgment issues. See e.g. Matsushita, 475 U.S. 574 at 578, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, 106 S. Ct. 
1348 (1986); Collins v. Associated Pathologists, Ltd., 844 F.2d 473, 477 (7th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 852, 102 L. Ed. 
2d 110, 109 S. Ct. 137 (1988). Here, we are still in the preliminary stages of the suit where the plaintiffs must surpass a lesser 
threshold in avoiding summary dismissal of their claims. "
797,8," The defendants cite to one of our own decisions, Ballard v. Johlic, No. 93 C3214, 1994 WL 11626, at *3 & n.5 (N.D.Ill. Jan. 3, 
1994), in support of the proposition that we should hold the plaintiffs to a heightened pleading standard. In Ballard we noted that 
Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires a plaintiff to state the grounds upon which his claim is based, and in 
stating such grounds the plaintiff is required to set forth factual allegations. Here, however, the plaintiffs have sufficiently 
buttressed the grounds for their antitrust claims with the minimum factual support necessitated by the Rules' notice pleading 
system."
797,9," Defendants Schering-Plough Corporation and Burroughs Wellcome Co. (collectively, ""Schering and Burroughs"") have filed a 
separate Reply Memorandum in support of the Manufacturer Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Consolidated and Amended 
Complaint. Schering and Burroughs essentially argue that the Consolidated Action complaint must be dismissed because the 
plaintiffs have failed to state separate, individual claims against each Manufacturer Defendant. For reasons which are set forth 
below in our discussion of the defendants' motion to dismiss the Robinson-Patman claims, we are not persuaded that such 
specific and presumably redundant allegations would be either helpful or necessary at this juncture."
797,10," The Manufacturer Defendants' motion to dismiss the Robinson-Patman claims is addressed to the claims of price 
discrimination asserted in the following three sets of complaints: (1) Rite Aid Corporation, et al. v. American Home Products 
Corp. et al., No. 93c1200 (""Rite Aid""); (2) the six complaints filed by Duker & Barrett and Mary Boies & Associates and the three 
additional, nearly-identical complaints filed by other counsel (collectively, the ""Duker-Boies"" complaints); and (3) Albertson's, Inc. 
et al. v. Abbott Laboratories et al., Civ. No. C-1-94-160 (S.D.Ohio) (""Albertson's"")."
797,11," The Rite-Aid and Duker-Boies complaint assert claims under Section 2(d) of the Robinson-Patman Act, a claim which is not 
asserted in the Albertson complaint. "
801,1," For a more detailed recitation of the facts and plaintiff's allegations, see Massachusetts School of Law at Andover, Inc. v. 
American Bar Ass'n, 846 F. Supp. 374, 376-77 (E.D. Pa. 1994)."
801,2," The organizational defendants are the American Bar Association, the American Association of Law Schools, Law School 
Admission Services, Inc., and the Law School Admission Council."
801,3," The 22 individual defendants are: James P. White, Nina Appel, Jose R. Garcia-Pedrosa, Laura N. Gasaway, Frederick M. Hart, 
Rudolph C. Hasl, Carl C. Monk, R.W. Nahstoll, Henry Ramsey, Jr., Norman Redlich, John E. Ryan, Gordon D. Schaber, Pauline "

Walwer, Sharp Whitmore, and Peter A. Winograd."
802,4," MSL challenges six criteria that encompass several of the more than 50 ABA standards: salary levels (ABA Standard 405); 
student-faculty ratios, limits on teaching hours and sabbatical requirement (ABA Standards 201 and 401-405); use of the Law 
School Admission Test or other test (ABA Standard 503); guidelines for law libraries (ABA Standards 602, 603, and 704); 
prohibition of for-credit bar review courses (ABA Standard 302(b)); and limits on hours that students may be employed (ABA 
Standard 305)."
802,5," In addition to a program by the accreditation committee -- which may or may not have included discussion of the criteria and 
standards complained of -- topics for panels and discussions included fund raising, lawyer competency, law school 
administration, and budgeting."
802,6," MSL's contention that the documents ""show that a large number of deans present at the Philadelphia workshop believed the 
ABA's student-faculty ratio to be unrelated to quality"" (emphasis added) requires a leap of faith I am unwilling to make. While 
some letters, dated 1988, mention the Philadelphia deans' workshop, the majority of letters are from 1987 and refer to the New 
Orleans workshop. "
803,7," If it be argued that the complaint could be interpreted to allege that the individual defendants each conspired with some or all of 
the others, the complaint becomes vague to the point of absurdity."
803,8," This analogy of the medical staff acting as corporate officers would act in relation to the corporation does not mean that 
personal jurisdiction over the corporation supports personal jurisdiction over the individual corporate officers. A corporate 
officer's or director's actions taken in his or her corporate capacity do not, by themselves, bring the officer or director personally 
within the jurisdiction of the court. Simkins Corp. v. Gourmet Resources Int'l, 601 F. Supp. 1336, 1345 (E.D. Pa. 1985). See also 
Amplifier Research Corp. v. Hart, 144 Bankr. 693, 696 (E.D. Pa. 1992) (president of defendant corporation dismissed for lack of 
personal jurisdiction when plaintiff did not set forth what president did to subject himself to jurisdiction); Donner v. Tams-Witmark 
Music Library, Inc., 480 F. Supp. 1229, 1233 (E.D. Pa. 1979) (courts generally have not exercised personal jurisdiction over 
individuals for their acts done in a corporate capacity). It is for that reason that the documents referred to on page 3 do not 
establish a basis for jurisdiction over an individual defendant even though he or she may have participated in the activity in 
question. "
804,9," I am aware of the Supreme Court's admonition that courts should not impose heightened pleading requirements in the absence 
of such requirements in the Federal Rules. Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Unit, 122 L. Ed. 2d 517, 113 S. Ct. 1160, 
1163 (1993). In this instance I am merely requiring the plaintiff to identify the alleged wrong and wrongdoer. "

814,1," Originally Roth also sued a number of medical doctors, tenants of Rhodes, on various conspiracy theories; he voluntarily 
dismissed as to them. "
817,2," On its face, the statute appears to be limited to chattel leases; no similar California statute relating to leases of real property 
exists. However, we do not suggest that, on appropriate facts, restrictions in real property leases may not violate antitrust laws. 
(See, e.g., People v. Mobile Magic Sales, Inc. (1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 1 [157 Cal.Rptr. 749].) "
821,3," In passing, we note the lack of courtesy to court and opposing counsel implied in such a last minute request for continuance, 
absent any excuse being tendered for the lateness of the request. "
826,1," For instance, as evidence of these threats, plaintiffs point to a statement by Prime's President, Robert Scheer, who testified 
that he had told Walker representatives, ""If you are going to sell K.M.B., it might affect our relationship. We'd have to see what 
happens to our business and act accordingly."" Pls.' Mem. in Opp. at 10. "
827,2," Offering little guidance on how the rule of reason standard can actually be applied, the Sylvania Court instead recited the 
classic articulation of the rule by Justice Brandeis in Board of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 62 L. Ed. 683, 38 S. Ct. 
242 (1918): The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes 
competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question the court must 
ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the 
restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the evil 
believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant 
facts. This is not because a good intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but because 
knowledge of intent may help the court to interpret facts and to predict consequences. As is discussed below, many courts have ""narrowed the broad-ranging inquiry called for by the rule of reason by insisting, at the 
threshold, that a plaintiff attacking vertical restrictions establish the market power of the defendant."" Graphic Products 
Distributors, Inc. v. Itek Corp., 717 F.2d 1560, 1568 (11th Cir. 1983). Accord Capital Imaging Assocs., P.C. v. Mohawk Valley 
Medical Assocs., 996 F.2d 537, 546 (2d Cir. 1993) (""The Supreme Court has never explicitly endorsed such a preclusive 
threshold approach . . . . Still, we recognize that . . . market power remains a highly relevant factor in rule of reason analysis"")."
827,3," Horizontal restraints are agreements between competitors at the same level of market structure. Vertical restraints are 
combinations of persons at different levels of the market structure, such as manufacturers and distributors. Oreck Corp. v. 
Whirlpool Corp., 579 F.2d 126 (2d Cir. 1978). Horizontal restraints have been characterized as ""naked restraints of trade with no 
purpose except stifling competition."" White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 263, 9 L. Ed. 2d 738, 83 S. Ct. 696 (1963). "
828,4," ""Interbrand competition is the competition among the manufacturers of the same generic product [e.g., among manufacturers 
of exhaust equipment] . . . and is the primary concern of antitrust law . . . . In contrast, intrabrand competition is the competition 
between the distributors -- wholesale or retail -- of a product of a particular manufacturer [e.g., among distributors of Walker 
exhaust equipment]."" Id. at 52, n.19."
828,5," Both of these cases reiterated the requirement set out in Oreck Corp. v. Whirlpool Corp., 579 F.2d 126, 133 (2d Cir. 1978). 
""The Court [in Oreck] clearly intended that the anti-competitive purpose or effect of the vertical restriction in that case had to be 
judged with respect to the vacuum cleaner industry as a whole, not simply that portion which handled the Whirlpool brand."" 
Yamaha, 625 F.2d at 397. As in the case before us, Yamaha and Swank each involve a manufacturer's unilateral refusal to deal with a distributor seeking 
to handle, for the first time, the manufacturer's products. Oreck, by contrast, involves a manufacturer's decision not to renew an 
existing distributorship arrangement."
828,6," ""Vertical restrictions promote interbrand competition by allowing the manufacturer to achieve certain efficiencies in the 
distribution of his products. These 'redeeming virtues' are implicit in every decision sustaining vertical restrictions under the rule 
of reason."" Sylvania, 433 U.S. at 54. Moreover, interbrand competition, when it exists, ""provides a significant check on the 
exploitation of intrabrand market power because of the ability of consumers to substitute a different brand of the same product."" 
Id. at 52, n.19. "
829,7," There is no dispute that the practice among distributors is to only carry one line of exhaust equipment at a time, due to space 
requirements. Transcript at 3 & 19, Dec. 16, 1993."
829,8," We express no opinion on the validity of this point, which of course plaintiffs are free to pursue in state court."
829,9," In this case, the court said: Even adopting the view that International Harvester reduced intrabrand competition by putting H & B out of business, H & B 
has not proven the effect to be any other than de minimis. Rivalry from International Harvester's other dealers makes this 
situation far different from the exclusive territorial arrangements which introduced the intrabrand competition concept into 
antitrust law. Id."
829,10," In Graphic Products, the court added, ""Situations in which intrabrand competition continues to be vigorous differ dramatically 
from those where the effect of the intrabrand restraint is to shut off all intrabrand competition."" Id. (citing Muenster Butane, 651 
F.2d at 298 (defendant's efforts to restrict intrabrand competition largely ineffectual, intrabrand competition continued unabated) 
& H & B Equipment Co., 577 F.2d at 246). "
830,11," The Second Circuit has stated a plaintiff may satisfy the initial burden: without detailed market analysis by offering proof of actual detrimental effects, such as a reduction of output. . . . Yet, where 
the plaintiff is unable to demonstrate such actual effects, it must at least establish that defendants possess the requisite 
market power so that their arrangement has the potential for genuine adverse effects on competition. Market power in that 
way serves as a surrogate for detrimental effects. Capital Imaging, 996 F.2d at 546 (internal citations and quotes omitted)."
830,12," Defendants' contest this definition, arguing that it excludes ""such major suppliers of exhaust equipment as Midas and 
Meineke, who sell a fully competitive product line and who plaintiffs admit are active participants in the competitive process."" 
Defs.' Joint Reply Mem. at 8. In a deposition, KMB's President, William Bastardi responded affirmatively when asked whether 
Midas and Meineke ""appear to be taking business that otherwise might go to the customers of your customers."" Bastardi II Tr. at 
154-55 (attached as Ex. G to Def. Walker's Rule 3(g) Statement). However, Midas and Meineke are not participants in the exhaust equipment aftermarket. An aftermarket can be defined as a 
separate market. C.f., Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Servs., 119 L. Ed. 2d 265, 60 U.S.L.W. 4465, 112 S. Ct. 2072 
(U.S. June 8, 1992) (No. 90-1029). Even under the more narrow definition of the relevant market offered by plaintiffs, we find plaintiffs have not produced adequate 
evidence demonstrating the defendants' conduct had a substantially harmful effect on competition when viewed in the context of 
the market structure."
830,13," ""Market share is frequently used in litigation as a surrogate for market power . . . . [It] directly relates to the effectiveness of 
interbrand competition in minimizing the anticompetitive effects of a restraint on intrabrand competition."" Graphic Products, 717 
F.2d at 1570."
830,14," According to the affidavit of Gregory A. Worny, Vice President, Marketing for AP, one of Walker's chief competitors, Walker 
controls at least 55-60 percent of the national aftermarket for exhaust equipment ultimately distributed to jobbers. Worny Aff. at P 
5 (Ex. 2). Moreover, when asked if it would surprise him that Walker's national market share is at least 70 percent, Jim Lown, 
Walker's Market Information Manager, replied ""no."" Lown Dep. at 83-84 (Ex. 8). Mr. Lown also indicated that he doubted that 
AP, which is probably Walker's closest competitor, has more than 10 percent market share. Id. at 69-71. It was not clear whether 
this is a national or regional figure. "
831,15," See Borger v. Yamaha, 625 F.2d 390, 397 (2d Cir. 1980) (finding it was reversible error to instruct a jury to find liability based 
on suppression of intrabrand competition when there was no evidence of either a purpose or effect related to interbrand 
competition); Morse v. Swank, 493 F. Supp. 110, 115 (S.D.N.Y. 1980) (granting defendants' summary judgment motion, finding 
plaintiff would not be excluded from cigarette lighter business; rather, he would only be prevented from marketing a particular

& B Holdings, Inc.; Pittsburgh Steelers, Inc.; Tampa Bay Area NFL Football, Inc.; Pro-Football, Inc.; Chargers Football Co.; and

Football Co. or the Charges Football Co. as defendants, and adds the New York Football Giants, Inc. to the list."
843,3," On October 22, 1993, a jury awarded William Sullivan $ 38 million, which was reduced by the district court upon motion by the 
defendants to $ 17 million, before trebling. The NFL defendants have appealed this verdict. "
844,4," During the bankruptcy proceedings, plaintiff received an assignment of all SMC's causes of action in consideration of the 
release of claims against SMC by plaintiff. The NFL argues that Sullivan, as SMC's assignee, is precluded from pursuing its antitrust claims against the NFL defendants 
because SMC did not disclose these claims during the course of the bankruptcy proceedings. They contend that, at least by 
October, 1990, when he entered into a stipulation with the bankruptcy trustee resolving claims by and against him, Sullivan was 
fully aware of all of the facts upon which his complaint is based and that his antitrust claims should have been raised in the 
bankruptcy proceedings. In their view, SMC is therefore estopped from bringing a legal action to enforce the claims against the 
NFL defendants. For the purposes of this decision, we assume, without deciding, that SMC is not estopped from bringing a legal action to enforce 
these claims."
844,5," It is unquestioned that the requirements of antitrust standing exceed those of standing in a constitutional sense. See 
Associated General Contractors, Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 535 n.31, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 103 S. 
Ct. 897 (1977); see also Daniel Berger & Roger Bernstein, An Analytical Framework for Antitrust Standing, 86 Yale L.J. 809, 813 
n.11 (1977). "
845,6," Prior to Associated General Contractors, circuit courts had crafted a variety of tests to determine whether a party injured by an 
antitrust violation had standing to bring an action for treble damages under Section 4 of the Clayton Act. The two most 
commonly stated tests focused on the ""directness of the injury"" to the alleged antitrust violation, and whether a plaintiff was in 
the ""target area"" of the antitrust conspiracy. See Associated General Contractors, 459 U.S. at 535-36 & n.33 (citations omitted); 
Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, P 334.1 (1993 Supp.). A third test considered whether the injury was 
""'arguably within the zone of interests protected by the antitrust laws.'"" Associated General Contractors, 459 U.S. at 536 n.33 
(citation omitted). In Associated General Contractors, the Court, noting that it was ""virtually impossible to announce a black-letter 
rule that will dictate the result in every case,"" 459 U.S. at 536, drew on these tests to outline a series of factors to guide courts in 
deciding whether a private plaintiff should have standing to pursue an antitrust action in a particular case. See id. at 536-46. "
846,7," Of course, as the Supreme Court has noted, HN4[
] the presence of an improper motive on the part of the defendants is not, 
by itself, determinative of antitrust standing. See Associated General Contractors, 459 U.S. 519, 537 & n.37 (noting that ""the 
availability of the § 4 remedy to some person who claims its benefit is not a question of the specific intent of the conspirators"") 
(quoting McCready, 457 U.S. at 479)."
846,8," We recognize that there is a risk of duplicate recovery and complex apportionment of damages as between Sullivan, in his 
individual capacity, and SMC, in light of their seemingly overlapping injuries. We think that this can be avoided, however, given 
that plaintiff brings this single action for damages suffered by both."
846,9," Some courts have concluded that a consideration of antitrust injury is of threshold significance in the Section 4 standing inquiry. 
See, e.g., Balaklaw v. Lovell, 14 F.3d 793, 797-98 & n.9 (2d Cir. 1994); Todorov v. DCH Healthcare Authority, 921 F.2d 1438, 
1449 (11th Cir. 1991); see also State of South Dakota v. Kansas City Southern Industries, 880 F.2d 40, 46 (8th Cir. 1989) 
(noting primacy of antitrust injury requirement). Cf.  Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 110, n.5, 93 L. Ed. 2d 
427, 107 S. Ct. 484 (1986) (pointing out, in the course of considering antitrust injury requirement for private plaintiffs seeking an 
injunction under Section 16 of the Clayton Act, that a showing of antitrust injury was a necessary (though not always sufficient) 
element of standing to sue for damages under Section 4). We agree that HN5[
] the absence of antitrust injury weighs heavily against a grant of standing. We need not consider, 
however, whether this should be fatal to standing in every instance, because in the circumstances of this case, we conclude that 
the balance of factors as a whole weighs against a grant of standing. "
848,10," In this respect, we disagree with defendants' argument that SMC, merely by virtue of its status as the Patriots' landlord, is 
necessarily barred from bringing suit for injury to its tenant. HN7[
] Whether a landlord has standing to sue for injury to its 
tenant depends, in part, on the relationship of the landlord to the relevant market and to the antitrust violation. For example, a 
landlord may have standing to sue for injuries to a tenant based on its status as a competitor in an adjacent market, see Los 
Angeles Coliseum, 791 F.2d at 1363-65."
848,11," These courts reason that the injury suffered by a plaintiff used as a means to effect an antitrust violation is within the core of 
Congressional concern underlying the antitrust laws, which is ""to create a private enforcement mechanism that would deter 
violators and deprive them of the fruits of their illegal actions and would provide ample compensation to the victims of antitrust 
violations."" Ashmore, 843 F. Supp. at 770 (quoting McCready, 457 U.S. at 472); see also Ostrofe, 740 F.2d at 746-47. "
850,12," Contrary to plaintiff's assertion, the district court's finding that there was no significant risk of duplicative recoveries or danger 
of complex apportionment of damages is not at odds with its determination that the fact that William Sullivan was pursuing his 
own antitrust action weighed against a grant of standing. HN10[
] In considering the risk of duplicativeness and complex 
apportionment of damages, courts are concerned with keeping antitrust actions within judicially manageable limits by curtailing 
litigation involving apportionment of damages among an array of parties claiming injury. See Associated General Contractors, 
459 U.S. at 543-45 & nn.50-51; see also Southaven, 715 F.2d at 1087. In considering directness, courts are concerned with the 
question of which among the affected parties are most likely to be motivated to pursue an antitrust action. While in the usual 
case, this would be those most directly affected by the antitrust violation, in some cases, more remote parties might be more 
likely to detect and pursue an antitrust action. See Associated General Contractors, 459 U.S. at 542; see also Ashmore, 843 F. 
Supp. at 766-67 (appropriate to grant standing to employees discharged for refusal to implement discriminatory pricing system, 
because purchasers, though directly damaged by anticompetitive effect of violation, are least likely to discover it). "
852,**, The panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument. Fed. R. App. P. 34(a); 9th Cir. R. 34-4. 
854,*," This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 
9th Cir. R. 36-3."
854,1," The defendants attached to their motion to dismiss several documents that had been filed in the other state and federal 
lawsuits. Generally, HN2[
] if matters outside the pleadings are presented and not excluded by the district court, a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim must be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided by Fed. R. Civ. P. 
56. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b). Nevertheless, ""on a motion to dismiss a court may properly look beyond the complaint to matters of 
public record and doing so does not convert a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to one for summary judgment."" Mack v. South Bay Beer 
Distribs., Inc., 798 F.2d 1279, 1282 (9th Cir. 1986). Accordingly, the district court properly considered the defendants' motion as 
one brought under Rule 12(b)(6). See id."
854,2," HN4[
] To establish a violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act, ""a plaintiff must demonstrate three elements: (1) an 
agreement, conspiracy, or combination among two or more persons or distinct business entities; (2) which is intended to harm or 
unreasonably restrain competition; and (3) which actually causes injury to competition, beyond the impact on the claimant, within 
a field of commerce in which the claimant is engaged (i.e., 'antitrust injury')."" McGlinchy v. Shell Chem. Co., 845 F.2d 802, 811 
(9th Cir. 1988). ""To establish a section 2 violation for an attempt to monopolize, a plaintiff must demonstrate four elements: (1) 
specific intent to control prices or destroy competition; (2) predatory or anti-competitive conduct directed toward accomplishing 
that purpose; (3) a dangerous probability of success; and (4) causal antitrust injury."" Id. "
855,3," Nor has Heisen alleged any facts that suggest that ""the relevant market is both narrow and discrete and the market 
participants are few."" See Les Shockley Racing, 884 F.2d at 508-09. Accordingly, this is not a case in which injury to one market 
competitor is tantamount to injury to competition. See id."
855,4," The district court found that Heisen's complaint failed to state a claim because the defendants were all agents or employees of 
PABCO, and therefore could not be conspirators within the meaning of the Sherman Act. See Copperweld Corp. v. 
Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 769, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984) (""officers or employees of the same firm 
do not provide the plurality of actors imperative for a § 1 conspiracy""). We decline to rest our decision on this ground. See Smith 
v. Block, 784 F.2d 993, 996 n.4 (9th Cir. 1986) (""in reviewing a district court decision, we may affirm on any ground finding 
support in the record"")."
855,5," ""If a complaint is accompanied by attached documents, . . . these documents are part of the complaint and may be considered 
in determining whether the plaintiff can prove any set of facts in support of the claim."" Durning v. First Boston Corp., 815 F.2d 
1265, 1267 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 944 (1987). "
856,6," All fifteen claims in Heisen's complaint also refer to the Clayton Act, but do not cite to any specific section. Nevertheless, 
Heisen fails to state a claim under the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, because the complaint does not 
allege any conduct prohibited by the statute. See 15 U.S.C. § 13(a) (prohibiting price discrimination); 15 U.S.C. § 14 (prohibiting 
exclusive dealing contracts)."
856,7," In his briefs, Heisen also argues that the district court erred by (1) failing to consider all of his causes of action, (2) failing to 
consider his request for punitive sanctions against opposing counsel, (3) failing to consider that Heisen appeared pro se, (4) 
threatening to sanction Heisen if he filed future actions against the same defendants, (5) denying discovery, and (6) depriving 
Heisen of his rights to a jury trial and to due process. We have considered these issues and conclude that they are meritless. "

868,7," For purposes of this motion, the court assumes arguendo that to the extent that ROP advertising constitutes a separate market 
(the ""ROP market"") from the Advertising Circulars market, PNI has monopoly power over the ROP market. See Def.'s Mem., p. 
33 n.24; see also, Pl.'s Ex. 8, DiMartino Dep. Ex. 13, p. 13 (""PNI, with advertising revenues of nearly $ 300 million, controls the

869,10," There are two alternative definitions of ""entry barriers."" Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 409' (1993 
Supp.). Under the ""Stiglerian"" definition, a barrier to entry is identified by ""additional long-run costs that were not incurred by 
incumbent firms but must be incurred by new entrants."" Id. Under the ""Bainin"" definition, entry barriers are factors in the market 
that deter entry while permitting incumbent firms to earn monopoly returns. Id."
869,11," The entry question focuses on whether competitors will choose to enter the relevant market in the event of supracompetitive 
pricing by PNI, not on whether this particular plaintiff would choose to reenter the market, if it first chooses to leave the 
Philadelphia market due to PNI's alleged predatory conduct. See Chillicothe Sand & Gravel v. Martin Marietta Corp., 615 F.2d 
427, 431 (7th Cir. 1980) (monopoly pricing must be assessed in light of its effect on competition rather than on a competitor). 
Plaintiff's expert opines that predation ""might"" discourage entry. Pl.'s Ex. 25, Rapp Dep. p. 263; see also, Pl.'s Surreply Ex. 6, 
Rapp. Dep Ex. 7 p. 602-03 (""The 'bodies on the lawn' problem does not mean that recoupment can never be disproved by 
invoking the structural facts. Rather, this line of research has shown that there are specific market circumstances in which 
invoking easy entry is not enough to dispel the possibility of recoupment from a predatory pricing campaign."") (emphasis added). Advo choose not to reenter the Hartford market because ""Hartford regional resources would be better spent developing more 
potentially lucrative opportunities in Boston, Long Island and New York City."" Pl.'s Ex. 15, Kamerschen Dep. Ex. 3, p. 1. Plaintiff "
870,," has not demonstrated a predicate for using the Hartford market experience as a predictor of the likelihood of reentry into the

871,20," The court notes that there is nothing inherently predatory about basing a discount on an advertiser's total volume of business. 
Each sale increases marginal profitability. See O. Hommel Co. v. Ferro Corp., 659 F.2d 340, 351 (3d Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 
455 U.S. 1017, 72 L. Ed. 2d 134, 102 S. Ct. 1711 (1982). Assuming that PNI intended to monopolize the relevant market, this 
fact alone is not sufficient to establish the dangerous probability of success that is the object of the Sherman Act's section 2 
prohibition of attempts. Pastore, 1994 WL 189478 at 5. "
872,21," Although the size of a defendant's market share is a significant determinant of whether a defendant has a dangerous 
probability of successfully monopolizing the relevant market, it is not the exclusive factor. Barr Lab. Inc. v. Abbott Lab., 978 F.2d 
98, 112 (3d Cir. 1992); see also, Fineman, 980 F.2d at 201-02. Other factors to be considered include the strength of 
competition, probable development of the industry, the barriers to entry, the nature of the anti-competitive conduct, and the 
elasticity of consumer demand. Id. Because PNI has conceded for purposes of this motion that it has monopoly power over the ROP market, the court assumes 
that PNI already charges or can charge ROP advertisers whatever price it believes will maximize its profits."

872,24," The court notes that when PNI undercut Advo's price, Super Fresh chose to remain an Advo customer, despite Advo's 
comparatively higher price. See Def. Ex. 20, p. 3. The inelasticity of demand in this market, i.e., relatively low sensitivity to just 
price as a determining factor in relationships, blunts predatory pricing as a weapon. See supra note 19 and pp. 11-12."
872,25," Joseph P. Durrett, Advo's President and Chief Operating Officer, was asked the following question during his deposition: So it's your testimony that you think a reasonable time period for someone coming into a market and starting up a new

3464 (E.D. Pa.), Advo's expert concluded that: Entry into the market is comparatively easy. Little initial capital is required relative to many other businesses. Mailing lists 
and operational expertise are available from many sources. Indeed, clients of ADVO could individually or in groups easily 
enter the production of a service much like that of ADVO if ADVO and competitors attempted to charge unreasonable, 
supracompetitive prices. In fact, entry into the ""shared mail"" business appears to be proliferating. This takes several forms. 
For example, third class bulk mailers have started new, directly competitive shared mail programs or have expanded prior 
programs. Newspapers are using third class mail for total market coverage (""TMC"") of advertising inserts as a supplement 
to their regular subscriber base. And, in addition, many utilities and credit card companies use a form of ""shared mail"" with 
their billings. Def. Ex. 39, P 7. Although plaintiff claims that this finding is not supported by subsequent developments of the Advertising Circulars market, it 
points to no such developments which would vitiate the finding. "

exceeded $ 300,000. Id. at 408. Moreover, the Kelco defendants' market share was always greater than 55% and at one time

business to Advo for $ 4.93 million in October, 1992. Stipulated Facts, P 8. "
874,30," The court notes that HN8[

cephalosporin market. 575 F.2d at 1065. Additionally, the defendant controlled from 100% to 89.8% of the cephalosporin market 
and the barriers to entering the market were substantial (plaintiff's entry required five-year $ 20,000,000 research and 
development program). Id. In contrast, in the case at bar, the ROP market and the Advertising Circulars market constitute two 
separate product markets and the defendant only maintains a 57.6 percent market share of the ROP market and a 40.1 percent 
market share of Advertising Circulars market. Pl.'s Ex. 31, Beyer Report Ex. 12. Additionally, the Advertising Circulars market

883,1," Vascular surgery is one of seven primary components of general surgery. In plain terms, vascular surgery involves the blood 
vessels, excluding those associated with the brain and heart. During the year he trained at New York Medical College, Plaintiff 
performed and assisted in reconstructive vascular surgery, peripheral bypasses, microscopic vessel surgery, and trauma cases. "
884,2," As of August, 1993, Georgia Vascular Surgery employed three vascular surgeons, including Plaintiff. In 1992, Georgia Vascular 
Surgery had a gross profit of over $ 787,000 on gross income of approximately $ 851,000. Georgia Vascular Diagnostics had 
gross receipts of $ 220,000 and a gross profit of $ 202,000. Poindexter Depo., pp. 254-55"
884,3," Plaintiff is a diplomate of the Board, having received the Board's general surgery certificate. "
886,4," The Court refuses to analyze this case as a ""group boycott"" insofar as Plaintiff may be seeking to invoke a per se determination 
of illegality. See FTC v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 2018, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1986) (""the

2d 330 (1982), is misplaced. That association's codes, though only advisory, had a ""powerful influence: federal regulations have 
incorporated many of them by reference, as have the laws of most States, the ordinances of major cities, and the laws of all the 
provinces of Canada."" 102 S. Ct. at 1938-39. "

specially pleaded."""
896,2," Plaintiffs cite Foods, Inc. for the proposition that all First Amendment protections must be raised prior to the close of trial. 
Foods, Inc. does not stand for such a broad proposition. It merely holds that, when a First Amendment does constitute an 
affirmative defense, it must be properly raised under rule 101 in order to preserve error.  Foods, Inc., 240 N.W.2d at 920-21. "
897,3," Plaintiffs cite only one case they claim to be contra: North Carolina Elect Membership Corp. v. Carolina Power & Light Co., 
666 F.2d 50, 52 (4th Cir. 1982). Plaintiffs' interpretation of North Carolina was however rejected by the 4th circuit in Hospital

to the general applicability of issue preclusion analysis in this case."
898,5," A higher standard is usually reserved for situations where particularly important constitutional rights, such as deportation, are 
at stake. When this type of interest is implicated a clear and convincing evidentiary standard is generally utilized. See Woodby v.

912,1," In his memorandum replying to defendants' arguments against granting his motion, plaintiff also sur-replied to defendants' 
reply memorandum supporting their motion. Because my rules of practice generally prohibit sur-replies, and because plaintiff did 
not request permission to sur-reply, this portion of plaintiff's memorandum has been disregarded. "
914,2," Plaintiff makes no attempt to reconcile this argument with his argument that Sierra News Co., allegedly one of the nation's 
largest wholesalers of the DRF, has standing as a direct purchaser from DRF. (See infra pp. 9-10) Presumably, these are 
alternative arguments. "

923,5," Reiman's primary claim against Stolp and the other civilian defendants appeared to be a state law claim of defamation. We 
found that because the District Court properly dismissed Reiman's federal claims before trial, this pendent state law claim was 
also properly dismissed. See Cook, Perkiss & Liehe v. Northern Cal. Collection Serv., 911 F.2d 242, 247 (9th Cir. 1990)."
923,6," Reiman's second complaint did, however, add one additional defendant -- President George Bush."
923,7," The Western District of Texas, Judge Edward C. Prado, ruled that its dismissal of Reiman's action with prejudice would have a 
res judicata effect on similar cases filed by Reiman throughout the United States. "
924,8," For example, Reiman apparently contends that both the Preamble and Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution 
provide a basis for subject matter jurisdiction. "
926,9," Judy Reiman and Kevin Beckley were parties to John Reiman's first action in the Central District of California. But, Judy 
Reiman and Kevin Beckley were not parties to Reiman's appeal to this Court. However, failure to appeal does not change the 
fact that their claims were derivative of John Reiman's. "
930,1," Counsel for the NBA objected to the shortness of the trial as well as its expedited nature. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
authorize me to order a speedy hearing for a declaratory judgment action. Fed. R. Civ. P. 57. Thus, they cannot be heard to "
931,," complain about the expedited nature of a case they initiated. In addition, several other reasons exist for speeding this case 
along. First, the Teams and the Players use this period to sign contracts and prepare for the upcoming season. It would be unfair 
to allow this litigation to create a legal cloud over contract negotiations. (See Trial Testimony of David J. Stern, July 12, 1994, at 
155-60 (hereinafter ""Tr."")). Moreover, the raw facts that underlie this action are not in dispute. The dispute centers on the 
applicable legal standard. Therefore, the parties simply needed an opportunity to put the facts on the record. The parties had 
ample time to do so before, during, and after trial. Finally, I received the parties' papers on July 5, 1994. In such a complicated 
case that must be resolved quickly, only a judge unwilling to have an open mind would attempt to rule prior to a detailed factual 
hearing. Therefore, I ordered a trial on the merits for July 11, 1994."
931,2," The initiation of the declaratory judgment action cannot be said to violate Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. It 
does, however, constitute sharp and shady practices of the type that most ethical lawyers shun. "
933,3," In addition to the objection outlined in the text, the NBA objected to the July 11, 1994 trial, contending that jurisdiction did not 
exist because of the Norris-LaGuardia Act's prohibition against injunctions involving labor disputes. See 29 U.S.C. § 101 et seq. 
Putting aside the merits of this dubious proposition, but see Jackson v. National Football League, 802 F. Supp. 226, 233 
(D.Minn. 1992); Cordova v. Bache & Co., 321 F. Supp. 600, 606 (S.D.N.Y. 1970), the trial was necessary to elicit the facts of the 
claims set forth in the NBA's declaratory judgment action. It astounds me to no end that the NBA initiated this action, and then 
attempted to hinder the court from taking the necessary steps to decide this matter quickly. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 57. But, it may 
be merely the continuation of the practices referred to in footnote 2. "
935,4," Senior Judge Heaney dissented in Powell II and Chief Judge Lay, along with Judge McMillian, dissented from a denial of a

exemption to apply union consent is necessary, and encourages union decertification. Powell II, 930 F.2d at 1304-10 (dissenting 
opinions). Both dissents favor application of the impasse standard enunciated by the district court. Id."

936,6," On behalf of a concurring panel of three, Justice Goldberg urged a holding that ""a union acting as a union, in the interests of its 
members, and not acting to fix prices or allocate markets in aid of an employer conspiracy to accomplish these objects . . . is not 
subject to challenge under the antitrust laws."" Jewel Tea, 381 U.S. at 710 (Goldberg, J., concurring). "

943,1," 15 U.S.C. § 26 provides, in pertinent part, that any HN4[
] ""person, firm, corporation or association shall be entitled to sue for 
and have injunctive relief, in any court of the United States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or 
damage by a violation of the antitrust laws."""
943,2," Our resolution of the issue of the relevant geographic market has made it unnecessary for us to reach all of the issues 
presented on appeal. Defendants raise several challenges to the theories of liability upon which the present case was submitted 
to the jury. Defendants first argue that, as a matter of law, a medical referral from one specialist to another is an act of medical 
judgment and cannot support antitrust liability. Defendants also argue that an actual monopolization claim must be predicated on 
the market domination of a single defendant or single economic entity and cannot be established by combining the market power 
of multiple defendants. There is a split in authority on this question. See generally Julian O. von Kalinowski, Antitrust Laws and "
944,," Trade Regulation §§ 17.01[2], 19.06 (1993); II E. Kinter, Federal Antitrust Law, § 16.2, at 482 (1980) (indicating that several 
firms acting in concert can be guilty of actual monopolization). Defendants further contend that, if this Court recognizes such a 
joint monopolization claim, it should treat such a claim as a conspiracy to monopolize claim, and, thus, require an agreement 
among defendants to commit an anti-competitive act. The jury in the present case was not instructed regarding the finding of an 
agreement. We are cognizant that no circuit has squarely addressed these questions. Even were we to rule in Morgenstern's 
favor on these issues, defendants would still be entitled to judgment in their favor. We consequently leave resolution of these 
issues for an appropriate case."
944,3," Within the relevant geographic market found by the jury (Lincoln and twenty-six surrounding counties, but not including 
Omaha), defendants possessed close to eighty percent of the market share of the patients. HN7[
] An eighty percent market 
share is within the permissible range from which an inference of monopoly power can be drawn. If, as defendants contend, the 
relevant geographic market includes Omaha, then defendants have only a thirty percent market share. As a matter of law, 
absent other relevant factors, a thirty percent market share will not prove the existence of monopoly power. See, e.g., Fineman 
v. Armstrong World Indus., Inc., 980 F.2d 171, 201 (3d Cir. 1992) (fifty-five percent market share is insufficient to constitute 
monopoly power), cert. denied, 122 L. Ed. 2d 677, 113 S. Ct. 1285 (1993); Domed Stadium Hotel, Inc. v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 732 
F.2d 480, 489 (5th Cir. 1984) (ninety percent is enough, sixty percent is not likely to suffice, and thirty-three is insufficient) 
(citations omitted); Lektro-Vend Corp. v. Vendo Co., 660 F.2d 255 (7th Cir. 1981) (thirty percent market share insufficient), cert. 
denied, 455 U.S. 921, 71 L. Ed. 2d 461, 102 S. Ct. 1277 (1982); United States v. Empire Gas Corp., 537 F.2d 296 (8th Cir. 
1976) (forty-seven to fifty percent share in liquid propane gas market held insufficient), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1122, 51 L. Ed. 2d 
572, 97 S. Ct. 1158 (1977). "
952,1," UPI voluntarily dismissed its complaint against all defendants in February 1990, and is no longer a party to this suit. See Firm, 
Building Trades, Settle Feud Over Environmental Concerns at Steel Plant, Daily Lab. Rep. (BNA), Mar. 1, 1990, at A-8."
952,2," There is also a non-statutory exemption for agreements between unions and employers that are intimately related to the 
unions' vital concern with wages, hours and working conditions.  Connell Construction Co. v. Plumbers & Steamfitters Local No. 
100, 421 U.S. 616, 622, 44 L. Ed. 2d 418, 95 S. Ct. 1830 (1975); Richards v. Neilson Freight Lines, 810 F.2d 898, 905 (9th Cir. 
1987). As no such collective bargaining relationship existed here, the non-statutory exemption is not at issue. "
953,3," BE&K also complains that the district court improperly assigned to it the burden of proving that the statutory labor exemption 
did not apply, since defendants normally bear the burden of proving exceptions to the antitrust laws. See Feather v. UMWA, 711 
F.2d 530, 542 (3d Cir. 1983); Consolidated Express, Inc. v. New York Shipping Ass'n, 602 F.2d 494, 521 (3d Cir. 1979), vacated 
on other grounds, 448 U.S. 902 (1980); 9 Julian O. von Kalinowski, Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulation, § 81.09[2] (1993). But 
the statutory exemption is not an affirmative defense; it's an element of any claim that unions violated the antitrust laws. Plaintiff 
bears the burden of proof. See Pennington, 381 U.S. at 669 (""the alleged agreement between UMW and the large operators . . ., 
if proved, was not exempt from the antitrust laws""); Richards, 810 F.2d at 902 (""failure on the part of the plaintiff to produce 
evidence from which a jury could infer reasonably that conduct was conspiratorial, not unilateral, will lead to summary judgment 
for the defendant""); Bodine Produce, 494 F.2d at 561 (plaintiff must specifically allege non-labor group combination); Mid-
America Regional Bargaining Ass'n v. Will County Carpenters Dist. Council, 675 F.2d 881, 886 (7th Cir. 1982) (""if the 
defendants' conduct is to fall outside the statutory exemption, the plaintiffs must allege a conspiracy under Allen Bradley""). But 
see United States Steel Corp. v. Fraternal Ass'n of Steelhaulers, 431 F.2d 1046, 1051 (3d Cir. 1970) (union failed to meet 
burden of proving element of statutory exemption)."
953,4," Indeed, the case law is saturated with confusing formulations. See Jacksonville Bulk Terminals, Inc. v. International 
Longshoremen's Ass'n, 457 U.S. 702, 721, 73 L. Ed. 2d 327, 102 S. Ct. 2672 (1982) (labor group depends on ""the presence of a 
job or wage competition or some other economic interrelationship affecting legitimate union interests"") (quoting American 
Federation of Musicians v. Carroll, 391 U.S. 99, 106, 20 L. Ed. 2d 460, 88 S. Ct. 1562 (1968)); H.A. Artists & Assocs. v. Actors' 
Equity Ass'n, 451 U.S. 704, 717, 68 L. Ed. 2d 558, 101 S. Ct. 2102 (1981) (""nonlabor group"" consists of ""persons who are not 
'parties to a labor dispute'"" within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act) (quoting Hutcheson, 312 U.S. at 232); Allen Bradley, 
325 U.S. at 798, 801, 809 (union lost statutory exemption where it combined with ""employers and manufacturers of goods"" to 
""aid and abet business men to do the precise things which the Act prohibits""; ""when [a union participates] with a combination of 
business men who had complete power to eliminate all competition among themselves and to prevent all competition from 
others, a situation [is] created not included within the exemptions of the Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia Acts""). "
954,5," There appears to be at least one exception to this general rule. In some cases, a party that would otherwise meet the definition 
of a ""non-labor group"" was considered a ""labor group"" because of an ""economic interrelationship"" between that party and the 
union. See, e.g., Jacksonville Bulk Terminals, 457 U.S. at 721 (status as ""labor group"" depends on ""whether there is 'some . . . 
economic interrelationship affecting legitimate union interests'""); Carroll, 391 U.S. at 106 (""labor group"" characterized by ""job or 
wage competition or some other economic interrelationship affecting legitimate union interests between the union members"" and 
the purported ""labor group""); accord H.A. Artists, 451 U.S. at 718. "
955,6," Some cases had suggested that the union must combine with a non-labor group as a predicate for antitrust liability. In Allen 
Bradley, 325 U.S. at 810, the Court explained that whether union activities violated the Sherman Act was ""dependent upon 
whether the union acts alone or in combination with business groups."" See, e.g., Hunt v. Crumboch, 325 U.S. 821, 89 L. Ed. 
1954, 65 S. Ct. 1545 (1945) (unilateral actions of union to drive petitioner out of business are immune from Sherman Act 
liability); Embry-Riddle Aeronautical Univ. v. Ross Aviation, Inc., 504 F.2d 896, 903-04 (5th Cir. 1974) (""A Union can, without 
forfeiting the exemption, . . . act with a purpose to injure or even eliminate the business of an employer . . . . What makes the 
exemption disappear is sufficient proof of a concerted purpose, between the union and a favored employer."") (emphasis in 
original); Bodine Produce, 494 F.2d at 550 (""Following Hutcheson, the issue became primarily one of whether there existed an 
improper combination with non-labor groups.""). Other cases had suggested that illegitimate purpose alone might bring a union outside the statutory exemption. See, e.g., 
Jacksonville Bulk Terminals, 457 U.S. at 714 (""the protections of [the statutory labor exemption] do not extend to labor 
organizations when they cease to act as labor groups or when they enter into illegal combinations with non-labor groups in 
restraint of trade"") (emphasis added); Allied Int'l, Inc. v. International Longshoremen's Ass'n, 640 F.2d 1368, 1380 & n.12 (1st 
Cir. 1981) (although ILA didn't conspire with any non-union group, its boycott of Soviet cargo was not immunized by statutory 
exemption because it didn't relate to ""legitimate union interest""), aff'd, 456 U.S. 212, 72 L. Ed. 2d 21, 102 S. Ct. 1656 (1982); 
Bodine, 494 F.2d at 558 (activities of non-labor group combination remain within statutory exemption because union was 
pursuing own interests). "
956,7," Congress has provided special protection for certain traditional union activities in 29 U.S.C. § 104, which, inter alia, prohibits 
restraining orders or injunctions where persons involved in a labor dispute engage in work stoppage, publicize the existence or 
facts of their dispute, assemble or organize to promote their interest in the dispute, advise or notify persons of their intent to do 
any of these acts, or advise, urge, cause or induce without fraud or violence any of these acts."
956,8," BE&K also vaguely alleged that there were violent pickets. But violence alone is not sufficient to turn protected conduct like 
labor picketing into an antitrust violation. See Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 513, 84 L. Ed. 1311, 60 S. Ct. 982 
(1940); Bodine Produce, 494 F.2d at 559. "
958,9," The twenty-nine actions are listed in paragraph 32(b) of the Second Amended Complaint. BE&K lists separately seven suits in 
federal court and eight arbitration actions the unions filed against Eichleay Corporation. All were successful and ultimately 
enforced by the Third Circuit in Eichleay Corp. v. International Assoc. of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Iron Workers, 944 
F.2d 1047 (1991)."
958,10," Before us, the unions have moved for sanctions on the ground that BE&K's continued prosecution of this issue after the 
Supreme Court decided Professional Real Estate Investors was frivolous. We obviously disagree. "

963,1," At oral argument plaintiff expressly abandoned a fifth statutory cause of action, based on the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Civ. Code, 
§ 51.5). Our discussion of the complaint will, naturally, disregard this count. In light of plaintiff's abandonment, however, we will 
direct the trial court to sustain the demurrer to this count."
963,2," Insurance Code sections 790- 790.10 are often referred to as the ""Unfair Practices Act."" (See Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman's Fund 
Ins. Companies (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287, 292 [250 Cal.Rptr. 116, 758 P.2d 58]; Royal Globe Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1979) 23 
Cal.3d 880, 883 [153 Cal.Rptr. 842, 592 P.2d 329], overruled in Moradi-Shalal, supra, 46 Cal.3d at pp. 292, 304.) The 
Legislature, however, has mysteriously labeled this portion of the Insurance Code the ""Unfair Trade Practices Act."" (Ins. Code, § 
1620.2, subd. (a), italics added.) It has given the name ""Unfair Practices Act"" to sections 17000 through 17101 of the Business 
and Professions Code. (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17000.) The Supreme Court has used that name to refer not only to those sections 
but also to section 17200 et seq. ( Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 377, 395 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 487, 826 
P.2d 730]; State of California ex rel.  Van de Kamp v. Texaco, Inc. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 1147, 1169 [252 Cal.Rptr. 221, 762 P.2d 
385]; cf.  Bank of the West v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1260 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545] [describing § 
17200 as part of ""Unfair Business Practices Act""].) To avoid this confusion of terms we will adopt our own nomenclature for the affected statutes. Thus we refer to Insurance Code 
sections 790 through 790.10 as the Unfair Insurance Practices Act (UIPA), Business and Professions Code sections 17000 
through 17101 as the Unfair Business Practices Act (UBPA), and Business and Professions Code sections 17200 through 
17208 as the Unfair Competition Act (UCA). "
964,3," Insurance Code section 790.09 provides: ""No order to cease and desist issued under this article directed to any person or 
subsequent administrative or judicial proceeding to enforce the same shall in any way relieve or absolve such person from any

penalties, fines or forfeitures authorized by law with respect to the methods, acts and practices hereby declared to be unfair or 
deceptive."" (Assem. Bill No. 1530 (1959 Reg. Sess.) § 1; see now Ins. Code, § 790.08.)"
965,5," ""No order of the Commissioner under this Act or order of a court to enforce the same shall in any way relieve or absolve any 
person affected by such order from any liability under any other laws of this state."" (Exhibit B to Rep. of Joint Com. on Federal 
Legislation etc. (Jan. 24, 1947) § 8(d); Proceedings, 78th Ann. Sess., NAIC (1947) p. 398.)"
965,6," In a memorandum to the Governor, the Chief Assistant Insurance Commissioner indicated that the UIPA had been enacted in 
all but one other state and that it was expected to add little if anything to California law. He concluded, ""The Department is 
neither opposed to nor an advocate for this Bill. We know of nothing in the Bill which is detrimental to the public interest."" (J. "
966,," Thomas, Mem. from Dept. of Ins. to Hon. Edmund G. Brown (June 30, 1959) pp. 1-2; exhibit 1 to Request for Judicial Notice 
filed Sept. 20, 1991, in A055038.) A few years later, the same author wrote that the Model Act ""had only a psychological application to states, such as New York 
and California[,] which already had extensive laws regulating practically every phase of the business …. [P] California and some 
of the other active states hesitated [to adopt the Act] because it was difficult to justify the expense and time expenditure of 
enacting and having in the books an Act which, for all practical purposes, was unnecessary."" (J. Thomas, Interdepartmental 
Mem. (May 17, 1960) pp. 1-2; exhibit 3 to Request for Judicial Notice filed Sept. 20, 1991, in A055038.)"
966,7," Statutes are also presumed to be consistent with the common law. ( Dry Creek Valley Assn., Inc. v. Board of Supervisors 
(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 839, 844 [135 Cal.Rptr. 726]; see Rojo v. Kliger (1990) 52 Cal.3d 65, 75 [276 Cal.Rptr. 130, 801 P.2d 
373]; Lacher v. Superior Court (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 1038, 1050 [281 Cal.Rptr. 640], review den.; cf.  I. E. Associates v. Safeco 
Title Ins. Co. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 281, 285 [216 Cal.Rptr. 438, 702 P.2d 596].) In this regard, we observe that plaintiff's antitrust 
claims have their roots in common law. (See Speegle v. Board of Fire Underwriters, supra, 29 Cal.2d at pp. 44, 45, 46.) "
967,8," ""The purpose of this article is to regulate trade practices in the business of insurance in accordance with the intent of Congress 
as expressed in the Act of Congress of March 9, 1945 (Public Law 15, Seventy-ninth Congress), by defining, or providing for the 
determination of, all such practices in this State which constitute unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or 
practices and by prohibiting the trade practices so defined or determined."" (Ins. Code, § 790.) "
968,9," Amici curiae California Chamber of Commerce et al. describe the UIPA as ""answer[ing] a concern expressed by the California 
Supreme Court"" in Speegle v. Board of Fire Underwriters, supra, 29 Cal.2d 34, 45. It is true that the court noted the absence of 
""special legislation"" in this state against combinations in restraint of the insurance trade. But the only ""concern"" expressed in the 
cited passage is the potential effect of denying enforcement of the Cartwright Act in the insurance business. Certainly the court 
had no intention of prognosticating upon the hypothetical preemptive effect of statutes which did not then exist."
968,10," For example: ""We are persuaded … that appellants' vague and conclusionary pleadings fail to allege facts which might 
reasonably be construed to reveal a wrongful combination."" ( Chicago Title Ins. Co. v. Great Western Financial Corp., supra, 69 
Cal.2d at p. 315.) ""[T]he factual allegations, as illustrated, fail in each instance to support the charge. Just as the earlier counts state facts 
insufficient to establish proscribed conduct on the parts of the alleged actors and thus cannot reach their purported conspirators, 
so the final counts charging antitrust infringements fall for similar reasons."" (69 Cal.2d at p. 323, brackets original.) ""The allegation of boycott cannot be supported in this instance because everyone has the unrestricted right to select customers 
and sources of supply."" (69 Cal.3d at p. 324.)"
968,11," ""We must determine … whether the superior court has jurisdiction to entertain an action based upon appellants' theories, or 
any of them, and, if so, whether appellants have stated a cause of action against any of the various named defendants. The 
latter finding, which is determinative, is in the negative."" ( Chicago Title Ins. Co. v. Great Western Financial Corp., supra, 69 
Cal.2d at p. 313, italics added.) "
969,12," Concerning our use of the term ""Unfair Business Practices Act,"" see footnote 2, ante. "
970,13," Apparently failing to discover this solid edifice of adverse sister-state authority, defendants cite only Chick's Auto Body v. State 
Farm, etc. (1979) 168 N.J.Super. 68 [401 A.2d 722], affd.  (1980) 176 N.J.Super. 320 [423 A.2d 311]. That case is patently 
inapposite because it rests on an express exemption from that state's antitrust laws for the activities of insurers "" 'to the extent 
that such activities are subject to regulation by the Commissioner of Insurance.' "" (401 A.2d at p. 724, citing N.J. Stat. Ann. § 
56:9-5, subd. (b)(4).) We can find no fault with the court's analysis. Nor can we find any guidance in it, for this state has no such 
statute. "

978,5," Taylor does not claim that Hollymatic used the tie to effect price discrimination in violation of the Robinson-Patman Act. See 15 
U.S.C. § 13, et seq."
978,6," Hollymatic appeals the district court's denial of its motion to dismiss Taylor's complaint, its motion for summary judgment, its 
motion for judgment as a matter of law, its renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, and its motion for a new trial. See 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), 56, 50(a), 50(b), and 59(a). As a jury ruled on the evidence at trial, we need not consider whether at any 
given stage Hollymatic might have prevailed. We assess instead the propriety of the jury verdict. See, e.g., Bealmer v. Texaco, 
Inc., 427 F.2d 885, 886 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 926, 27 L. Ed. 2d 185, 91 S. Ct. 187 (1970) (refusing to entertain 
appeal of denial of summary judgment after final resolution of case). Compare Savarin Corporation v. National Bank of Pakistan, 
447 F.2d 727, 732 (2d Cir. 1971) (entertaining challenge of denial of summary judgment after final resolution of case) with 
Glaros v. H.H. Robertson Co., 797 F.2d 1564, 1573 (Fed.Cir. 1986) (criticizing Savarin and refusing to entertain appeal of denial 
of summary judgment). Hollymatic provides support only for the contention that it may appeal the district court's denial of its Rule 12(b)(6) and summary 
judgment motions. Hollymatic cites two cases in which we entertained interlocutory appeals of, respectively, denial of a motion 
for summary judgment and of a motion under Rule 12(b)(6), both requested on the basis of qualified immunity. See Spann v. 
Rainey, 987 F.2d 1110, 1112 (5th Cir. 1993); Jackson v. Beaumont Police Dept., 958 F.2d 616, 618 (5th Cir. 1992). Qualified 
immunity provides a rare exception to the general rule that we will not address on appeal a denial of summary judgment. 
Hollymatic offers no grounds for entertaining appeals of motions denied prior to the jury's verdict in cases that do not involve 
qualified immunity."

rule for Hollymatic on other grounds."

of 1993, Plaintiff sought permission to file a Second Amended Complaint. The proposed Second Amended Complaint was 
submitted to the Court on July 29, 1993, but never formally filed with the Clerk of the Court. Following the reassignment of the

994,1, Only Foseco and Fosbel have been served with process. Glaverbel has not and hence is not subject to this Court's jurisdiction. 
995,2," Although neither the SAC nor any of the submissions on the current motion suggest just which jurisdiction's law should supply 
the rules of decision in that last respect, this Court's disposition of Count V renders it unnecessary to address that choice of law 
question."
995,3," Neither side has filed the General Rule 12 statements that are required by this District Court to facilitate the resolution of Rule 
56 motions, though each has submitted evidentiary materials together with its memoranda. All of this opinion's factual recitals 
are therefore gleaned from those memoranda (when properly supported by attached exhibits, deposition testimony or affidavits). 
This opinion refers to only one other submission: Northlake's January 18, 1994 Further Supplemental Response, which will be 
cited as ""F. Supp. Mem.--."" "
996,4," While affidavits are not ordinarily the proper form in which to admit evidence at trial, they are clearly sufficient to meet a 
nonmovant's burden under Rule 56(e) as long as they are ""admissible in content, in the sense that a change in form but not in 
content, for example a substitution of oral testimony for a summary of that testimony in an affidavit, would make the evidence 
admissible at trial"" ( Winskunas, 23 F.3d at 1268)."
996,5," To be more precise, Money Dep. 21 discloses only that ""a Glaverbel Group Company"" is the other shareholder. Because this 
Court has no jurisdiction over Glaverbel anyway, that other shareholder will simply be referred to as Glaverbel for ease of 
designation. "
997,6," No confusion should be engendered by this opinion's dual use of the term ""Rule"" to denote both the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure (all of which bear single-digit or two-digit numbers) and the Federal Rules of Evidence (all of which bear three-digit 
numbers). "
998,7," After all, the other alternative would seem to be that Johnson had fabricated the making of the Goffe-Verdi statements--and 
with what motive, to what end?"
998,8," Exo-Ram is ""an affiliate of Northlake"" (P. Supp. Mem. 5). "
999,9," [Footnote by this Court] As of the parties' last submission in this case (on March 23, 1994) no such suit had been filed. "
1000,10," Northlake's Supp. Mem. 2 suggests that Sherman Act HN4[
] liability may be imposed merely for the fraudulent procurement 
of a patent. That is simply wrong--it must also be shown that the patent has been used after its issuance in an anticompetitive 
fashion ( Brunswick Corp. v. Riegel Textile Corp., 752 F.2d 261, 266 (7th Cir. 1984)). "
1001,11," Northlake and Foseco-Fosbel agree that the British patent referred to in the Press Release corresponds to Glaverbel's United 
States Patent No. 3,684,560--a patent that had expired as of March 31, 1992. That being so, the only United States patents to 
which the Press Release could have referred were one or more of Patents '468, '084 and '022."
1001,12," Northlake's Supp. Mem. 20 argues that because it ""prevailed on Glaverbel's infringement claims under the '022 patent"" in the 
Indiana litigation, the Press Release can logically be referring only to Patents '468 and '084. That contention is seriously 
misleading. In that prior litigation Magistrate Judge Rodovich did grant summary judgment to Northlake on Glaverbel's claim of 
patent infringement, but after a trial on the merits he held that Patent '022 was valid. Thus the statement in the Press Release 
that Glaverbel's ceramic welding process ""is protected throughout the world by patents and commercialized by Fosbel"" cannot 
by any stretch of the imagination be labeled a bad faith assertion. At least as to Patent '022, Glaverbel held and holds a patent 
that enjoys a judicial finding of validity. "
1002,13," Sherman Act § 1's ""restraint of trade"" element is assessed in terms of ""the competitive significance"" of defendant's conduct ( 
National Soc'y of Professional Eng'rs v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 692, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637, 98 S. Ct. 1355 (1978); see also

1087-88 (7th Cir. 1992), quoting Car Carriers, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 745 F.2d 1101, 1107-08 (7th Cir. 1984)). Sherman Act § 2 
also applies a competition-based definition ( United States v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 391, 100 L. Ed. 
1264, 76 S. Ct. 994 (1956)): Monopoly power is the power to control prices or exclude competition. Accord, such cases as American Academic Suppliers. Inc. v. Beckley-Cardy. Inc., 922 F.2d 1317, 1319 (7th Cir. 1991); Indiana 
Grocery, Inc. v. Super Valu Stores, Inc., 864 F.2d 1409, 1414 (7th Cir. 1989)."
1002,14," Fosbel says that it services ovens used by the steel, glass and copper industries, while Northlake's filings mention only its 
repair work of coke ovens used by the steel industry. "
1003,15," This may be somewhat more charitable than Northlake deserves. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325 teaches that: the burden on the moving party [under Rule 56(c)] may be discharged by ""showing""--that is, pointing out to the district 
court--that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case. And Foseco-Fosbel did just that when they said this in their May 26, 1993 memorandum opposing Northlake's motion to vacate 
this Court's earlier grant of summary judgment in favor of Foseco-Fosbel: We are aware of no authority which allows Northlake, in response to summary judgment, to selectively avoid certain issues 
of proof. For example, there is no basis to avoid proof of the relevant market in an antitrust suit. When this Court granted that motion to vacate, Northlake had clearly and specifically been placed on notice of its burden to 
prove the relevant market as part of its antitrust claim. It should really make no difference that Foseco-Fosbel did not advert to 
the issue on the current go-round, for the burden on Northlake never changed--and it was never met. All the same, this Court 
does not (though it well might) rest this opinion on that failure by Northlake. "
1009,*," The Honorable Levin H. Campbell of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, sitting by designation. "
1011,1," On March 8, 1993, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed Vermont Integrated Waste Solutions, Inc."
1011,2," As amended on March 3, 1993, Count I came to read: The contract, ordinance and regulations unconstitutionally discriminate facially and in effect against interstate commerce in 
violation of the ""dormant"" Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution Article I Section 8. Said discrimination on the part of 
the defendant District constitutes a deprivation under color of ordinance and regulation of the plaintiffs' rights, privileges and 
immunities secured by the U.S. Constitution in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. On March 22, 1993, Plaintiffs, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a), moved to amend their complaint again primarily to seek 
declaratory and compensatory damages. See infra part II.A (setting forth the amended paragraph 2 of the complaint). The 
district court granted this motion. Then, on June 3, 1993, Plaintiffs sought leave for a further amendment. This request was 
followed on June 7, 1993, by yet a third motion to amend the complaint -- bringing the total number of amendments or 
requested amendments to four (including the initial amendment as a matter of course). On July 23, 1993, the district court, 
upon granting C.V. Landfill's motion to dismiss and the District's motion for summary judgment, ruled that Plaintiffs' second 
and third motions to amend were moot. "
1012,3," The district court heard, among other things, (1) Plaintiffs' motion to amend their complaint, (2) C.V. Landfill's motion to dismiss, 
(3) the District's motion to dismiss and for summary judgment, and (4) Valley Disposal's cross-motion for summary judgment on 
Counts I and IV."
1012,4," Whether a motion to dismiss an antitrust claim such as that brought by C.V. Landfill is more properly considered under Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 12(b)(1) or Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) is an issue that has divided courts and commentators. See, e.g., Seglin v. Esau, 769 
F.2d 1274, 1278-79 (7th Cir. 1985) (observing that ""at least two commentators and one federal district court have argued 
persuasively that a failure to allege an effect on interstate commerce is a failure to state a claim and not a failure to allege 
subject matter jurisdiction""). Regardless of which rule is preferable, our review is de novo because ""the trial court dismissed on 
the basis of the complaint alone."" Rent Stabilization Ass'n v. Dinkins, 5 F.3d 591, 594 (2d Cir. 1993). "
1013,5," The District joined in C.V. Landfill's motion to dismiss, adopting and incorporating its memoranda in support thereof on all 
issues. Similarly, on appeal, ""the District specifically adopts and incorporates . . . the arguments made by . . . C.V. Landfill . . . as 
to the propriety of the district court's dismissal of the [antitrust] counts."""
1013,6," This court has said HN4[
] there are two ways to establish the interstate commerce component of Sherman Act jurisdiction. First, plaintiff may allege and prove that defendant's conduct is ""within"" the stream of interstate commerce. Goldfarb v. 
Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572 (1975). Alternatively, plaintiff may allege and prove that 
defendant's conduct, although entirely local or confined to one state, nonetheless ""affects"" interstate commerce. United 
States v. Employing Plasterers Association, 347 U.S. 186, 189, 74 S. Ct. 452, 454, 98 L. Ed. 618 (1954). Furlong v. Long Island College Hosp., 710 F.2d 922, 925 (2d Cir. 1983). "
1014,7," The complaint in McLain contained the following allegations pertinent to establishing federal jurisdiction: (1) that the activities of the respondents are ""within the flow of interstate commerce and have an effect upon that 
commerce""; (2) that the services of respondents were employed in connection with the purchase and sale of real estate by ""persons 
moving into and out of the Greater New Orleans area""; (3) that respondents ""assist their clients in securing financing and insurance involved with the purchase of real estate in the 
Greater New Orleans area,"" which ""financing and insurance are obtained from sources outside the State of Louisiana and 
move in interstate commerce into the State of Louisiana through the activities of the [respondents]""; and (4) that respondents have engaged in an unlawful restraint of ""interstate trade and commerce in the offering for sale and 
sale of real estate brokering services."" McLain, 444 U.S. at 235-36. "
1015,8," The district court viewed this third allegation, paragraph thirty-two of the complaint, as the sole suggestion that the District's and 
C.V. Landfill's activities have any nexus to interstate commerce. The district court found, however, and we agree, that this . . . allegation does no more than identify a relevant local activity and ""presume an interrelationship with some 
unspecified aspect of interstate commerce."" McLain, 444 U.S. at 242. It does not support and plaintiffs have not pleaded 
any facts to support an inference that the local activity has a ""not insubstantial effect"" on interstate commerce."
1015,9," Nor did Plaintiffs' subsequent proposed amended complaints of June 3 and June 7, 1993, add any factual allegations that 
would satisfy antitrust jurisdictional requirements."
1015,10," The inadequacy of Plaintiffs' allegations here becomes even more apparent when compared with the jurisdictional allegations 
made by the plaintiffs in McLain, see supra note 7, and by the plaintiff in Furlong. In the latter case, to establish that her claim was cognizable under federal antitrust law, Dr. Furlong alleged several connections between 
the parties' business activities and interstate commerce. The connections specified were Dr. Furlong's receipt of third-party 
payments from out-of-state, [Long Island Anesthesiology Associates'] receipt of such payments, LIAA's practice of 
purchasing goods and services in interstate commerce, and [Long Island College Hospital's] receipt of federal subsidies. Furlong, 710 F.2d at 924. "
1016,11," Plaintiffs asserted in their March 11, 1993, Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' Motions to Dismiss that they would 
show at the March 11, 1993, ""preliminary injunction hearing that the jurisdictional threshold for the application of the [Sherman 
Act] is met here."""
1016,12," Plaintiffs have not argued that they can gain relief from Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b). Rule 15(b) provides that ""when issues not raised 
by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been 
raised in the pleadings."" In any event, we would reject such an argument under present circumstances. The case has yet to go 
to trial, and we do not think a district court must accept evidence submitted by a plaintiff at a preliminary hearing as automatically 
amending an inadequate complaint. Cf. Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 
1494, at 53 (1990) (""If the issue in fact has not been tried with the consent of the parties, then an amendment to conform to the 
pleadings will not be permitted no matter when made.""). "
1017,13," For a thorough discussion of Marrese, see 18 Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and 
Procedure § 4470, at 443-49 (1993 Supp.). "
1018,14," ""This variance request was denied by the board and an appeal was taken to the Caledonia County Court which affirmed the 
board's decision."" Pike Indus., 373 A.2d at 529. In L. M. Pike & Son, Inc. v. Town of Waterford, 130 Vt. 432, 296 A.2d 262 (Vt. 
1972), the Supreme Court of Vermont affirmed the county court's decision."
1018,15," By virtue of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, § 4473, ""the board is precluded . . . from invalidating any development plan or bylaw of any 
municipality or the implementation or enforcement thereof."" Pike Indus., 373 A.2d at 529."
1018,16," Although Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, § 4472(a) ""currently provides for a de novo hearing before the superior court, at the time that 
Pike took its appeal to the county court this provision was not in effect."" Pike Indus., 373 A.2d at 530. "
1020,17," Indicative of the District's intent that C.V. Landfill would construct a lined landfill was paragraph 3 of the Interim Disposal 
Agreement, which read: During the initial term of this agreement, Operator shall provide disposal capacity (until exhausted or prohibited) for District 
waste, only at its unlined facility. In anticipation of exhaustion of unlined capacity, Operator will commence to permit and 
prepare for construction [of] materials processing and long-term disposal facilities consisting of a source separated organic 
waste composting process and lined landfill cell . . . . (emphasis added)."
1020,18," The district court did not find this distinction compelling. It held that ""the fact that the state court action pertained to the unlined 
landfill and this action pertains to a lined landfill does not alter the Court's opinion that the issues before us, i.e., the legality of 
the District's actions under state law and the Commerce Clause, are identical to the issues previously contested in state court."" "
1021,19," The Supreme Court had not yet decided C & A Carbone when Plaintiffs submitted their briefs. They cited it, however, as a 
case that involves facts very similar to those here, and as a decision that could potentially strengthen their dormant Commerce 
Clause claim."
1021,20," Indeed, the renewal agreement states: Paragraph 3. is deleted and is replaced by the following Paragraph 3.:"
1021,3," . During the first renewed term of this Agreement, Operator shall provide disposal capacity (until exhausted or prohibited) 
for District waste, only at its unlined facility. In anticipation of exhaustion or prohibition of unlined capacity, Operator will 
continue its efforts to permit and prepare for construction of a materials processing and long-term disposal facility consisting 
of a lined landfill cell . . . . If Operator is prohibited by law from disposal of solid waste at its unlined facility, and in any event 
at a time no later than October 9, 1993, Operator will provide the District transfer services to a lined facility, effective 
immediately upon closure of the unlined facility. . . ."
1021,21," Plaintiffs described these new events and this new claim, among others, in their proffered amended complaint of June 7, 1993. 
The district court disallowed the amendment, apparently believing that its dismissal of the complaint as earlier amended 
rendered the new claim moot. Upon remand, the district court is instructed to allow Plaintiffs' to amend their complaint to include 
their updated allegations and claims. "
1022,22," Were the district court free to write on a clean slate, it might have relied on a theory other than the alter ego doctrine to satisfy 
the first element of Vermont's Trepanier test (i.e., ""preclusion is asserted against one who was a party or in privity with a party in 
the earlier action,"" 583 A.2d at 587). While HN16[
] the traditional test for privity -- ""whether the parties have really and 
substantially the same interest in the property in issue,"" First Wis. Mortgage Trust v. Wyman's, Inc., 139 Vt. 350, 428 A.2d 1119, 
1124 (Vt. 1981) -- might not have yielded any clear result one way or the other, the district court might have looked to ""some 
recent decisions [that] have stretched traditional doctrine and allowed collateral estoppel to be used against nonparties in some 
situations,"" Hiroshi Motomura, Using Judgments as Evidence, 70 Minn. L. Rev. 979, 1026 (1986). The ""virtual representation"" 
doctrine, for example, which says ""that a nonparty is bound if a party who had the same interests litigated the prior case, even 
though the nonparty was neither a participant nor in privity with a party in the prior proceeding,"" id. at 1029, might apply if it were 
found ""that . . . two corporations were taking advantage of their corporate separateness in order to sue [the same defendant] 
twice,"" American Renaissance Lines, Inc. v. Saxis S.S. Co., 502 F.2d 674, 678 (2d Cir. 1974). "
1023,23," Chapter 159 is entitled ""Waste Management,"" and its purpose is to HN20[
] provide technical and financial leadership to municipalities for the siting of solid waste management facilities and 
the implementation of a program for the management and reduction of wastes that over the long term is sustainable, 
environmentally sound, and economically beneficial, and that encourages innovation and individual responsibility. The 
program should give priority to reducing the waste stream through recycling and through the reduction of nonbiodegradable 
and hazardous ingredients. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, § 6601(5) (Supp. 1992). "
1024,24, Valley Disposal was actually specified as the moving party. 
1035,1," Amici consist of the Computer Dealers and Lessors Association, Inc. Digital Dealers Association, and National Association of 
Telecommunications Dealers."
1035,2," Although upon review we concentrate on errors, it is well to say at the outset that in a case that has been litigated as vigorously 
as this one, either finding facts or reviewing those findings for clear error is no easy task. The thirty-volume record on appeal 
contains 17,469 pages of court filings, trial and deposition transcripts, and exhibits. The district court, of course, was in even a 
more difficult position. Over 3.5 million pages of discovery documents were produced and 65 days of deposition testimony were 
taken. The trial transcript alone fills 1,750 pages, there were 2,750 pages of deposition testimony admitted, and there were no 
fewer than 734 trial exhibits. "
1036,3," IBM itself is barred from leasing computers to end users under the terms of a 1956 consent decree entered into with the United 
States in another antitrust case."
1036,4," An ""X"" in an IBM model number indicates that several numerical designators may be used in that position, e.g., 3031, 3033. "
1037,5," In addition, AMI alleged that IBM's Installation and Warranty Service Charge (IWSC) constituted an unreasonable restraint of 
trade. The district court found for IBM on this theory, and AMI has not appealed from that finding."
1037,6, The district court's decision under the rule of reason has not been appealed.
1037,7," AMI later moved for reconsideration, but that motion was denied.  Allen-Myland, Inc. v. IBM Corp., 770 F. Supp. 1004 (E.D. Pa. 
1991). "
1038,8," ""The outer boundaries of a product market are determined by the reasonable interchangeability of use or the cross-elasticity of 
demand between the product itself and substitutes for it."" Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 325, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 
1523-24, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1962). "
1040,9," Conceivably, a few large, sophisticated buyers could place certain limits on even a dominant seller's power to set prices. There 
is no evidence that such pressure was applied here."
1040,10," Although Alcoa was decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the procedural circumstances under 
which it reached that court give it added weight as precedent. Under the then-existing version of 15 U.S.C. § 29, appeals from 
the decrees of district courts in antitrust cases where the United States was a complainant would lie only to the Supreme Court. 
In Alcoa, however, a sufficient number of justices were recused that a quorum could not be obtained; accordingly, the Supreme 
Court, pursuant to the above statute, remanded the case to the three most senior judges of the Second Circuit: Learned Hand 
(the author of Alcoa), Augustus N. Hand, and Swan. The Supreme Court itself has recognized the special weight of the Alcoa 
opinion. See American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 811-13 & n.10, 66 S. Ct. 1125, 1140 & n.10, 90 L. Ed. 1575 
(1946)."
1040,11," Moreover, IBM's net pricing and parts recapture policies further reduced whatever control the leasing companies might have 
had over the prices of used equipment. By recapturing old parts from upgraded mainframes, IBM effectively curtailed the leasing 
companies' ability to reconfigure their used machines into different models that could have competed against IBM's offerings 
over the medium term. This effect is similar to that caused by IBM's past practices of offering tabulating and computer equipment 
only for lease and not for sale. These practices also spawned antitrust litigation, resulting in a 1935 injunction and a 1956 
consent decree. See Control Data Corp. v. IBM Corp., 306 F. Supp. 839 (D. Minn. 1969), aff'd, 430 F.2d 1277 (8th Cir. 1970)."
1040,12," We also disagree with the district court's view that AMI admitted that leasing companies ""compete with IBM and constrain 
IBM's ability to set prices or exclude competition in the market for new large scale main frame computers."" Allen-Myland, 693 F. 
Supp. at 274. The district court cited AMI's proposed finding of fact 29 in support of its conclusion, but AMI asserted only that 
IBM and lessors compete in the placement of mainframes with end users; in other words, IBM installs computers, and so do 
Comdisco and CMI. This does not constitute an admission on market cross-elasticity or the scope of the relevant market. "
1041,13," Indeed, the so-called ""plug-compatible manufacturers"" have built their businesses around providing mainframes and 
peripherals compatible with, but in competition with those of IBM."
1041,14," This holds most true for plug-compatible mainframes. There is actually a considerable question to what extent non-compatible 
computers are a realistic short-run alternative for a customer whose computer software and data are tailored to IBM mainframes. 
We do not reach the issue, however, as Allen-Myland is constrained by its own definition of the market as ""large scale 
mainframe computers,"" regardless of manufacturer or compatibility. See Edward J. Sweeney & Sons, Inc. v. Texaco, Inc., 637 
F.2d 105, 117 (3d Cir. 1980) (antitrust plaintiff held to theory advanced in district court), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 911, 101 S. Ct. 
1981, 68 L. Ed. 2d 300 (1981). "
1043,15," If it does so, the district court should then proceed to determine the percentage of the mainframe market occupied by existing 
mainframe users who are locked in to that type of computer by prohibitively high switching costs; the greater that percentage is, 
the more power IBM has to maintain supracompetitive prices in the mainframe market. See Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert 
Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 521.1a, at 604-05 (1993 Supp.). The court can then determine if IBM's power in the large-scale 
mainframe market is constrained by the existence of smaller capacity computers, and if so, whether such computers should be 
included in the relevant market. It may be that the district court will conclude that, while smaller capacity computers cannot be 
fully excluded from the market, neither can they be fully included. The court may, after considering the evidence and the nature 
of the market, exercise its discretion and reduce IBM's market share by a number greater than zero percent but less that the full 
extent of the market for smaller capacity computers. "
1045,16," The use of the term ""submarket"" is somewhat confusing, and tends to obscure the true inquiry: whether IBM is constrained by 
the prices of large scale mainframe computers when pricing its upgrades. If it is so constrained, then the relevant market 
consists of both mainframes and upgrades. If not, then it is simpler and more accurate to say that the relevant market itself, not 
some submarket of it, contains only upgrades. See Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, P 581.1c, at 535-36 (1993 Supp.). 
Nevertheless, because the term has been commonly used in the reported cases over the years, we will also continue to use it, 
being nonetheless mindful that it is inaccurate and of the true question before us. "
1046,17," We do not accept the district court's alternative reason for discrediting the SWLRs. Although it may well be true that in some 
circumstances non-IBM mainframes competed with smaller IBM computers, we must be aware of the true market inquiry in an 
antitrust tying case: can the defendant exercise market power over the tying product to restrain trade in the tied product market? 
Although the above evidence could lead to the conclusion that the relevant market here is somewhat broader than mainframes 
only, a user seeking to avoid IBM's tie needs an alternative to an upgrade or a computer of the type it currently has installed. To 
the extent that the user needs more computing power, a smaller IBM computer would not appear to be much of a substitute. "
1048,18," We do not, however, hold as a matter of law that price reductions and technological improvements can never evidence a lack 
of market power. Each case must be decided on its own facts, and facts must be found on the evidence presented. "
1049,19," We again stress, however, that we cannot and will not substitute our view of the facts for that of the district court. We hold only 
that the district court's finding of fact is not adequately supported by the elaboration contained in its opinion. On remand, the 
court may of course re-examine this issue and again reach the same conclusion, if it is supported by sufficient evidence and 
findings of fact. "
1050,20," 308X model numbers appear to be classified as follows: 308X-YMM; where X is the CPU family, e.g., 3081, 3083, 3084; Y is 
the CPU power indicator within the family, e.g., 3081-J, 3081-K; and MM is the main memory in megabytes, e.g., 3081-J16, 
3081-J24. This is consistent with the numbering scheme for memory upgrades in DX 2266. "
1051,21," In addition, the district court relied on the fact that the SWRPQ procedure has existed since 1975, that ""SWRPQ prices are 
readily available from IBM,"" and that AMI acknowledged this fact. This all appears to be true, in general, but there is no 
indication in the portions of the record cited by the court below that these facts impeached the testimony of the Comdisco and 
CMI witnesses that they were unaware of SWRPQ-priced MIPS upgrades for 308X series computers. That these prices were 
available for memory upgrades and for earlier series of computers could not have reasonably put these witnesses on notice that 
a very small number of SWRPQ-priced MIPS upgrades were made available for the 308X series, given IBM's well-publicized 
policy of net pricing. "
1052,22," Earlier in its opinion, the district court found that Allen had admitted that AMI could not make a profit on a labor value of 1.2 
percent of the net upgrade price.  Allen-Myland, 693 F. Supp. at 284. The trial testimony shows that counsel for IBM asked Allen 
whether he would take on an upgrade for $ 25,500 labor charge when the net price was $ 2,090,000, a 1.2% margin. Allen 
replied that he would, and that he thought it was a viable business opportunity. Counsel then tried to impeach him with a letter 
he wrote to IBM in the context of settlement negotiations. On the witness stand, Allen admitted the existence of this letter but 
claimed that counsel was taking it out of context. We do not think this letter can be fairly read to concede that AMI could never 
make a profit on a 1.2 percent margin. Like the statement discussed in the above text, it admits no more than that, to the extent 
AMI must buy and inventory the parts, it cannot earn a profit on that margin. "
1056,*," Of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 294(d). "
1062,1," Judge Brotman is a United States District Court Judge for the District of New Jersey and was temporarily assigned to the 
United States District Court for the District of the Virgin Islands."
1062,2," ""A dissolved corporation or successor entity * * * shall pay or make reasonable provision to pay all claims and obligations, 
including all contingent, conditional, or unmatured claims known to the corporation or such successor entity and all claims which 
are known to the dissolved corporation or such successor entity but for which the identity of the claimant is unknown. Such 
claims shall be paid in full and any such provision for payment made shall be made in full if there are sufficient funds. If there are 
insufficient funds, such claims and obligations shall be paid or provided for according to their priority and, among claims of equal 
priority, ratably to the extent of funds legally available therefor. Any remaining funds shall be distributed to the stockholders of 
the dissolved corporation."""
1062,3," According to counsel for the defendants, the Delaware hearing is set for October 4th."
1062,4," Defense counsel Zuckerman stated at the July 8th oral argument that the defendants might expend some trust assets (not 
exceeding $ 100,000 or so) if such were needed as a ""deal closer"" should the defendants' insurers agreed to pay most but not 
all of the $ 890,000 Four Winds settlement. Trust funds also will be expended for ongoing attorneys' fees, but plaintiffs' counsel 
Gordon stated at the oral argument that the plaintiffs do not seek to enjoin the payment of such. "
1064,5," The plaintiffs argue that an expenditure of assets by the defendants in the Four Winds settlement would constitute an illegality 
because Delaware law requires that the assets of a dissolved corporation be ratably distributed but, as mentioned, whether 
Delaware law so requires in this instance is not clear and the defendants have assured this Court they will not act until this 
question shall have been decided in Delaware. However, if it is there ruled that ratable distribution is required and if the 
defendants thereafter manifest an intention to act contrary to that ruling, this Court would be willing, at the least, to entertain a 
renewed preliminary injunction motion. "
1065,6," Although the plaintiffs do not mention it, there is a split among the United States Courts of Appeal as to the extent of the 
exceptions allowable under De Beers. Compare, e.g., ITT Community Development Corp. v. Barton, 569 F.2d 1351 (5th Cir. 
1978), and Rosen v. Cascade Intern., Inc., 21 F.3d 1520 (11th Cir. 1994), both of which narrowly read the exceptions allowable 
under De Beers, with Hoxworth v. Blinder, Robinson & Co., Inc., 903 F.2d 186 (3rd Cir. 1990), and Teradyne, Inc. v. Mostek 
Corp., 797 F.2d 43 (1st Cir. 1986), both of which expand the exceptions. Teradyne is particularly relevant to the plaintiffs' 
argument (although they did not cite it) because it characterized Deckert, supra, as holding that ""a preliminary injunction, 
designed to freeze the status quo and protect the damages remedy is an appropriate form of relief when it is shown that the 
defendant is likely to be insolvent at the time of judgment."" Teradyne, 797 F.2d at 52. However, as mentioned this is a 
misreading of Deckert in light of De Beers's characterization of Deckert (i.e., that insolvency vel non was not material to its 
decision), and we agree with the criticism of these cases by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit that 
allowing such expansive exceptions ""tortures the express language of De Beers and runs counter to established equitable 
principles."" Rosen, 21 F.3d at 1529. Further, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has never allowed such 
exceptions."
1065,7," The plaintiffs do allege joint and several liability, but they have made no suggestion that the other defendants would be unable 
to satisfy their respective liabilities."
1065,8," At oral argument, counsel agreed that there could be a cross-utilization of discovered evidence -- viz., that what may be 
discovered herein may be used in the Delaware's Chancery Court and vice versa. "
1070,1, Plaintiff did not include a copy of the settlement agreement with the complaint. 
1072,2," See, e.g. Gregory Marketing Corp. v. Wakefern Food Corp., 787 F.2d 92, 96 (3d. Cir. 1986) (the view that discharged 
employees have antitrust standing generally rejected); Rafferty v. Nynex Corp., 744 F. Supp. 324 (D.D.C. 1990) (most courts 
which have considered the issue in Ostrofe have rejected the holding); Boisjoly v. Morton Thiokol, Inc., 706 F. Supp. 795, 805 
(D. Utah 1988) (""Ostrofe's holding is . . . contrary to virtually all other decisions addressing the issue.""); Winther V. DEC Int'l, 
Inc., 625 F. Supp. 100, 103 (D. Colo. 1985) (""Nothing in Associated General Contractors supports [Ostrofe's] interpretation of the 
scope of antitrust law.""). "
1073,3," Ostrofe first reached the Ninth Circuit in 1982 where the court found standing.  Ostrofe v. H.S. Crocker Co., 670 F.2d 1378 (9th 
Cir. 1982) (""Ostrofe I""). The Supreme Court vacated this holding and remanded ""for further consideration in light of [AGC]."" 460 
U.S. 1007 (1983). On remand, the ninth circuit noted that AGC did not dictate reversal even if the court had ""expanded"" the 
concept of ""antitrust injury"" too broadly.  Ostrofe, 740 F.2d at 746. This conclusion was predicated on a footnote in the majority 
opinion of AGC which reserved the question ""of whether the direct victim of a boycott, who suffers a type of injury unrelated to 
antitrust policy, may recover damages when the ultimate purpose of the boycott is to restrain competition in the relevant 
economic market."" Id. (quoting AGC, 103 S. Ct. at 910 n.44). "
1074,4," See also Vinci, No. 957805 at 2."
1074,5," HN9[
]  15 U.S.C. § 1 requires a claimant to allege and prove three elements: ""(1) an agreement or conspiracy among two or more persons or distinct business entities; (2) by which the persons or entities intend to harm or restrain competition; (3) which 
actually injures competition."" Les Shockley Racing, Inc. v. National Hot Rod Ass'n, 884 F.2d 504, 507 (9th Cir. 1989). "
1080,1," Plaintiff brought his antitrust claims under both state and federal statutes. The New Mexico antitrust statute, NMSA 1978, § 57-
1-15, is construed in harmony with the federal law. Hence, the Court's conclusions as to the federal antitrust claims apply equally 
to the state claims."
1080,2," Plaintiff also brought claims of defamation and tortious interference with contractual relations. Those claims were addressed in 
an opinion dated May 18, 1994."
1080,3," Additional facts are contained in the May 18, 1994 opinion. "
1082,4," In this case, just as in Jefferson Parish, the provision of anesthesia services at the hospital is a medical service which is 
separate from the other services provided by St. Joseph. "
1083,5," For 1990, total discharges for St. Joseph medical-surgical, obstetrics, and pediatrics were 14,700. Among the four non-federal 
hospitals, this represents a 21.4 percent market share. Total outpatient surgeries for 1990 were 9,263, representing a 26.9 
percent market share for the non-federal hospitals. Adding the raw numbers together results in a total of 23,963 patients in need 
of hospital services which require anesthesiology. St. Joseph's figures for actual cases where anesthesiology was administered 
is 22,480. "
1086,6," Both the monopolization and attempt to monopolize claims are disposed of. As is made clear by the Supreme Court's decision 
in Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 122 L. Ed. 2d 247, 113 S. Ct. 884 (1993), both claims require an adequate showing of "
1087,," relevant market. As stated in Spectrum Sports, ""demonstrating the dangerous probability of monopolization in an attempt case . . 
. requires inquiry into the relevant product and geographic market and the defendant's economic power in that market."" Id. at 
892. Because no such showing has been made by Plaintiff, summary judgment is appropriate on both claims. "
1088,7," The specific facts cited to by Leyba in an effort to defeat summary judgment are as follows: ""Members of the St. Joseph 
administration, including Kirk and Dr. Floyd, had numerous meetings and other communications with Dr. Renger and other ASA 
anesthesiologists about dealing with the D.O. anesthesiologists practicing at Heights General. There were numerous 
communications among Mr. Kirk, Dr. Duncan, and Dr. Renger concerning Dr. Leyba's participation in the ASA group. The St. 
Joseph administration had numerous meetings and communications with members of its medical staff concerning the Heights 
General acquisition and how to deal with the heavily osteopathic medical staff already credentialed there."" Plaintiffs 
Counterstatement of Material Facts, P 12; Memorandum on Group Boycott. "
1089,8," As noted earlier, Plaintiff does not assert a relevant geographic market of a single hospital. "
1117,1," Non-core customers can choose to become ""elected core"" customers and have the utility procure a specified quantity of gas for 
them as part of the core market. This ensures a steady supply, but reduces a non-core customer's flexibility in negotiating 
alternative sources of supply."
1117,2," ""Spot gas"" is supplied under short-term contracts, usually of less than thirty days duration. In comparison, ""long-term gas"" is 
gas supplied over an extended period of time, such as the twenty-five year A&S contracts. P 34. Spot gas is generally less 
expensive than gas purchased under long-term contracts. Id. "
1120,3," The filed rate doctrine is distinguishable from antitrust immunity, a doctrine invoked by several cases cited by plaintiffs. 
Compare, Arkansas Louisiana Gas. Co. v. Hall, 453 U.S. 571, 577, 101 S. Ct. 2925, 2930, 69 L. Ed. 2d 856 (1981) (barring 
claims under filed rate doctrine to dispute involving seller of natural gas), with, Otter Tail Power Co. v. U.S., 410 U.S. 366, 35 L. 
Ed. 2d 359, 93 S. Ct. 1022 (1973) (no general antitrust immunity exists under National Gas Act). "
1122,4," When PG&E presented the filed rate argument in the CPUC proceedings, the CPUC relied on the Pike County exception in 
rejecting PG&E's argument, stating: ""PG&E applies the filed-rate doctrine too broadly. The doctrine does not preclude a state 
agency from reviewing whether a utility made reasonable purchasing decisions, even though it may not review the FERC-
approved wholesale rate."" Re Pacific Gas and Electric Co., 135 PUR 4th 424, 432 (CPUC July 22, 1992). "
1125,5," In 1989, the Department of Energy transferred authority over the natural gas import and authorization program from the ERA to 
the Office of Fossil Energy (""FE""). Delegation Order 0204-127, 54 Fed. Reg. 11436 (1989) (Defendants Appendix, Tab 13). "
1133,6," Southern Motor Carriers stated: If more detail than a clear intent to displace competition were required of the legislature, States would find it difficult to 
implement through regulatory agencies their anticompetitive policies. Agencies are created because they are able to deal 
with problems unforeseeable to, or outside the competence of, the legislature. Requiring express authorization for every 
action that an agency might find necessary to effectuate state policy would diminish, if not destroy, its usefulness. Id. at 64, 105 S. Ct. at 1730-31. "
1134,7," Defendants also cite DFW Metro Line v. Southwestern Bell, 988 F.2d 601 (5th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 864, 114 S. 
Ct. 183, 126 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1993), for the proposition that a legislative delegation to fix just and reasonable rates is sufficient to 
meet the clear articulation prong. But the state delegating statute at issue in DFW Metro expressly stated: "
1135,," The legislature finds that public utilities are by definition monopolies in the area they serve; that therefore normal forces of 
competition which operate to regulate prices in the free enterprise society do not operate; and therefore utility rates, 
operations, and services are regulated by public agencies with the objective that such regulation shall operate as a 
substitute for competition. DFW Metro Line, 988 F.2d at 605 (emphasis added). No comparable California statute has been cited or found. "
1153,1," At the October 14, 1993 hearing on this motion for summary judgment, Imaging withdrew its Robinson-Patman Act claim of 
discriminatory pricing, Picker v. Leavitt, No. 87-2828, Summary Judgment Hearing, Transcript at 10 (Oct. 14, 1993) (""October 
14, 1993 Tr.""). "
1154,2," HN3[
] Section 2 of the Sherman Act makes it illegal to ""monopolize, or attempt to monopolize . . . any part of the trade or commerce among the several States. . . ."" "
1156,3," The court notes that claims similar to those alleged by Imaging were made against Picker by another ISO in Electronics in 
Medicine, Inc. v. Picker Int'l, Inc., C.A. No. H-88-1400 (S.D. Tex. Nov. 8, 1991). On a motion for summary judgment by Picker, 
the court found that a jury could reasonably find a single brand market with respect to the service of Picker CT Scanners, and 
that Picker had used its unique position as manufacturer in order to eliminate competition at the service market level. Picker's 
Appendix of Authorities, (""Auth. App.""), Ex. 3 at 7. Therefore, the court denied the motion for summary judgment. Id. at 7-8. The 
jury, however, ultimately found that no single brand market for the service of Picker CT Scanners existed. Imaging's Appendix of "
1157,," Exhibits (""Imaging App.""), Ex. 20 at 1. Picker, therefore, prevailed on plaintiff's antitrust claims, although not on its claims of 
tortious interference with advantageous relationships. "
1158,4," There is no direct evidence that Imaging lost a VA award because it lacked access to the Dunlee tube. This fact, however, 
relates only to Imaging's potential damages and not to whether Picker violated Section 2 -- a question which focuses on injury to 
competition rather than to a specific competitor. See, e.g., Town of Concord, 915 F.2d at 21."
1158,5," Imaging lost a Veterans Administration contract in Los Angeles, California because its representatives were not trained by 
Picker. VA Memorandum on Technical Evaluation of Imaging Equipment Services, Imaging App., Ex. B to Ex. 1; Quinn Aff.; 
Imaging App., Ex. 1, PP 13-14. "
1163,6," Picker, for purposes of this motion for summary judgment, has accepted as true Imaging's claim that it entered into the alleged 
exclusive agreements. Picker's Mem. of Law at 46 n.33. "
1164,7," As described, infra, there is inadequate evidence to prove that misconduct by Picker caused Imaging to lose the St. Francis 
Medical Center contract. "
1165,8," The instance in which Quinn states he was told by Picker that he would have to wait 26 weeks for a replacement part involved 
a Picker CT Scanner at Computer Design Associates. Quinn Aff., Imaging App., Ex. 1, P 2. "
1170,*," The HONORABLE HARRY W. WELLFORD, Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation. "
1171,1," The Honorable D. Brook Bartlett, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri."
1171,2," Willman named as defendants ten physicians who had staff privileges at one or both of the defendant hospitals. The defendant 
physicians are Andres, Beheler, Craig, and Weinand (general surgeons), Krueger, McDonald, McMillen, Mullican, and Stuber 
(internists), and Lockard (gastroenterologist). "
1174,3," Recognizing that the possibility of antitrust liability may impede effective peer review, Congress enacted the Health Care 
Quality Improvement Act of 1986.  42 U.S.C. §§ 11101-11152. The Act immunizes medical peer review from antitrust liability if 
the challenged action is taken ""in the reasonable belief that [it] was in the furtherance of quality health care."" Id. § 11112(a). We 
need not consider the impact of the Act on Willman's claims, for the Act was enacted after the events at issue in this case and is 
not retroactive."
1174,4," Approximately sixty-five physicians participated in the review and evaluation of Willman. Willman claims that forty-three of the 
reviewers were his competitors because they practiced in one or more of the areas in which Willman practiced: general surgery, "
1175,," urology, gynecology, gastroenterology, and internal medicine. We express no opinion on whether Willman has properly defined 
his competitors. "
1183,1," Clearly, the parties do not agree on the facts as they relate to the underlying claims in the state case. However, these 
disagreements do not appear to be material to the determination of whether the claims against petitioner must be arbitrated. "
1185,2," Because the parties had not, in their original briefs, discussed substantive reasons concerning whether antitrust claims should 
or should not be considered arbitrable, this Court, on July 7, 1994, ordered the parties to brief the issue. Although the parties 
filed supplemental briefs, respondent's brief provides absolutely no reasons to this Court for finding antitrust claims non-
arbitrable, contrary to the Order. Instead, respondent merely rehashes the argument in its original brief that Mitsubishi did not 
expressly overrule American Safety. Perhaps counsel for respondent agrees with the holding in Nghiem and the criticisms of 
American Safety included in Mitsubishi. The brief provides no counter-argument, presumably relying on the arguments in 
American Safety itself as sufficient rebuttal. Perhaps, respondent is also relying also on the dissent in Mitsubishi, although it 
never refers to the legislative history and policy arguments raised by the dissent in opposing the arbitrability of federal antitrust 
claims. "
1190,1," Defendants correctly point out that in our previous opinion of March 26, 1993, we ruled that no other litigation could serve as a 
basis for plaintiffs' charge of malicious prosecution. Thus, we consider the malicious prosecution claim only insofar as it is based 
on the February 1990 declaratory judgment action."
1190,2," Also pending is the motion of the Elk Crossing defendants for summary judgment. However, due to repeated extensions in the 
briefing schedule, that motion is not yet fully briefed and thus is not considered by the court at this time."
1190,3," As the Seventh Circuit explained in Indiana Grocery v. Super Valu Stores, 864 F.2d 1409 (7th Cir. 1989), ""While sections 1 
and 2 of the Sherman Act focus on competitive conditions in the marketplace as a whole, . . . section 4 of the Clayton Act 
focuses on the type of injury claimed by a particular plaintiff and demands that it be an 'antitrust injury.'"" Id. at 1419 (emphasis in "
1191,," original). The Seventh Circuit elaborated further on this important distinction: ""It is tempting when performing an antitrust injury 
analysis to look first at the substantive antitrust provision the defendant allegedly has violated, to note next the harmful effects on 
competition the substantive provision is designed to prevent, to note further that some of those harmful effects might fall on 
parties such as the plaintiff, and to conclude, therefore, that the plaintiff should have standing to vindicate the substantive 
antitrust provision."" Such an approach, according to the Seventh Circuit, ""stand[s] the antitrust injury inquiry on its head."" Id. at 
1419 n. 6. "
1193,4," Fear of opening the floodgates was obviously a motivating factor behind the Sixth Circuit's denial of standing in Southaven. 
The Sixth Circuit worried that if it were to permit the shopping center landlord to sue the vacating grocery store for damages 
predicated upon diminished lease revenue resulting from reduced consumer activity at his shopping center, it would also have to 
grant standing to the other lessees as well, predicated upon their diminished sales. Southaven, 715 F.2d at 1088 n.12. In Alpha 
Shoe Service v. Fleming Companies, 849 F.2d 352 (8th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 942 (1988), the Eighth Circuit rejected 
just such a suit brought by shopping center tenants against a grocery store anchor tenant who vacated its space and left it empty 
for an extended period of time. The court declined to adopt plaintiffs' broad characterization of the relevant market as ""the 
attraction of consumers,"" and found that the tenants lacked standing because they ""were not competitors, participants, or "
1194,," consumers in the relevant market."" Id. at 354. The court rejected plaintiffs' broad definition of the market for fear of ""expanding 
the scope of the private antitrust action far beyond its intended bounds."" Id."
1194,5," Responding to the emphasis in the case law and defendants' memorandum in support of their motion for summary judgment 
on the market status of an antitrust plaintiff, Serfecz also resorts to the argument that he is in fact a consumer in the market 
because he shops for groceries in Elk Grove Village, and that, in order to sustain his shopping center, he is ""willing"" to become a 
competitor in the market by opening his own grocery store in the Grove Mall. Plaintiffs' Response at 7. However, the antitrust 
allegations in the complaint frame this case as a suit to remedy the injuries suffered by Serfecz as the owner of a competing 
shopping mall, not the injuries he may have suffered as a grocery consumer or prospective grocery store competitor. Thus, we 
reject Serfecz's last ditch efforts to obtain standing by re-casting his case in a manner unsupported by the complaint. "
1196,6," In arguing the motion for summary judgment brought by Jewel and American Stores, the parties have made no attempt to 
distinguish the situation of Jewel from that of its property manager and sister company, American Stores. Apparently, the parties 
view the role of these two defendants as identical. Therefore, even though very little information has been provided to the court 
regarding American Stores, as distinguished from Jewel, we assume that its responsibility for the alleged antitrust activities is the 
same of that of Jewel, and we treat it identically for purposes of this motion for summary judgment. "
1197,7," Indeed, defendants, themselves, at one point acknowledge that Jewel might be found liable for antitrust violations in the 
market for retail shopping centers on a conspiracy theory. See Defendants' Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary 
Judgment (""Defendants' Memorandum"") at 12 n.1. (""Because Jewel does not compete in the market for retail shopping centers . 
. . Jewel cannot be found to have monopolized . . . this market. . . . Jewel can only be found liable on a monopolization theory in 
this market by virtue of a conspiracy."") "
1198,8," We note also that what few arguments plaintiffs do advance regarding the existence of a conspiracy concern only Jewel and 
the Elk Crossing defendants and United Skates; no attempt has been made by plaintiffs to suggest that their claim of a Section 1 
violation might be based on a conspiracy between Jewel and its sister company, American Stores. In fact, as discussed earlier, "
1199,," supra note 6, very little at all has been said by either party about American Stores. Thus, we do not address whether evidence of 
such a conspiracy would constitute a proper basis for a Section 1 claim."
1199,9," Plaintiffs complain repeatedly of delays in production of various discovery materials and their inability to take the deposition of 
defendant Patrick F. Daly, real estate developer and president of the beneficial owner of the Elk Crossing Mall. Yet, it was upon 
plaintiffs' own motion that the court agreed to consider this motion on an expedited basis. See order of June 29, 1994. Thus, it 
would be difficult for plaintiffs now to argue that the matter was not yet ripe for summary judgment due to incomplete discovery. 
However, we can make no definitive assessment regarding the status of discovery because on October 20, 1993, we referred all 
discovery disputes to the designated Magistrate-Judge. If, after additional discovery, plaintiffs are able to present evidence in 
support of their conspiracy claim, and can demonstrate why this evidence was not available earlier, we would be willing to 
entertain a motion to reconsider. "
1200,10," Defendants might argue that because plaintiffs lack standing to sue for the underlying antitrust violations, plaintiffs also lack 
standing to sue for breach of the unlawful use covenant based on these antitrust violations. However, plaintiffs' standing as 
lessors to sue on the lease is independent of the question of standing to sue on the underlying violations. For example, even 
though a lessor lacks standing to prosecute his tenant for operation of a drug dealership or gambling ring on the leased 
premises under the criminal code, he could sue for breach of an unlawful use covenant in the lease. Indeed, defendants appear 
to concede that plaintiffs have standing to bring exactly this type of suit. Defendants' Memorandum at 23. Applying similar 
reasoning, we believe plaintiffs have standing to sue for breach of the lease based on their tenant's alleged illegal antitrust 
behavior. "
1201,11," If there were any ambiguity, we would follow the general rule of contract interpretation which requires courts to construe an 
ambiguity against the drafter. However, there is no evidence as to which party drafted the lease at issue in this case. "
1204,12," We note that a preliminary injunction which prevents a plaintiff from using his property would constitute a special injury under 
Illinois law. Bank of Lyons, 399 N.E.2d at 1288-89. However, the temporary restraining order issued in this case does not 
constitute such an injury. While the state court ultimately concluded that Jewel was not entitled to sublet to United Skates, there 
is no indication that plaintiffs were injured by the TRO which, apparently, merely gave their legal tenant, Jewel, access to and 
control of its leased premises."
1204,13," Even were we to dismiss all the federal claims against the other defendants, we would decline to exercise our discretion 
under § 1367(c) to dismiss the remaining pendent state law claims, but rather, weighing concerns of judicial economy, fairness 
and comity, we would continue to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. This case is well over a year old, and, like the court in 
Timm, we see ""no need to delay the resolution of this matter (and add to the burdens of the Illinois court system) by having the 
parties litigate the . . . state law issues anew in state court,"" id. at 8-9, especially given the fact that the remaining state law 
breach of lease claim involves a claim of violations of federal antitrust law. "
1209,1," Defendants filed an earlier motion for summary judgment with memorandum in support thereof on August 27, 1993 (Doc. Nos. 
20 and 21), and a supplemental memorandum in support of the motion for summary judgment on October 13, 1993 (Doc. No. 
41). Those motions are incorporated by reference herein, as is Plaintiffs' response which was filed on October 15, 1993 (Doc. 
No. 42). "
1210,2," Plaintiffs' memorandum alleges that WOFCO made the threat to cut off Trail's floorplan a day before Englander made his 
second settlement offer on June 19. However, the letter from WOFCO attached as Plaintiffs' App. A(15) is dated June 19. "
1211,3," HN3[
] The Eleventh Circuit treats settlement agreements as contracts and decides questions regarding settlements by 
looking to state law applicable to contracts in general. Blum v. Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, 709 F.2d 1463 
(11th Cir. 1983). Consequently, Plaintiffs' challenge of the instant settlement agreement on grounds of fraudulent 
misrepresentation and duress are governed by Florida law."
1211,4," As explained below, since the floor plan agreement had a provision allowing WOFCO to terminate the floor plan, it is doubtful 
whether Plaintiffs could meet the first three requirements of a claim for fraudulent misrepresentation. "
1215,5, Any issues not addressed in this Order were not deemed necessary to the opinion due to the Court's ruling herein. 
1223,1," The Plaintiff actually sued Utility Fuels, Inc., a sister company of HL&P. Since that time, however, Utility Fuels completely 
merged into HL&P, and HL&P was substituted as a Defendant herein. For the sake of simplicity, this opinion will refer to all 
activities of Utility Fuels as having been those of HL&P."
1223,2, TUE is an electric utility which operates several lignite-fueled generating stations in Texas.
1223,3," HL&P is an electric utility, and Northwestern is a mining company. "
1224,4," Typical of the character of the pleadings bandied about by both sides of this lawsuit, Mike McLaughlin contends that he did not 
learn of the questionable validity of the leases until after he purchased the land. Given the circumstances, this assertion strains 
the credulity of the Court. "
1226,5," The Defendants also complain, in their reply to Plaintiff's response, that TCA cannot show that they exercised monopoly power 
by setting either monopolistic or monopsonistic prices. TCA is not, of course, ever required to make such a showing. See 
American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 811, 90 L. Ed. 1575, 66 S. Ct. 1125 (1946)(""HN6[
] It is not necessary 
that the power thus obtained should be exercised. Its existence is sufficient.""); United States v. American Airlines, Inc., 743 F.2d 
1114, 1118 (5th Cir. 1984)(quoting same), cert. dism'd, 474 U.S. 1001, 106 S. Ct. 420, 88 L. Ed. 2d 370 (1985). "
1227,6," Both parties also attempt to re-litigate here the question of the options' initial validity. The parties' attempt to reveal the 
relevance of this inquiry, however, has been unavailing. "
1228,7," Northwestern further argues that the fact that those claims were not baseless is established by the state court's refusal to 
direct a verdict on them."" Of course, the state court's refusal to direct a verdict is probative of nothing, and this statement could 
not be sincerely made by anyone with even a passing familiarity with the mechanics of trial. "
1229,8," TCA does not claim the benefit of the speculative damages exception described in Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, 
Inc., 401 U.S. 321, 28 L. Ed. 2d 77, 91 S. Ct. 795 (1971). "
1230,9," In theory, the Court could imagine one reason that HL&P would actually agree to pay inflated prices for its own coal: given that 
HL&P is a state-regulated utility holding monopolies in various markets for electricity, the payments to Northwestern would 
appear as legitimate third-party expenses in HL&P's rate applications. Therefore, the regulating agency might set rates for HL&P 
which appear to be reasonable but which would, in fact, allow HL&P to gain monopoly profits through the monopoly prices it 
pays to itself for coal supplies. TCA, however, has neither pled nor argued such a motive. Rather, Plaintiff states in its Amended Complaint that HL&P's motive 
for entering the lignite supply agreements was perfectly legitimate: "
1231,," In order to operate efficiently, and profitably, that is to say to benefit both ratepayers and investors, electric utilities relying 
on fossil fuels as an energy source must have secure fuel supplies and supply sources to insure continuous production 
capacity. The more efficient a production unit (such as Limestone County Nos. 1 and 2) is, the more profitable the power 
company can be because efficient production insures sales of over-capacity to less efficient producers on the power grid. . . 
. The more secure the fossil fuel supply -- the more efficient the generating station. Plaintiff's Amended Complaint P 10. Furthermore, this admission by TCA goes far to negate the theory that the Defendants' 
requirements contract unlawfully restrains trade. The Defendants, however, have not argued this admission as a basis for 
summary judgment."
1231,10," Hence the ""predatory pricing"" exception of Matsushita is inapplicable."
1231,11," The Defendants argue for summary judgment on the grounds that they have not, in fact, refused to deal with TCA. To this 
end, HL&P claims to have accepted TCA's offer of sale, and Northwestern claims to have ""discussed with TCA the possibility of 
contract mining."" TCA's evidence, however, strongly indicates that these statements are not true and that, in fact, the "
1232,," Defendants have only ""discussed"" dealing with TCA on the basis of clearly onerous terms. For example, HL&P has ""agreed"" to 
purchase TCA's lignite at the bargain price offered, but only if TCA meets conditions such as posting a $ 6.75 million bond 
against unspecified possible losses. Such a dichotomy of possible fact findings is a textbook example of a ""genuine issue"" for 
trial."
1232,12," The Defendants cite Thermogenics for the bald proposition that ""[a] disgruntled landlord or lessor lacks standing to bring a 
Section 2 case because a lessor's injuries are not the kind of injuries to competition that the antitrust laws are meant to prevent."" 
This statement calls for two comments. First, the breadth of this proposition is facially preposterous and, of course, unsupported 
by the cited authority. Second, to the extent that the case otherwise supports the Defendants' motion, the Court would note that, 
for the most part, the dissenting opinion to that 6-5 en banc decision demonstrates a much more learned appreciation of the 
current state of antitrust law. "
1234,13," This is only a slight exaggeration; the argument may have had some merit in this Circuit twenty years ago. See Rosemound 
Sand & Gravel Co. v. Lambert Sand & Gravel Co., 469 F.2d 416 (5th Cir. l972)(finding no Sherman Act jurisdiction in dispute 
between local gravel companies where defendant's products were mined and sold only intrastate, despite out-of-state character 
of plaintiff, its potential purchaser, and defendant's suppliers, and defendant's use of Mississippi River and interstate highways). "
1235,14," This critique is not intended as praise by omission for the Plaintiff's advocacy. Against a well-reasoned and factually-
supported motion, TCA's cursory and conclusory responses would have been woefully insufficient. "
1250,1," Given the remittitur, the Court will continue its consideration of Stelwagon's motion for attorney's fees pending final resolution of 
this matter."
1250,2," Notwithstanding the company's name, Stelwagon is not a manufacturer. See Tr. of 12/14/93, at 52 (testimony of John R. 
Keenan). "
1251,3," Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a)(1) provides that: If during a trial by jury a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a 
reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue, the court may determine the issue against that party and may grant a 
motion for judgment as a matter of law against that party with respect to a claim or defense that cannot under the 
controlling law be maintained or defeated without a favorable finding on that issue."
1251,4," Rule 50(b) reads, in relevant part, as follows: Whenever a motion for a judgment as a matter of law made at the close of all the evidence is denied or for any reason is 
not granted, the court is deemed to have submitted the action to the jury subject to a later determination of the legal 
questions raised by the motion. Such a motion may be renewed by service and filing not later than 10 days after entry of 
judgment. . . . Rule 59(a) reads, in relevant part, as follows: A new trial may be granted to all or any of the parties and on all or part of the issues (1) in an action in which there has 
been a trial by jury, for any of the reasons for which new trials have heretofore been granted in actions at law in the courts 
of the United States . . . . "
1252,5," In resolving Stelwagon's breach of contract claim, state law applies. See Erie R.R. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 82 L. Ed. 1188, 
58 S. Ct. 817 (1938). Neither party contests that Pennsylvania law applies."
1252,6," Although plaintiff has agreed that this is the evidentiary standard it must meet, the Court's review of the case law does not 
support this conclusion. Although a number of cases decided by the federal courts sitting in Pennsylvania have adopted this 
characterization of Pennsylvania law, see, e.g., Richardson v. John F. Kennedy Memorial Hosp., 838 F. Supp. 979, 987-88 (E.D. 
Pa. 1993); Kassab v. Ragnar Benson, Inc., 254 F. Supp. 830, 832 (W.D. Pa. 1966), it appears that the case upon which this line 
of precedent is based, Miller v. Wise, 33 Pa. Super. 589, 593 (1907), dealt not with a garden-variety oral contract, but with an 
oral contract that allegedly modified a written agreement. See Pellegrene v. Luther, 403 Pa. 212, 169 A.2d 298, 299 (Pa. 1961) 
(""The law is well settled that a written agreement can be modified by a subsequent oral agreement provided the latter is based 
upon a valid consideration and is proved by evidence which is clear, precise and convincing.""). The clear and precise standard 
has also been applied when fraud is claimed in the formation of a contract, see Krause v. Great Lakes Holdings, Inc., 387 Pa. 
Super. 56, 563 A.2d 1182, 1187 (Pa. Super. 1989), appeal denied, 574 A.2d 70 (Pa. 1990), or when an oral contract creating or 
modifying a will is sought to be enforced, see Kelly v. Sheehan, 378 Pa. 33, 105 A.2d 706, 707 (Pa. 1954); Hatbob v. Brown, 
394 Pa. Super. 234, 575 A.2d 607, 612 (Pa. Super. 1990). Also significant is the omission of this standard in the Pennsylvania 
Suggested Standard Civil Jury Instructions, which highlight that oral contracts are just as enforceable as written ones, see Pa. 
SSJI (Civil) § 15.01, but fail to mention the clear and precise standard. Thus, the heightened standard of clear and precise 
evidence would appear to be applicable to situations where a party seeks to modify a written document with a subsequent oral 
contract, not for generally establishing an oral contract. Since both parties have argued that the clear and precise standard applies, and since plaintiff's proof was sufficient to go to the 
jury based on the higher standard, the Court will apply the clear and precise standard in this case. "
1253,7," At the time of the trial, Mr. Amhaus was employed by GS Roofing Products, Inc., a company that had purchased Tarmac's 
assets while the litigation was pending. See Tr. of 12/15/1993, at 97-98 (testimony of Gordon Amhaus)."
1253,8," In the alternative, Tarmac requests a new trial because Dr. Perry's opinion was improperly admitted and because the verdict 
was against the weight of the evidence. The former issue is taken up infra. As to the weight of the evidence argument, the 
liability verdict in Stelwagon's favor does not constitute ""a miscarriage of justice."" See Klein, 992 F.2d at 1290. The amount of 
damages, however, is suspect, and forms the basis for the Court's remittitur, also discussed infra. "
1254,9," Tarmac argues in the alternative that the failure to show a clear and unequivocal waiver and the Court's incorrect instruction on 
the performance exception demand a new trial. Tarmac also claims that the jury's verdict on the performance issue was against 
the weight of the evidence. The Court finds these arguments to be without merit."
1254,10," Whether there was sufficient evidence to support the damages awarded is a different matter, one taken up below in the 
discussion of the motion for remittitur. "
1255,11," Tarmac's repeated attempts to exclude the testimony of Dr. Perry rest largely on the basis that Dr. Perry's methodology is 
flawed. The Court found Dr. Perry to be qualified, without objection, as an expert in economics and price discrimination analysis. 
See Tr. of 12/16/93, at 51-52. Review of Dr. Perry's methodology indicates application of standard economic principles. Cf. 
Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 125 L. Ed. 2d 469,     U.S.    ,    , 113 S. Ct. 2786, 2795-97 (1993) (discussing the 
application of the Rules of Evidence to proffered scientific expert testimony). Tarmac's complaints are essentially disagreements 
with Dr. Perry's conclusions as well as the thoroughness of his factual basis. The Court finds that there were sufficient facts upon 
which to base the opinion and that any flaws in the process are not so substantial to deprive Dr. Perry of ""'good grounds' for his . 
. . conclusions."" In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., 35 F.3d 717, slip op. at 49 (3d Cir. 1994). Tarmac's objections are more 
properly directed at attacking the weight that should be accorded the opinion, not the opinion's admissibility. See Breidor v. 
Sears, Roebuck & Co., 722 F.2d 1134, 1139-41 (3d Cir. 1983); see also United States v. L.E. Cooke Co., 991 F.2d 336, 342 (6th 
Cir. 1993); Singer Co. v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 579 F.2d 433, 443 (8th Cir. 1978) (holding that ""it is . . . for the jury, "
1256,," with the assistance of vigorous cross-examination, to measure the worth of the opinion""). The objections based on the improper 
admission of Dr. Perry's report are therefore without merit. "
1257,12," $ 74,242 + ($ 450,383.50 x 3) = $ 1,423,392.50."
1257,13," Given the disposition of defendant's post-trial motion, plaintiff's petition for attorney's fees will be denied without prejudice, 
pending the final resolution of this litigation. "
1287,1," Because the bulk of the fact-related issues on appeal concern the district court's analysis of the record on summary judgment, 
we generally present the evidence in a light most favorable to Grumman. See, e.g., Levy v. FDIC, 7 F.3d 1054, 1056 (1st Cir. 
1993). Naturally, where the story touches on matters necessarily decided by the jury, we present the evidence in a manner most 
favorable to DG. See, e.g., Toucet v. Maritime Overseas Corp., 991 F.2d 5, 11 (1st Cir. 1993) (review of jury's damage award). "
1288,2," For the sake of simplicity, we will refer to all three of the 1975 defendants as ""CSSC."""
1288,3," There is some evidence that during the 1970s DG sold or licensed proprietary information to equipment owners under 
agreements which permitted owners to allow third parties to use that information to service the owners' computers."
1288,4," DG and Grumman (which acquired CSSC in 1984) vigorously dispute the precise scope of this authorization. See infra 
Sections II.C.1.a and III.A.3."
1288,5," Another provision of the Settlement Agreement prohibited CSSC from using DG proprietary information in the design or 
manufacture of computer equipment. That provision is not at issue in this case."
1288,6," Grumman acquired CSSC in 1984, thereby becoming a successor in interest to CSSC's rights under the 1976 Settlement 
Agreement. "
1289,7," This latter group is comprised of Cooperative Maintenance Organizations (""CMOs"")."
1289,8," Grumman subsequently filed an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that DG 
had violated California's antitrust laws. See Grumman Sys. Support Corp. v. Data General Corp., 125 F.R.D. 160 (N.D. Cal. 
1988). That court later dismissed Grumman's action on the grounds that the claim was a compulsory counterclaim to DG's 
copyright infringement action pending in the District of Massachusetts. Id."
1289,9," The jury subsequently found that Grumman continued to use ADEX in violation of the injunction. That finding is unchallenged 
on appeal."
1289,10," In the course of the pre- and post-trial litigation, the district court issued a series of published and unpublished opinions which 
contain additional background material. See, e.g., Data General Corp. v. Grumman Sys. Support Corp., 761 F. Supp. 185 (D. 
Mass. 1991) (""Grumman II""); Data General Corp. v. Grumman Sys. Support Corp., No. 88-0033-S (D. Mass. May 2, 1991) 
(""Grumman III""); Data General Corp. v. Grumman Sys. Support Corp., 795 F. Supp. 501 (D. Mass. 1992) (""Grumman IV""); Data 
General Corp. v. Grumman Sys. Support Corp., 834 F. Supp. 477 (D. Mass. 1992) (""Grumman V""); Data General Corp. v. 
Grumman Sys. Support Corp., 825 F. Supp. 340 (D. Mass. 1993) (""Grumman VI""); Data General Corp. v. Grumman Sys. 
Support Corp., 825 F. Supp. 361 (D. Mass. 1993) (""Grumman VII""). "
1290,11," Although the reasoning of the Fourth Circuit's affirmance differed from that of Judge Motz on other issues, the two courts 
appear to have been in total agreement with respect to the Settlement Agreement issue."
1290,12, Grumman presented the antitrust claims as independent counterclaims as well. 
1291,13," The district court also held that neither ADEX nor DG's schematics were ""essential facilities"" that DG (as a monopolist in the 
service aftermarket) must share with its competitors. Id. at 191-92. Grumman does not assign error to this aspect of the district 
court's decision."
1291,14," ""Source code"" refers to an annotated text, written in a programming language intelligible to humans, that represents the set of 
instructions comprising a particular computer program. See Computer Assocs. Int'l, Inc. v. Altai, Inc., 22 F.3d 32, 33 n.1 (2d Cir. 
1994); Johnson Controls, Inc. v. Phoenix Control Sys., Inc., 886 F.2d 1173, 1175 n.2 (9th Cir. 1989). ""Object code"" refers to the 
text of the same set of instructions, translated into binary form (a sequence of zeros and ones) intelligible to the computer itself. 
See id."
1291,15," The errors are described infra, note 23. "
1292,16," HN1[
] ""Nonduplicative profits"" are those profits earned by Grumman that would not have been available to DG in the absence of Grumman's wrongful conduct. See 17 U.S.C. § 504(b) (providing that copyright owner may ""recover . . . any profits of 
the infringer that are attributable to the infringement and are not taken into account in computing the actual damages"")."
1292,17," On the verdict slip, the jury assessed the same amount of damages -- $ 27,417,000 -- for Grumman's misappropriation of 
trade secrets. "
1293,18, Massachusetts law provides for a higher rate of prejudgment interest on compensatory damages than does federal law. 
1294,19," HN8[
] To demonstrate copyright infringement, DG had the burden of demonstrating (1) that it owns a valid copyright in the 
versions of ADEX alleged to have been copied, and (2) that Grumman copied constituent, original elements of ADEX. See Feist 
Publications, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340, 111 S. Ct. 1282, 1296, 113 L. Ed. 2d 358 (1991); Concrete Mach. Co. v. 
Classic Lawn Ornaments, Inc., 843 F.2d 600, 605 (1st Cir. 1988); 3 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 
13.01, at 13-5 to 13-6 (1993) (hereinafter ""Nimmer"")."
1294,20," HN9[
] Where the program contains trade secret material, the copyright regulations permit some portions of the deposit to be blocked out, and allow a portion of the deposit to be in machine-readable ""object code"" (lines of zeroes and ones).  37 C.F.R. § 
202.20(c)(2)(vii)(A)(2). If the deposit includes no blocked-out portions and consists entirely of source code, the first and last ten 
pages of the program will suffice. Id."
1294,21, The district court instructed the jury as follows: 
1295,," Because the function or registration [with respect to computer programs] is symbolic, clerical errors in the materials 
deposited with the application for registration do not affect the validity of the registration. For instance, discrepancies in the 
dates, filing the wrong pages, or partial pages, and similar errors, if accepted by the Copyright Office, do not impeach the 
validity and effect of the registration. If the errors were intentional, however, for purposes of deceiving the Copyright Office 
and perpetrating a fraud, the errors invalidate the registration."
1295,22," Grumman does not question the validity of the copyright registration for the last five versions of ADEX, which Grumman also 
admitted it copied and used. Therefore, Grumman's argument, if persuasive, would not constitute a complete defense to the 
infringement action; the real issue is the extent of infringement properly subject to suit."
1295,23," With respect to ADEX Revisions 0.0, 1.0, and 2.0, DG attempted to deposit the first and last ten pages of source code (with no 
trade secrets blocked-out) in accordance with 37 C.F.R. § 202.20(c)(2)(vii)(A)(2). In all three instances, DG deposited the correct 
last ten pages but did not deposit the correct first ten pages. Nonetheless, in the case of ADEX Revisions 1.0 and 2.0, there was 
only one difference between the deposited pages and the pages DG intended to deposit: the Primary Label Block on the 
copyright deposit designates ""1982"" rather than ""1983"" as the copyright date. The same error occurred in the deposit for ADEX 
Revision 0.0, although there were three additional errors: two other discrepancies concerning the Primary Label Block, and one 
line of code missing from the deposited pages. The district court observed that ""the Primary Label Block, which contains 
descriptive information about the tape, does not instruct or direct the computer."" Grumman VI, 825 F. Supp. at 356. In addition, 
Mr. Gove, DG's expert, testified that the few errors in the deposited pages would have no bearing on the operation of the 
programs."
1295,24," HN11[
] Some courts have suggested that a defendant must show that it was prejudiced by a fraudulent misstatement or 
omission in a registration application, see, e.g., Harris, 734 F.2d at 1335 (""Absent intent to defraud and prejudice, inaccuracies in 
copyright registrations do not bar actions for infringement.""), whereas others merely require proof that an intentional error, if 
discovered by the Copyright Office, would have been material to the registration decision, see, e.g., Eckes, 736 F.2d at 861-62. 
Any substantive difference in these standards has no bearing on our decision today. "
1296,25," Because Section 410(a) does not specify the nature of the ""examination,"" and because there is evidence that Congress 
intended the government to play a role in copyright registration that is much more limited than its extensive responsibilities in 
overseeing patent registration, the Copyright Office may have the discretion to limit its examination to the facial validity of the 
application and deposit. See Midway Mfg. Co. v. Bandai-America, Inc., 546 F. Supp. 125, 143-44 (D.N.J. 1982) (citing, inter alia, 
Donald v. Uarco Business Forms, 478 F.2d 764, 765 n.1 (8th Cir. 1973)). Nevertheless, any such HN15[
] discretion resides in the Copyright Office, not the applicant, for Section 410(a) suggests that an applicant must always give the Copyright Office an 
opportunity to undertake an appropriate examination."
1296,26," Another objective of Section 408(b) might be to give would-be infringers notice of the extent of their civil liability. Yet, this can 
hardly have been an important legislative goal because a copyright owner is free to register any time before filing suit, even after 
the act of infringement. See 17 U.S.C. § 408(a); Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. v. Dunnahoo, 637 F.2d 1338, 1342-43 (9th 
Cir. 1981); see also Olan Mills, Inc. v. Linn Photo Co., 23 F.3d 1345, 1349 (8th Cir. 1994); Konor Enters. v. Eagle Publications, 
Inc., 878 F.2d 138, 140 (4th Cir. 1989). In addition, because Congress had included a recordation requirement elsewhere in the 
copyright laws until 1988, see 17 U.S.C.A. § 205(d) (West 1977) (providing that recordation of transfer of copyright ownership is 
prerequisite to infringement suit by transferee), but did not do so in the context of Section 408, we may infer that affording notice 
to potential infringers was not Congress's primary motivation in drafting Section 408(b). See City of Chicago v. Environmental 
Defense Fund, 128 L. Ed. 2d 302, 114 S. Ct. 1588, 1593 (1994) (""It HN16[
] is generally presumed that Congress acts 
intentionally and purposely when it includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another."") (citation, "
1297,," internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted); United States ex rel S. Prawer & Co. v. Fleet Bank, 24 F.3d 320, 329 (1st Cir. 
1994) (similar)."
1297,27," Contrary to Grumman's vigorous assertions, this court's opinion in Unistrut Corp. v. Power, 280 F.2d 18 (1st Cir. 1960), does 
not compel a different rule. In that case, plaintiff claimed infringement of the 1942 edition of its catalog but apparently sought to 
prove unauthorized copying at trial by demonstrating the similarity of the defendant's work to the 1943 edition of plaintiff's 
catalog, ""which admittedly contained some, unspecified, additions."" Id. at 23. Because ""there was no proof that copies of this 
later edition were deposited with the Copyright Office, and there was no proof that the infringed material was contained in the 
1942 edition,"" we held that there was insufficient proof of infringement of the earlier edition. Id. Unistrut is distinguishable in at 
least two respects. First, our opinion in Unistrut does not suggest that the plaintiff mistakenly deposited the 1943 edition when 
attempting to register a copyright claim concerning the 1942 edition; hence, Unistrut cannot serve as authority on the legal 
ramifications of registration errors. Second, in this case there is evidence that sections of source code from ADEX Revisions 0.0 
to 2.0 were among the pages deposited with the Copyright Office, even if other portions of the deposited material came from 
other computer programs. "
1298,28," In its brief, DG states that ""Data General collected and provided to Grumman copies of the entire source code of all of the sub-
programs that were, or should have been, filed in the Copyright Office for each of the relevant revisions of MV/ADEX."" Grumman 
does not challenge this assertion."
1298,29," If a showing of prejudice is necessary to enable a defendant to use a registration error as a defense to an infringement action, 
see supra note 24, Grumman has failed in this respect as well because Grumman has not shown that it was misled as to the 
copyrightability of ADEX Revisions 0.0 to 2.0. It appears that Grumman has always acted in a manner consistent with the belief 
that each revision of ADEX contains copyrightable elements. In these proceedings, moreover, Grumman has never seriously 
argued that the first three versions of ADEX are entirely devoid of original computer code, and has consistently admitted that it 
made identical copies of the entire contents of each version of ADEX at issue in this action. Accordingly, we are unable to see 
why Grumman was disadvantaged by bearing the burden of proving that there are no copyrightable elements in the first three 
versions of ADEX, a task even Grumman seems to have forsworn."
1298,30," In pertinent part, Section 301(a) provides that ""all HN20[
] legal or equitable rights that are equivalent to any of the exclusive 
rights within the general scope of copyright . . . are governed exclusively by this title. No person is entitled to any such right or 
equivalent right in any such work under the common law or statutes of any State."" "
1299,31," Grumman insists that acquisition of copyrightable software in violation of confidentiality agreements is equivalent to 
unauthorized copying where, as appears to be the case here, the defendant does not actually learn the trade secrets embodied 
in the software. The qualitative difference between unauthorized copying and such acts as the discovery of wrongfully acquired 
trade secrets and the illegal use of that knowledge may be more striking than the difference between unauthorized copying and 
mere participation in the breach of a confidentiality agreement. But we cannot agree that the latter relationship is one of 
equivalence."
1299,32," The relevant contract language appears infra, note 37. "
1300,33," Grumman asserts that any ambiguity must be interpreted against DG as the drafter of the Settlement Agreement. However, 
HN26[
] because the Settlement Agreement is the product of negotiations by sophisticated parties represented by counsel, this 
""'secondary rule of construction . . . perhaps should have but slight force.'"" Acme Markets, Inc. v. Dawson Enters., 253 Md. 76, 
251 A.2d 839, 847 (Md. 1969) (quoting Rossi v. Douglas, 203 Md. 190, 100 A.2d 3, 6 (Md. 1953)). In any event, this interpretive 
presumption has no application where, as here, the record contains extrinsic evidence sufficient to discover the intention of the 
parties to the Settlement Agreement. See Pacific Indem. Co. v. Interstate Fire & Casualty Co., 302 Md. 383, 488 A.2d 486, 497 
(Md. 1985); St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Pryseski, 292 Md. 187, 438 A.2d 282, 288 (Md. 1981)."
1300,34," In its entirety, paragraph four reads as follows:"
1300,4," . Defendants [CSSC, Lloyd Root, and Robert Montgomery] agree, jointly and severally, that they will not, directly or 
indirectly, copy or utilize ""Proprietary Information"" of DGC for the design or manufacture of computers or any other purpose 
except [i] maintenance or repair of DGC equipment, [ii] installation and integration of equipment manufactured or sold by 
companies other than DGC, or [iii] other purposes permitted by any proprietary or confidentiality legends accompanying or 
made part of any data or documentation comprising Proprietary Information. ""Proprietary Information"" of DGC shall mean 
data and documentation which is marked confidential or proprietary to DGC by appropriate legend. "
1301,35," Because neither party has offered a legal definition of a license, we will regard the term as carrying its usual definition: HN27[ ] permission to use the property of another. Black's Law Dictionary 829-30 (5th ed. 1979). A license can be general, with few 
or no restrictions, or quite limited. The use of the word ""license"" in a contract is clearly evidence of an intent to permit use, but 
the absence of the word is not dispositive, as long as other contract language grants some permission to use. Cf. 3 Nimmer § 
10.03[A], at 10-38 (explaining that ""[a] nonexclusive license may be granted orally, or may even be implied from conduct"") 
(footnotes omitted)."
1301,36," DG argues that the Settlement Agreement was not intended to apply to proprietary information created by DG after settlement 
of the 1975 lawsuit. We cannot agree. The language ""'Proprietary Information' of DGC"" strikes us as unambiguous, and 
unqualifiedly embraces all DG proprietary information, whether in existence in 1976 or not. However, even if the phrase were 
ambiguous, an examination of the extrinsic evidence reveals that DG would still not be entitled to summary judgment on this 
basis because there is extrinsic evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to find that the Settlement Agreement was intended 
to apply to information in the future."
1301,37," For example, in one version of DG's On-Call Service Agreement, service customers agreed ""NOT TO DISCLOSE OR MAKE 
AVAILABLE TO ANY THIRD PARTY THE PROPRIETARY ITEMS [installed at customer locations by DG;] AND . . . TO 
RETURN ALL THE PROPRIETARY ITEMS TO [DG] UPON EXPIRATION OR CANCELLATION/TERMINATION OF THIS 
AGREEMENT."""
1301,38," Grumman also acquired copies of ADEX from former DG employees who brought copies of the program with them, in violation 
of their employment agreements. Grumman does not maintain that the Settlement Agreement gives it the right to duplicate and 
use copies of ADEX acquired in this manner. "
1302,39, The district court accepted a transcript of Canfield's testimony in STI as part of the summary judgment record in this case.
1302,40," We note in passing that STI appeared to adopt Canfield's statement in the course of the STI trial. When Judge Motz 
characterized Canfield's testimony as stating that proprietary maintenance tools in the hands of CSSC's customers ""were to be 
used . . . for the customer's own computers,"" counsel for STI responded, ""I don't have a problem with that."" "
1303,41," Our conclusion that the ""maintenance or repair"" exception was intended to be a third-party access agreement also disposes of 
Grumman's assertion that the Settlement Agreement somehow obligates DG to distribute its proprietary maintenance 
information either to Grumman's customers or directly to Grumman. As explained above, the extrinsic evidence demonstrates 
that the Agreement concerns Grumman's right to gain access to proprietary information that DG distributes to equipment 
owners. Nowhere does the Agreement say that DG will distribute to Grumman proprietary information DG chooses to distribute 
only to its own field engineers. Further, it would be unreasonable to interpret the Agreement as providing for direct licensing of 
proprietary information on demand given that the Agreement did not even allow the individual parties to the Agreement (Root 
and Montgomery, both former DG employees) to retain or purchase any proprietary information they acquired during their 
employment with DG. And finally, HN28[
] a mere agreement to agree to an unspecified future license would be unenforceable 
as a matter of contract law. See STI, 737 F. Supp. at 339 (citing First Nat'l Bank v. Burton, Parsons & Co., 57 Md. App. 437, 470 
A.2d 822, 828 (Md. Ct. Spec. App.), cert. denied, 300 Md. 90, 475 A.2d 1201 (Md. 1984)). "
1304,42," Note that the Lasercomb court held that HN30[
] a copyright misuse defense does not require proof of an antitrust violation, 
only proof that ""the copyright is being used in a manner violative of the public policy embodied in the grant of a copyright."" 911 
F.2d at 978."
1304,43," Even if Grumman's antitrust counterclaims could survive summary judgment, Grumman would not necessarily have the 
privilege of interposing its counterclaims as defenses. Lasercomb explains that HN31[
] copyright misuse and its ancestor, 
patent misuse, are equitable defenses. See 911 F.2d at 976-77. If copyright misuse is an equitable defense, a defendant that 
has itself acted inequitably may not be entitled to raise such a defense. Cf. 3 Nimmer § 13.09[B], at 13-278 to 13-279 (noting the 
possible propriety of denying a defense of unclean hands ""when the defendant has been guilty of conduct more unconscionable 
and unworthy than the plaintiff's""). Mere infringement may not be inequitable in this context because a misuse defense would 
appear to sanction at least some infringement as a necessary measure of self-help. But violation of a valid injunction against 
further infringement issued pursuant to a court's equitable powers would constitute blatantly inequitable behavior. Here, the jury 
specifically found that Grumman violated the district court's 1988 injunction against the use of ADEX. Grumman does not appeal 
that finding. Accordingly, while Grumman may be free to pursue antitrust counterclaims, cf.  Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. 
International Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 138-40, 20 L. Ed. 2d 982, 88 S. Ct. 1981 (1968) (holding that doctrine of in pari delicto is 
not a defense to an antitrust suit), it would not necessarily be entitled to raise a defense of copyright misuse predicated on 
antitrust violations. "
1305,44," In its charge, the district court stated: If you conclude that Grumman would not have been in the business of servicing MV computers but for its possession and 
use of MV/ADEX, or that some or all of Grumman's customers would not have hired Grumman to maintain or repair their 
computers if Grumman had not infringed Data General's copyrights, then you should consider what percentage of those 
customers would have done business with Data General instead. You may take into account all the diverse factors which . . . might bear on the determination, including price, customer 
loyalty and level of customer satisfaction."
1305,45," Grumman's other challenges to the jury instructions are either meritless or moot. First, Grumman claims that an apportionment 
instruction (the subject of the following section) would have affected the outcome of the lost profits analysis. As we explained 
above, however, the district court's instructions enabled the jury to make findings about the relative role of infringing and 
noninfringing factors in customers' selection of Grumman over DG. Further examination of the value added by Grumman to its 
own products would have been unnecessary. Second, Grumman contends that it was impermissible for DG to calculate its lost 
profits based on its monopoly prices. This argument is untimely because Grumman did not raise this issue in its objections to the 
jury instructions. In any event, Grumman has not established that DG's exploitation of its monopoly is unlawful, infra, Section "
1306,," III.B.2., and has not provided any authority for the proposition that actual damages cannot be based on the loss of lawful 
monopoly profits. Third, Grumman suggests that the damage award was inflated because the jury was improperly forbidden from 
considering the extent to which the 1976 Settlement Agreement authorized Grumman's use of ADEX. However, as illustrated 
supra, Section III.A.3., Grumman did not present trialworthy evidence that the Settlement Agreement authorized the acquisition 
and use of ADEX in any meaningful sense."
1306,46," Such rebuttal evidence, if it existed, should have been easily within Grumman's reach. For example, the evidence suggests 
that purchasers of DG equipment generally used DG service in the initial warranty period. Thus, owners of DG equipment might 
periodically upgrade a portion of their equipment, and therefore there would be times when one owner will have some newly 
upgraded equipment still under warranty and some older equipment no longer under warranty. Grumman could readily have 
introduced evidence that some of these equipment owners ignored their single-vendor preference by turning to a TPM for 
service of equipment not under warranty. Similarly, it would not have been difficult for Grumman to discredit Friedman's opinion 
by showing that DG had a significant number of price-conscious service customers who regularly turned to other vendors when 
purchasing new equipment, or that customers who purchased DG service on a ""time and materials"" basis often used TPMs as 
well. "
1307,47," In estimating this ""volume loss,"" Friedman assumed that, without ADEX, Grumman would not have been among the TPMs 
competing for MV-related business."
1307,48," Contrary to DG's unsupported assertions, HN39[
] a defendant in a Massachusetts trade secrets action appears to have the 
same right to ask for apportionment along with the same burden of proof. Citing 17 U.S.C. § 504(b) as persuasive authority, the 
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has set forth the following rule for apportionment in trade secrets cases: Once a plaintiff demonstrates that a defendant made a profit from the sale of products produced by improper use of a trade 
secret, the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate those costs properly to be offset against its profit and the portion 
of its profit attributable to factors other than the trade secret. USM Corp. v. Marson Fastener Corp., 392 Mass. 334, 467 N.E.2d 1271, 1276 (Mass. 1984). See also Jet Spray Cooler, Inc. v. 
Crampton, 377 Mass. 159, 385 N.E.2d 1349, 1358-59 n.14 (Mass. 1979) (citing, inter alia, Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures 
Corp., 106 F.2d 45, 48 (2d Cir. 1939), aff'd, 309 U.S. 390, 84 L. Ed. 825, 60 S. Ct. 681 (1940))."
1307,49," This amount included DG's estimated ""volume loss"" and ""excluded revenue."" ""Volume loss"" represents the MV-related 
business that DG would have lost in competition with TPMs even if DG had been the only service vendor with ADEX capability. 
""Excluded revenue"" represents the MV-related business that DG did not have the capacity or the desire to seek, such as service 
contracts for certain systems with at least one non-DG CPU or service contracts for certain non-DG peripheral equipment 
attached to DG CPUs. "
1308,50," Note, however, that HN42[
] if the plaintiff cannot prove actual damages and the defendant shows that none of its gain is attributable to the infringement, the plaintiff would still be entitled to elect statutory damages. See 17 U.S.C. 504(c) (1988); see 
generally 3 Nimmer § 14.04, at 14-47 to 14-79. "
1310,51," Our discussion of equitable and policy considerations is intended to aid courts in apportioning profits when the parties submit 
the issue of infringer's profits to the court, see Sid & Marty Krofft Television Productions, Inc. v. McDonald's Corp., 562 F.2d 
1157, 1175 (9th Cir. 1977) (noting that parties may stipulate to bench trial on issue of infringer's profits), and to provide some 
rational explanation for the discordant aspects of the case law on apportionment. While a court may instruct the jury that 
damages should be ""reasonable"" (as the court in this case did without objection from either party), we do not hold that a court 
may ask the jury itself to weigh matters of equity and public policy."
1310,52," In order to avoid undue confusion and unnecessary proceedings, we add the following procedural notes to assist the district 
court in resolving the issue of apportionment of Grumman's nonduplicative profits. Cognizant of our authority to take whatever action ""may be just under the circumstances,"" 28 U.S.C. § 2106, we believe that 
remittitur would provide the most equitable and efficient means of remedying the error. The factual record was highly developed 
at trial on the issue of Grumman's profits, leaving a trail adequate to allow the district court to approximate the effect of the 
erroneous instruction on the jury's verdict. See 6A James Wm. Moore, et al., Moore's Federal Practice P 59.08[7], at 59-207 (2d 
ed. 1994) (explaining that if ""the HN47[
] effect of [an erroneous instruction] can be reasonably approximated to a definite 
portion of the amount of the verdict, the appellate court may condition its affirmance on the plaintiff remitting that amount of the 
verdict which is apparently traceable to the error below""). Moreover, Grumman requested remittitur as an alternative remedy in 
its Rule 59 motion. We are aware that the jury did not separately award actual damages and infringer's profits. Nevertheless, the verdict is relatively 
close to the amount DG requested and it is extremely unlikely that the jury would not have relied primarily on one or the other of 
the competing expert theories. DG requested $ 28,003,000 in damages, consisting of $ 26,364,000 in lost profits and $ 
1,639,000 in nonduplicative profits. The jury awarded DG a total of $ 27,417,000 in damages -- $ 586,000 less than the 
requested amount. As a result, DG appears to have won infringer's profits of at least $ 1,053,000 ($ 27,417,000 - $ 26,364,000) "
1311,," and at most $ 1,639,000. While we do not mandate this particular analysis, we are confident that the district court, with its 
superior understanding of the voluminous record, will be able to estimate either the relevant figures or, if necessary, the 
""maximum effect"" of the error on the jury's verdict. See id. P 59.09[7], at 59-207 to 59-208 (""Even when the effect of the error 
cannot be allocated to a distinct portion of the verdict, remittitur may still be used if the maximum effect of the error can be 
established.""). If DG were to refuse remittitur in favor of a new jury trial on the issue of apportionment of Grumman's nonduplicative profits, we 
hope that the parties will negotiate in good faith to settle the remanded portion of the case or at least agree to a more 
expeditious procedure. See, e.g., Sid & Marty Krofft, 562 F.2d at 1175 (noting that right to jury trial extends to adjudication of 
claim for infringer's profits but that parties may stipulate to bench trial)."
1311,53," The jury awarded the same amount of compensatory damages for both the federal copyright infringement claim and the state 
trade secrets claim. "
1312,54," Grumman does not argue at this stage that DG violated the ""rule of reason"" and proceeds only on a ""per se"" theory. See 
Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 29-31 (noting that in absence of per se liability, antitrust plaintiff must prove that defendant's 
conduct had an ""actual adverse effect on competition"")."
1312,55," The Fourth Circuit came to a similar conclusion on a nearly identical record when it rejected STI's tying claim: If ""access to"" MV/ADEX and repair services are considered to be the products in question, appellants have clearly failed to 
produce sufficient evidence that the products are in fact separate. On the record before us, demand for mere ""access to"" 
MV/ADEX, in contrast to demand for licenses to use MV/ADEX, is indistinguishable from demand for repair services. 
Appellants have introduced no evidence that there are customers who would purchase MV/ADEX-assisted diagnostic 
services separately from all other repair services for Data General equipment. "
1313,," STI, 963 F.2d at 685 n.9."
1313,56," Again, the Fourth Circuit reached a similar conclusion for similar reasons. See STI, 963 F.2d at 684-85."
1313,57," Frederick Raley, Jr., a DG official, testified at his deposition that ""self-maintaining"" CMO customers would still be able to use 
DG service, except that ""they wouldn't be a contract customer, they would be a time and materials customer."" This portion of 
Raley's deposition was actually placed in the record by Grumman as part of an exhibit to an affidavit supporting Grumman's 
opposition to one of DG's motions for summary judgment. "
1314,58," Likewise, there is no evidence in the record that former TPM customers have reluctantly terminated their relationship with 
Grumman in order to participate in the CMO program. Cf.  Kodak, 112 S. Ct. at 2081 (noting that record contained evidence that 
""consumers have switched to Kodak service even though they preferred [TPM] service"")."
1314,59," DG does not seriously dispute Grumman's contention that the aftermarket for service of DG computers comprises the 
""relevant market"" for purposes of antitrust analysis. Accordingly, and in view of our disposition of this case on other grounds, we 
need not consider this issue."
1314,60," We note, however, that the record does contain evidence of DG's monopoly power in the assumed service aftermarket for DG 
computers. In addition to DG's monopoly share (over 90%) of the service aftermarket, the record contains evidence of barriers to "
1315,," entry (e.g., costs to TPMs of obtaining diagnostics and other service ""tools""), market imperfections (e.g., high information costs 
for computer purchasers and high switching costs for DG equipment owners), and more importantly, supracompetitive service 
prices and price discrimination among DG service customers."
1315,61," Grumman also seeks to portray the alleged positive and negative tying arrangements as exclusionary conduct violative of 
Section 2. We do not consider this argument because of our determination in the previous section that DG's ADEX policies 
cannot properly be described as arrangements conditioning the sale of one product on the purchase or non-purchase of another. "
1317,62," Elsewhere in its brief, DG adds that DG's ""refusal to allow Grumman to use MV/ADEX is . . . the precise conduct that the 
antitrust and copyright laws are designed to encourage."" "
1318,63," HN66[
] It is in any event well settled that concerted and contractual behavior that threatens competition is not immune from 
antitrust inquiry simply because it involves the exercise of copyright privileges. See, e.g., Kodak, 112 S. Ct. at 2089 n.29 (""The 
Court has held many times that power gained through some natural and legal advantage such as a patent, copyright, or 
business acumen can give rise to liability if 'a seller exploits his dominant position in one market to expand his empire into the 
next.'"") (quoting Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 611, 97 L. Ed. 1277, 73 S. Ct. 872 (1953) (tying 
case)); United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 U.S. 131, 143, 92 L. Ed. 1260, 68 S. Ct. 915 (1948) (holding that 
horizontal conspiracy to engage in price-fixing in copyright licenses is illegal per se); id. at 159 (holding that block-booking of 
motion pictures -- ""a refusal to license one or more copyrights unless another copyright is accepted"" -- is an illegal tying 
arrangement); Straus v. American Publishers' Ass'n, 231 U.S. 222, 234, 58 L. Ed. 192, 34 S. Ct. 84 (1913) (""No more than the 
patent statute was the copyright act intended to authorize agreements in unlawful restraint of trade . . . .""); Digidyne Corp. v. 
Data General Corp., 734 F.2d 1336 (9th Cir. 1984) (affirming finding of illegal tie between copyrighted software and computer 
hardware), cert. denied, 473 U.S. 908, 87 L. Ed. 2d 657, 105 S. Ct. 3534 (1985); cf.  Miller Insituform, Inc. v. Insituform of N. 
Am., Inc., 830 F.2d 606, 608-09 & n.4 (6th Cir. 1987) (describing ways in which patent holder may violate the antitrust laws), 
cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1064, 98 L. Ed. 2d 988, 108 S. Ct. 1023 (1988); United States v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 648 F.2d 
642, 646-47 (9th Cir. 1981) (same). "
1320,64," Wary of undermining the Sherman Act, however, HN75[
] we do not hold that an antitrust plaintiff can never rebut this 
presumption, for there may be rare cases in which imposing antitrust liability is unlikely to frustrate the objectives of the 
Copyright Act. "
1322,65," We have considered all of Grumman's other arguments, and find none of sufficient merit to alter our conclusions. "
1328,1," HN1[
] Section 2(a) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13(a), 38 Stat. 730, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act provides: It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly, to 
discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality . . . where the effect of such 
discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, 
destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, 
or with customers of either of them."
1328,2," Count V alleged that Smith's Appliance & Furniture Co. violated 15 U.S.C. § 13(f) by knowingly receiving discriminatory pricing 
from Maytag. Count V was dismissed with prejudice on April 29, 1994, after the Smith and BNA settled."
1328,3," Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15(a), provides that ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by 
reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor . . . and shall recover threefold the damages by him 
sustained. . . ."" "
1329,4," In Associated General Contractors, the Supreme Court emphasized that ""Congress did not intend the antitrust laws to provide 
a remedy in damages for all injuries that might conceivably be traced to an antitrust violation."" Instead, the ""focus of the doctrine 
of 'antitrust standing' is somewhat different from that of standing as a constitutional doctrine. Harm to the antitrust plaintiff is 
sufficient to satisfy the constitutional standing requirement of injury in fact, but the court must make the further determination 
whether the plaintiff is a proper party to bring a private antitrust action."" 459 U.S. at 535 n. 31, 103 S. Ct. at 907 n. 31. HN7[
]"
1329,5," Although the Supreme Court in Brooke Group required a showing of actual injury to competition in the market, the holding of 
the case is currently limited to the context of primary line competitors. It is unclear whether the Seventh Circuit would extend 
Brooke Group's requirement of actual injury to competition to secondary line competitors. See Greater Rockford Energy & 
Technology v. Shell Oil, 998 F.2d 391, 400 n. 11 (7th Cir. 1993). "
1331,6," The Hasbrouck case is distinguishable because the retail gasoline market was very price-sensitive so that a small difference in 
retail prices generated significant swings in customers and sales."
1331,7," Even were this Court to adopt the Ninth Circuit's ""injury to competitors"" test and conclude that the antitrust injury requirement 
has been met by BNA, BNA's evidence is insufficient to create an issue for the jury on the causation issue--whether Smith 
Furniture's participation in the Super Value Program had a substantial effect on BNA's ability to capture a sizeable market. BNA 
offers no evidence refuting other relevant factors such as two recessions in the Louisville market, additional competition from 
Sears Brand Central and Circuit City, changes in the distribution procedures in the appliance industry, and increases by 
Whirlpool and G.E. in their market shares. See Bane depo. at 22-25, 105-106, 149-150. "
1332,8," Nor would BNA state a claim under common-law fraud. HN15[
] In order to prove a claim of fraud, Plaintiffs must show: 1) a 
material representation of past or existing facts; 2) which is false; 3) which was made with knowledge or reckless ignorance of its 
falsity; 4) which causes reliance to the detriment of the person relying on the representation. See Knauf Fiber Glass, GmbH v. 
Stein, 615 N.E.2d 115, 123 (Ind. App. 5 Dist. 1993). At a minimum, BNA has failed to show that it relied to its detriment on any 
alleged misrepresentation made by Maytag. "

concluded that Travel Masters did not affect our original opinion's validity. "
1340,4," Since the trial court decided this case, the legislature has amended the Texas Business and Commerce Code regarding 
reformation of covenants not to compete. See TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. §§ 15.50-.51 (Vernon Supp. 1994). However, as 
the trial court finally adjudicated the enforceability of the covenants before the effective date of the amendments, the 
amendments do not apply. TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 15.52 (Vernon Supp. 1994). "

1351,4," Having found a substantial likelihood that plaintiffs will prevail on the monopolization claim, the court will not address the merits 
of the other antitrust claims or the Commerce Clause claims. "
1357,1," O.K. Sand is an Indiana corporation with its principal place of business in Indiana. Martin Marietta is a Delaware corporation 
with its principal place of business in Maryland. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332."
1357,2," The facts of the case are thoroughly discussed in the district court's published opinion, O.K. Sand & Gravel, Inc. v. Martin 
Marietta Corp., 819 F. Supp. 771 (S.D. Ind. 1992). We assume familiarity with these facts, and only summarize them here as 
necessary. "
1358,3," The jury was instructed that the elements of the breach of agency duty claim were the existence of a particular duty; breach; 
damages; and proximate causation. Instr. 22. The jury was instructed that the elements of the constructive fraud were a duty 
between the parties by virtue of the relationship of the parties; silence or representations that were deceptive and violative of that 
duty; justifiable reliance; and damages. Instr. 27. "
1360,4," The argument that O.K. Sand claims embodied its objection to application of a two-year statute of limitations to breach of duty 
went as follows: In other words, my argument, if you will, your Honor, is that breach of fiduciary duty is a lesser, if you will, lesser included 
offense, and that breach of duty included actions that would not constitute constructive fraud, and constructive fraud must 
show the additional action taken for the benefit of the principal. And so that would be the difference, and therefore would--
That's the reason we would argue that there be two separate counts. It goes--The reason that it has a meaning to us, and 
the consequences of it is that we would also be asking the court to reconsider its instruction on commissions. The court 
has--I think correctly--has included commissions, our entitlement to ask the jury to find commissions, return of commissions 
for that breach of fiduciary duty. Case law also--I will be happy the give the court case law and Storey on Equity and three other treatises that establish that 
fraud as well, and breach of duty is again a lesser included, that even more serious constructive fraud gives rise to a cause 
of action for the damages, if you will, to return commissions as well, so we would be seeking return of the commissions on 
the fraud count as well. You say the damages, we would be seeking the same damage in both places under two separate theories. We understand 
that we can't recover the damages twice; we must elect a remedy after the jury comes back, That's the basis for both 
causes of action. Tr. at VIII-9. "
1361,5," The remainder of the instruction concerned O.K. Sand's equitable argument that the statute of limitations did not apply because 
Martin Marietta had fraudulently concealed the facts giving rise to a cause of action."
1361,6," O.K. Sand also claimed that the district court erred when it entered a directed verdict against O.K. Sand on its claim for punitive 
damages. O.K. Sand admits that the issue would only be relevant if we reversed the jury's findings of liability. Since we affirm the 
district court with respect to liability, we do not need to consider this question of damages. "
1362,7," The district court held that Martin Marietta lacked standing to bring this claim, although we affirm on the ground that Martin 
Marietta has failed to allege an antitrust injury. For discussion of the relationship between antitrust standing and antitrust injury, 
see Greater Rockford Energy and Technology v. Shell Oil, 998 F.2d 391, 394-96 & n.7 (7th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 127 L. Ed. "
1363,2," d 375, 114 S. Ct. 1054 (1994); Local Beauty Supply, Inc. v. Lamaur, Inc., 787 F.2d 1197, 1201 (7th Cir. 1986); P. Areeda and 
H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law (1993 Supp.) P 334.3. "
1370,1," The NFL argues in passing that certain expert testimony related to the relevant market issue was inherently unreasonable and 
thus could not support the jury's relevant market finding. We do not consider this passing argument to be sufficient to raise the 
relevant market issue on appeal as HN4[
] matters averted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at 
developed argumentation, are deemed waived on appeal.  United States v. Innamorati, 996 F.2d 456, 468 (1st Cir. 1993). More 
importantly, the NFL did not challenge the relevant market issue in either its directed verdict motion or in its motion for judgment 
as a matter of law. We will not consider arguments which could have been, but were not, advanced below.  Domegan v. Fair, 
859 F.2d 1059, 1065 (1st Cir. 1988). "
1372,2," This same argument distinguishes cases cited by the NFL for the proposition that a franchisor's disapproval of a proposed sale 
of a franchise does not give rise to an antitrust injury. See Kestenbaum v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 514 F.2d 690 (5th Cir. 1975), 
cert. denied, 424 U.S. 943, 47 L. Ed. 2d 349, 96 S. Ct. 1412 (1976); McDaniel v. General Motors Corp., 480 F. Supp. 666 
(E.D.N.Y. 1979). Individual decisions to block the sale of a franchise do not implicate the harm to competition that is caused by a 
policy restricting all sales of a certain type of ownership interest. Only the broad-based policy has the potential to compromise 
the entire competitive process for the buying and selling of a good in a relevant market. "
1374,3," The NFL maintains that price and output are not affected because its ownership policy does not limit the number of games or 
teams, does not raise ticket prices or the prices of game telecasts and does not affect the normal consumer of the NFL's product 
in any other way. Such facts might be relevant to an inquiry of whether the NFL's policy harms overall efficiency, see infra note 
[4], but it is not relevant to whether the policy affects output and prices in the relevant market for ownership interests. Just 
because consumers of ""NFL football"" are not affected by output controls and price increases does not mean that consumers of a 
product in the relevant market are not so affected. In this case, two types of consumers are denied products by the NFL policy: 
consumers who want to buy stock of the Patriots or other teams, and consumers like Sullivan who want to ""purchase"" 
investment capital in the market for public financing."
1374,4," Although the product at issue in the relevant market is ""ownership interests,"" efficiency in production of that product can be 
measured by the value of the ownership interest. That is, an improved product produced more efficiently will be reflected in the 
value of the output in question (regardless of the price). In this case, the value of the product depends on the success of the 
Patriots' football team, the overall efficiency of its operations, and the success of the NFL in general. "
1378,5," The language of the contract actually states ""all other assets of Selling Group,"" which includes Sullivan himself. However, 
neither party asserts that Sullivan intended to transfer all his personal assets with this clause and, anyway, the ""all other assets"" 
clause is number seventeen on a list of items referred to by the contract as ""the following assets of the Club and Holdco [the 
Patriots' holding company]."" "
1379,6," The court's failure to instruct on the complete involvement defense was prejudicial error and, by itself, sufficient grounds for 
reversal and a new trial. We do not decide whether any of the other errors, standing alone, are prejudicial. We do hold, however, 
that all the errors taken together are prejudicial."
1379,7," The Supreme Court in Bateman added an additional requirement to the ""equal involvement"" defense: that ""preclusion of suit 
would not significantly interfere with the effective enforcement of"" the antitrust laws. Bateman, 472 U.S. at 311. We do not see a 
preclusion of Sullivan's damages action as presenting any significant interference with antitrust law enforcement. The NFL's 
policy is still subject to challenge under the antitrust laws. Because the equal involvement defense only precludes a damages "
1380,," action, Sullivan could have requested injunctive relief when the public ownership policy was allegedly preventing him from selling 
49% of his team. In addition, other owners who were not involved in the adoption or support of the policy may still bring suit 
should they desire to sell ownership interests in their team to the public."
1380,8," To the extent this conflicts with the ""but for"" standard applied in THI-Hawaii, 627 F.2d at 995 (finding that ""a plaintiff's recovery 
is not barred unless the illegal conspiracy would not have been formed but for its participation""), we decline to follow that portion 
of the case. There is no evidence of such a rigid ""but for"" requirement in the Supreme Court's formulation of the equal 
involvement defense in Bateman, 472 U.S. at 310-11 (finding the defense applies where ""as a direct result of his own actions, 
the plaintiff bears at least substantially equal responsibility for the violations he seeks to redress""). "
1383,9," The Supreme Court did not expressly consider the issue presented here. Therefore, it is impossible to tell whether the Court 
was consciously applying the rule of reason to include a broad area of procompetitive benefits in a variety of markets, or whether 
the Court was simply not being very careful and inadvertently extended the rule of reason past its proper scope. There is 
certainly no language, as Sullivan suggests, indicating that the Court was considering the alleged benefit of ""competitive 
balance"" only to the extent that it had procompetitive effects in the market for televised football games. "
1386,1," This is the corporate name listed in the caption of the Complaint. As the text reflects, the actual name is AIPP, Inc. "
1389,2," Unfortunately both sides' presentations on the current motions have been extraordinarily shallow, in terms of both the analysis 
and the authorities cited. Although defendants do prevail, that result cannot really be credited to what their counsel has 
presented as grist for this Court's mill--virtually all of the controlling authorities cited in this opinion were not mentioned in 
defendants' memoranda at all (or were advanced in an inaccurate way). And on D'Last's RICO claim, the analysis owes nothing 
to either side's submissions."
1389,3," This is a confusing characterization in light of what D'Last has alleged as to the parties. Ugent is not identified in the Complaint 
as carrying out any activities in his own name--on the contrary, Count VI seeks to impose personal liability on him on the theory 
that the several defendant corporations are sham entities (the veil-piercing concept). Thus the Complaint's reference to Ugent's 
""employees"" appears to manifest the imprecision of thought or analysis that marks a material part of that pleading. "
1390,4," Further citations to RICO will take the form ""Section--,"" referring to Title 18's numbering."
1390,5, It seems that as of the time of the parties' briefing Ugent had not yet been served with process.
1390,6," Many of the problems with the RICO claim stem from the disorganized, somewhat jumbled and cursory nature of the predicate 
act allegations."
1390,7," American International and Pan American are thus omitted from the ""Ugent Enterprises"" grouping."
1390,8," For example, Complaint P28 also speaks of each defendant (including American International and Pan American) as an 
""enterprise"" as well as a ""person"" defined in Section 1961(4). Then P. Mem. 2 (blithely ignoring how counsel has drafted the 
Complaint) says that the ""enterprise"" is an association (identified as Ugent Enterprises) consisting of all seven corporate 
defendants and Ugent. For now, to view the Complaint in the light most favorable to D'Last, this opinion will assume that the 
alleged RICO enterprise is an association of virtually all, if not all, of the defendants. "
1392,9," It is no accident that D'Last's Count II incorporates the selfsame substantive allegations, and no more, as the predicate for 
charging a conspiracy in violation of the antitrust laws. To be sure, HN5[
] the illegality of purpose of a combination--a 
conspiracy--does not as such disqualify the combination for association-in-fact status under RICO. But where that illegality 
indeed consists of carrying on a pattern of racketeering activity, such disqualification follows under the teaching of Neapolitan 
and the other cases cited here--for there was no independent ""structure,"" no ""enterprise . . . distinct, separate, and apart from a 
pattern of racketeering activity"" ( Jennings, 910 F.2d at 1440)."
1392,10," There are other critical flaws in D'Last's antitrust count. For one thing, it fails to allege injury to competition rather than merely 
to competitors (see, e.g., Car Carriers v. Ford Motor Corp., 745 F.2d 1101, 1107 (7th Cir. 1984); Vakharia v. Swedish 
Covenant Hosp., 824 F. Supp. 769, 779 (N.D. Ill. 1993)). For another, D'Last includes no adequate allegations of a specific 
intent to monopolize--an essential element of Section 2 conspiracies ( Seagood Trading Corp. v. Jerrico, Inc., 924 F.2d 1555, 
1576 (11th Cir. 1991); Appraisers Coalition v. Appraisal Inst., 845 F. Supp. 592, 603 (N.D. Ill. 1994)). "
1393,11," Fishman v. Wirtz, 807 F.2d 520, 542 n.l9 (7th Cir. 1986) declined to extend the Copperweld rationale to a situation having 
""some overlap"" of ownership and control, finding such an extension not warranted under the facts of that case. By contrast, this 
case involves a total overlap--a total unity of interest--among defendants, the same relationship that has led courts in other 
Circuits to apply the Copperweld rationale to find that no antitrust conspiracy may exist in those terms."
1393,12," This Court has examined all of those counts in detail and has found each of them wanting in different ways. But because 
anything said in those respects would be not only dictum but also in the nature of an advisory opinion prohibited by Article III, 
once again silence is the proper course to pursue. "
1394,13," Nor has D'Last's counsel suggested any prospect of a jurisdictionally curative amendment in its memorandum in opposition to 
defendants' motions. "
1406,1," HN8[
] California Public Utilities Code § 739.6 provides: The [CPUC] shall establish rates using cost allocation principles that fairly and reasonably assign to different customer 
classes the costs of providing service to those customer classes, consistent with the policies of affordability and 
conservation. "
1408,2," HN12[
] Section 1757 provides: The review shall not be extended further than to determine whether the commission has regularly pursued its authority, 
including a determination of whether the order or decision under review violates any right of the petitioner under the 
Constitution of the United States or of this State. "
1416,1," While defendant states in its motion to transfer venue that the notice of removal was filed in this court on April 14, 1994, the file 
stamp on the notice is dated April 15, 1994. "
1418,2, The court takes judicial notice of the fact that defendant is located within the Central District of California.
