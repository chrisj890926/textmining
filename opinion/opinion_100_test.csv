Opinion
 [*119]   [***101]   [**1158]  JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court. 
 LEdHN[1A][
] [1A]The Interstate Commerce Commission has the authority to approve rail carrier consolidations 
under certain conditions.  49 U. S. C. § 11301 et  seq. A carrier in an approved consolidation ""is exempt from the 
antitrust laws and from all other law, including State and municipal law, as necessary to let [it] carry out the 
transaction. . . ."" § 11341(a).  These cases require us to decide whether the carrier's exemption under § 11341(a) 
""from all other law"" extends to its legal obligations under a collective-bargaining agreement.  We hold that it does. 
I 
A 
""Prior to 1920, competition was the desideratum of our railroad economy."" St. J oe Paper Co. v. Atlantic Coast Line 
R. Co., 347 U.S. 298, 315 (1954). Following a period of Government ownership during World War I, however, 
""many of the railroads were in very weak condition and their [****6]  continued survival was in jeopardy."" Id., at 315. 
At that time, the Nation made a commitment to railroad carrier consolidation as a means of promoting the health 
and efficiency of the railroad industry.  Beginning with the Transportation Act of 1920, ch. 91, 41 Stat. 456, 
+ Richard T. Conway, Ralph J. Moore, Jr., D. Eugenia Langan, and David P. Lee filed a brief for the National Railway Labor 
Conference as amicus curiae urging reversal.
499 U.S. 117, *117; 111 S. Ct. 1156, **1156; 113 L. Ed. 2d 95, ***95; 1991 U.S. LEXIS 1709, ****2

 
""consolidation of the railroads of the country, in the interest of economy and efficiency, became an established 
national policy . . . so intimately related to the maintenance of an adequate and efficient rail transportation system 
that the 'public interest' in the one cannot be dissociated from that in the other."" United States v. Lowden, 308 U.S. 
225, 232 (1939). See generally St.  [**1159]  Joe Paper Co. v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., supra, at 315-321. 
HN1[
] Chapter 113 of the Interstate Commerce Act, recodified in 1978 at 49 U. S. C. § 11301 et seq., contains 
the current statement of this national policy.  The Act grants the Interstate Commerce Commission exclusive 
authority to examine, condition, and approve proposed mergers [****7]  and consolidations of  [*120]  transportation 
carriers within its jurisdiction.  § 11343(a)(1).  The Act requires the Commission to ""approve and authorize"" the 
transactions when they are ""consistent with the public interest."" § 11344(c).  Among the factors the Commission 
must consider in making its public interest determination are ""the interests of carrier employees affected by the 
proposed transaction."" § 11344(b)(1)(D). 1 In authorizing a merger or consolidation, the Commission  [***102]  ""may 
impose conditions governing the transaction."" § 11344(c).  Once the Commission approves a transaction, a carrier 
is ""exempt from the antitrust laws and from all other law, including State and municipal law, as necessary to let [it] 
carry out the transaction."" § 11341(a). 
 [****8]  HN3[
] When a proposed merger involves rail carriers, the Act requires the Commission to impose labor-
protective conditions on the transaction to safeguard the interests of adversely affected railroad employees.  § 
11347.  In New York Dock Railway -- Control -- Brooklyn Eastern Dist. Terminal, 360 I. C. C. 60, 84-90, aff'd sub 
nom.  New York Dock Railway v. United States, 609 F.2d 83 (CA2 1979), the Commission announced a 
comprehensive set of conditions and procedures designed to meet its obligations under § 11347.  Section 2 of the 
New York Dock conditions HN4[
] provides that the ""rates of pay, rules, working conditions and all collective 
 [*121]  bargaining and other rights, privileges and benefits . . . under applicable laws and/or existing collective 
bargaining agreements . . . shall be preserved unless changed by future collective bargaining agreements."" 360 I. 
C. C., at 84. Section 4 sets forth negotiation and arbitration procedures for resolution [****9]  of labor disputes 
arising from an approved railroad merger. Id., at 85. Under § 4, a merged or consolidated railroad which plans an 
operational change that may cause dismissal or displacement of any employee must provide the employee and his 
union 90 days' written notice.  Ibid. If the carrier and union cannot agree on terms and conditions within 30 days, 
each party may submit the dispute for an expedited ""final, binding and conclusive"" determination by a neutral 
arbitrator.  Ibid. Finally, the New York Dock conditions provide affected employees with up to six years of income 
protection, as well as reimbursements for moving costs and losses from the sale of a home.  See id., at 86-89 (§§ 
5-9, 12). 
B 
The two cases before us today involve separate ICC orders exempting parties to approved railway mergers from 
the provisions of collective-bargaining agreements. 
1.  In No. 89-1027, the Commission approved an application by NWS Enterprises, Inc., to acquire control of two 
previously separate rail carriers, petitioners Norfolk and Western Railway Company (N&W) and Southern Railway 
1 Section § 11344(b)(1) provides:

] In a proceeding under this section which involves the merger or control of at least two class I railroads, as defined by 
the Commission, the Commission shall consider at least the following: 
""(A) the effect of the proposed transaction on the adequacy of transportation to the public. 
""(B) the effect on the public interest of including, or failing to include, other rail carriers in the area involved in the proposed 
transaction. 
""(C) the total fixed charges that result from the proposed transaction. 
""(D) the interest of carrier employees affected by the proposed transaction. 
""(E) whether the proposed transaction would have an adverse effect on competition among rail carriers in the affected region.""

Company (Southern).  See Norfolk Southern Corp. -- Control -- Norfolk & W. R. Co. and Southern R. Co., 366 I. C. 
C. 173  [**1160]  (1982). [****10]  In its order approving control, the Commission imposed the standard New York 
Dock labor-protective conditions and noted the possibility that ""further displacement [of employees] may arise as 
additional coordinations occur."" 366 I. C. C., at 230-231. 
In September 1986, this possibility became a reality.  The carriers notified the American Train Dispatchers' 
Association, the bargaining representative for certain N&W employees,  [*122]  that they proposed to consolidate all 
""power distribution"" -- the assignment of locomotives to particular trains and facilities -- for the N&W-Southern 
operation.  To effect the efficiency move, the carriers informed the union that they would transfer work performed at 
the N&W power distribution center in Roanoke, Virginia, to the Southern  [***103]  center in Atlanta, Georgia.  The 
carriers proposed an implementing agreement in which affected N&W employees would be made management 
supervisors in Atlanta, and would receive increases in wages and benefits in addition to the relocation expenses 
and wage protections guaranteed by the New York Dock conditions.  The union contended that this proposal 
involved a change in the existing [****11]  collective-bargaining agreement that was subject to mandatory 
bargaining under the Railway Labor Act (RLA), 44 Stat. 577, as amended, 45 U. S. C. § 151 et seq. The union also 
maintained that the carriers were required to preserve the affected employees' collective-bargaining rights, as well 
as their right to union representation under the RLA. 
Pursuant to § 4 of the New York Dock procedures, the parties negotiated concerning the terms of the implementing 
agreement, but they failed to resolve their differences.  As a result, the carriers invoked the New York Dock 
arbitration procedures.  After a hearing, the arbitration committee ruled in the carriers' favor.  The committee noted 
that the transfer of work to Atlanta was an incident of the control transaction approved by the ICC, and that it formed 
part of the ""additional coordinations"" the ICC predicted would be necessary to achieve ""greater efficiencies."" The 
committee also held it had the authority to abrogate the provisions of the collective-bargaining agreement and of the 
RLA as necessary to implement the merger. Finally, it held that because the application of the N&W bargaining 
agreement [****12]  would impede the transfer, the transferred employees did not retain their collective-bargaining 
rights. 
 [*123]  The union appealed to the Commission, which affirmed by a divided vote.  It explained that ""HN5[
] it has 
long been the Commission's view that private collective bargaining agreements and [Railway Labor Act] provisions 
must give way to the Commission-mandated procedures of section 4 [of the New York Dock conditions] when 
parties are unable to agree on changes in working conditions required to implement a transaction authorized by the 
Commission."" App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 89-1027, p. 33a.  Accordingly, the Commission upheld the arbitration 
committee's determination that the ""compulsory, binding arbitration required by Article I, section 4 of New York 
Dock, took precedence over RLA procedures whether asserted independently or based on existing collective 
bargaining agreements."" Id., at 35a.  The Commission also held that because the work transfer was incident to the 
approved merger, it was ""immunized from conflicting laws by section 11341(a)."" Ibid. Noting that [****13]  
""imposition of the collective bargaining agreement would jeopardize the transaction because the work rules it 
mandates are inconsistent with the carriers' underlying purpose of integrating the power distribution function,"" the 
Commission upheld the decision to override the collective-bargaining agreement and RLA provisions.  Id., at 37a. 
2.  In No. 89-1028, the Commission approved an application by CSX Corporation to acquire control of the Chessie 
System, Inc., and Seaboard Coastline Industries, Inc.  CSX Corp.-- Control -- Chessie System, Inc., and Seaboard 
Coastline Industries, Inc., [***104]  363  [**1161]  I. C. C. 521 (1980). Chessie was the parent of the Chesapeake 
and Ohio Railway Company and the Baltimore and Ohio Railway Company; Seaboard was the parent of the 
Seaboard Coast Line Railroad Company.  In approving the control acquisition, the Commission imposed the New 
York Dock conditions and recognized that ""additional coordinations may occur that could lead to further employee 
displacements."" 363 I. C. C., at 589. 
 [*124]  In August 1986, the consolidated carrier notified respondent Brotherhood of Railway Carmen that it 
planned [****14]  to close Seaboard's heavy freight car repair shop at Waycross, Georgia, and transfer the 
Waycross employees to Chessie's similar shop in Raceland, Kentucky.  The carrier informed the Brotherhood that 
the proposed transfer would result in a net decrease of jobs at the two shops.  Pursuant to New York Dock, the 
carrier and the union negotiated concerning the terms of an agreement to implement the transfer.  The sticking 
499 U.S. 117, *121; 111 S. Ct. 1156, **1159; 113 L. Ed. 2d 95, ***102; 1991 U.S. LEXIS 1709, ****9

 
point in the negotiations involved a 1966 collective-bargaining agreement between the union and Seaboard known 
as the ""Orange Book."" The Orange Book provided that the carrier would employ each covered employee and 
maintain each employee's work conditions and benefits for the remainder of the employee's working life.  The 
Brotherhood contended that the Orange Book prevented CSX from moving work or covered employees from 
Waycross to Raceland. 
When negotiations broke down, both the union and the carrier invoked the arbitration procedures under § 4 of New 
York Dock.  The arbitration committee ruled for the carrier. It agreed with the union that the Orange Book prohibited 
the proposed transfer of work and employees.  It determined, however, that it could override [****15]  any Orange 
Book or RLA provision that impeded an operational change authorized or required by the ICC's decision approving 
the original merger. The committee then held that the carrier could transfer the heavy repair work, which it found 
necessary to the original control acquisition, but could not transfer employees protected by the Orange Book, which 
it found would only slightly impair the original control acquisition.  Both parties appealed the award to the 
Commission. 
A divided Commission affirmed in part and reversed in part.  The Commission agreed the committee possessed 
authority to override collective-bargaining rights and RLA rights that prevent implementation of a proposed 
transaction.   [*125]  It reasoned, however, that ""imposition of an Orange Book employee exception would 
effectively prevent implementation of the proposed transaction."" CSX Corp. -- Control -- Chessie System, Inc. and 
Seaboard Coast Line Industries, Inc., 4 I. C. C. 2d 641, 650 (1988). The Commission thus affirmed the arbitration 
committee's order permitting the transfer of work but reversed the holding that the carriers could not transfer 
Orange Book employees. 
3.  The unions appealed [****16]  both cases to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
Circuit.  The Court of Appeals considered the cases together and reversed and remanded to the Commission.  
Brotherhood of Railway Carmen v. ICC, 279 U.S. App. D. C. 239, 880 F. 2d 562 (1989). The court held that § 
11341(a) does not authorize the Commission to relieve a party of collective-bargaining  [***105]  agreement 
obligations that impede implementation of an approved transaction.  The court stated various grounds for its 
conclusion.  First, because the court did not read the phrase ""all other law"" in § 11341(a) to include ""all legal 
obstacles,"" it found ""no support in the language of the statute"" to apply the statute to obligations imposed by 
collective-bargaining agreements.  Id., at 244, 880 F. 2d, at 567. Second, the court analyzed the Transportation Act 
of 1920, ch. 91, § 407, 41 Stat. 482, which contained a predecessor to § 11341(a), and found that Congress ""did 
not intend, when it enacted the immunity provision, to override contracts."" 279 U.S. App. D. C., at 247, 880 F. 2d, at 
570. The court noted that Congress had ""focused nearly exclusively [****17]  . . . on specific  [**1162]  types of laws 
it intended to eliminate -- all of which were positive enactments, not common law rules of liability, as on a contract."" 
Ibid. The court further noted that Congress had often revisited the immunity provision without making it clear that it 
included contracts or collective-bargaining agreements.  Ibid. Finally, the court did not defer to the ICC's 
interpretation of the Act, presumably because it determined that the Commission's interpretation was belied by the 
contrary ""'unambiguously  [*126]  expressed intent of Congress,'"" id., at 244, 880 F. 2d, at 567 (quoting Chevron U. 
S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984)). 
In ruling that § 11341(a) did not apply to collective-bargaining agreements, the court ""declined to address the 
question"" whether the section could operate to override provisions of the RLA.  Brotherhood of Railway Carmen, 
supra, at 247-250, 880 F. 2d, at 570-573. It also declined to consider whether the labor-protective conditions 
required by § 11347 are exclusive, or whether § 4 of the New York Dock conditions [****18]  gives an arbitration 
committee the right to override provisions of a collective-bargaining agreement.  279 U.S. App. D. C., at 250, 880 F. 
2d, at 573. The court remanded the case to the Commission for a determination on these issues. 
After the Court of Appeals denied the carriers' petitions for rehearing, the carriers in the consolidated cases filed 
petitions for certiorari, which we granted on March 26, 1990.  494 U.S. 1055 (1990). 2 We now reverse. 
2 On September 9, 1989, the Commission also filed a petition for rehearing, and requested the court to refrain from ruling on the 
petition until the Commission could issue a comprehensive decision on remand addressing issues that the Court of Appeals left 
499 U.S. 117, *124; 111 S. Ct. 1156, **1161; 113 L. Ed. 2d 95, ***104; 1991 U.S. LEXIS 1709, ****14

 
 [****19]  
 [*127]   [***106]   LEdHN[1B][
] [1B]II 
Title 49 U. S. C. § 11341(a) provides: 
"". . . HN6[
] A carrier, corporation, or person participating in that approved or exempted transaction is exempt 
from the antitrust laws and from all other law, including State and municipal law, as necessary to let that person 
carry out the transaction, hold, maintain, and operate property, and exercise control or franchises acquired 
through the transaction. . . .""
We address the narrow question whether the exemption in § 11341(a) from ""all other law"" includes a carrier's legal 
obligations under a collective-bargaining agreement. 
 LEdHN[1C][
] [1C] LEdHN[2A][
] [2A]By its terms, the exemption applies only when necessary to carry out an 
approved transaction.  These predicates, however, are not at issue here, for the Court of Appeals  [**1163]  did not 
pass on them and the parties [****20]  do not challenge them.  HN7[
] For purposes of this decision, we assume, 
without deciding, that the Commission properly considered the public interest factors of § 11344(b)(1) in approving 
the original transaction, that its decision to override the carrier's obligations is consistent with the labor-protective 
requirements of § 11347, and that the override was necessary to the implementation of the transaction within the 
meaning of § 11341(a).  Under these  [*128]  assumptions, we hold that the exemption from ""all other law"" in § 
11341(a) includes the obligations imposed by the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement. 3 
open for resolution.  On September 29, 1989, the Court of Appeals issued an order stating that the Commission's petition for 
rehearing would be ""deferred pending release of the ICC's decision on remand."" App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 89-1027, p. 54a. 
On January 4, 1990, the Commission reopened proceedings in the case remanded to it.  On May 21, 1990, two months after we 
granted the carriers' petitions for certiorari, the Commission issued its remand decision.  CSX Corp. -- Control -- Chessie 
System, Inc. and Seaboard Coast Line Industries, Inc., 6 I. C. C. 2d 715 (1990). In its decision, the Commission adhered to the 
Court of Appeals' ruling that § 11341(a) did not authorize it to override provisions of a collective-bargaining agreement.  The 
Commission held, however, that § 11341(a) authorized it to foreclose resort to RLA remedies for modification and enforcement 
of collective-bargaining agreements ""at least to the extent of [its] authority"" to impose labor-protective conditions under § 11347.  
Id., at 754. The Commission explained that the § 11347 limit on its § 11341(a) authority ""reflects the consistency of the overall 
statutory scheme for dealing with CBA modifications required to implement Commission-approved mergers and consolidations."" 
Id., at 722. The Commission remanded its decision to the parties for further negotiation or arbitration. 
On December 4, 1990, the union respondents petitioned the Court of Appeals for review of the Commission's remand decision.  
The petition raises three issues: (1) whether § 11341(a) authorizes the ICC to foreclose employee resort to the RLA; (2) whether 
§ 11347 authorizes the ICC to compel employees to arbitrate changes in collective-bargaining agreements; and (3) whether 
abrogation of employee contract rights effected a taking in violation of the Due Process and Just Compensation clauses of the 
Fifth Amendment.
3  LEdHN[2B][
] [2B]
On May 23, 1990, and again on September 19, 1990, the union respondents filed motions to dismiss the case as moot.  They 
argued that in light of the alternative ground for decision offered by the ICC on remand from the Court of Appeals, see n. 2, 
supra, the meaning and scope of § 11341(a) was no longer material to the dispute.  The union respondents reassert their 
mootness argument in their brief on the merits.  Brief for Respondent Unions 18. 
We disagree.  The Commission predicated the analysis in its remand order on the correctness of the Court of Appeals' 
interpretation of § 11341(a).  Thus, our definitive interpretation of § 11341(a) may affect the Commission's remand order.  
Agency compliance with the Court of Appeals' mandate does not moot the issue of the correctness of the court's decision.  See, 
e. g., Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 791, n. 1 (1985); Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, 
453 U.S. 34, 42, n. 12 (1981); Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464, 468-469, n. 4 (1977). In addition, the alternative basis offered by the 
Commission on remand does not end the controversy between the parties.  The parties retain an interest in the validity of the 
499 U.S. 117, *126; 111 S. Ct. 1156, **1162; 113 L. Ed. 2d 95, ***105; 1991 U.S. LEXIS 1709, ****18

 
 [****21]   LEdHN[1D][
] [1D]LEdHN[3][
] [3]As always, we begin with the language of the statute and ask 
whether Congress has spoken on the subject before us.  ""HN8[
] If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end 
of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of 
Congress."" Chevron, 467 U.S., at 842-843. [***107]  The contested language in § 11341(a), exempting carriers 
from ""the antitrust laws and all other law, including State and municipal law,"" is clear, broad, and unqualified.  It 
does not admit of the distinction the Court of Appeals drew, based on its analysis of legislative history, between 
positive enactments and common-law rules of liability.  Nor does it support the Court of Appeals' conclusion that 
Congress did not intend the immunity clause to apply to contractual obligations. 
 [*129]   LEdHN[1E][
] [1E]  [****22]  HN9[
] By itself, the phrase ""all other law"" indicates no limitation.  The 
circumstance that the phrase ""all other law"" is in addition to coverage for ""the antitrust laws"" does not detract from 
this breadth.  There is a canon of statutory construction which, on first impression, might seem to dictate a different 
result.  HN10[
] Under the principle of ejusdem generis, when a general term follows a specific one, the general 
term should be understood as a reference to subjects akin to the one with specific enumeration.  See Arcadia v. 
Ohio Power Co., 498 U.S. 73, 84-85 (1990). The canon does not control, however, when the whole context dictates 
a different conclusion.  Here, there are several reasons the immunity provision cannot be interpreted to apply only 
to antitrust laws and similar statutes.  First, because ""repeals of the antitrust laws by implication from a regulatory 
statute are strongly disfavored,"" United States v. Philadelphia Nat. Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 350 (1963), Congress may 
have determined that it should make a clear and separate statement to include antitrust laws within the general 
exemption of § 11341(a).  Second, the otherwise general [****23]  term ""all other law"" ""includes"" (but is not limited 
to) ""State and municipal law."" This shows that ""all other law"" refers to more than laws related to antitrust. Also, the 
fact that ""all other law"" entails more than ""the antitrust laws,"" but is not limited to ""State and municipal law,"" 
reinforces the conclusion, inherent in the  [**1164]  word ""all,"" that the phrase ""all other law"" includes federal law 
other than the antitrust laws. HN11[
] In short, the immunity provision in § 11341 means what it says: A carrier is 
exempt from all law as necessary to carry out an ICC-approved transaction. 
 LEdHN[1F][
] [1F]LEdHN[4][
] [4]The exemption is broad enough to include laws that govern the obligations 
imposed by contract.  ""The obligation of a contract is 'the law which binds the parties to perform their agreement.'"" 
Home Building & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U.S. 398, 429 (1934) (quoting Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 
122, 197 (1819)). [****24] A contract depends on a regime  [*130]  of common and statutory law for its effectiveness 
and enforcement. 
""Laws which subsist at the time and place of the making of a contract, and where it is to be performed, enter 
into and form a part of it, as fully as if they had been expressly referred to or incorporated in its terms.  This 
principle embraces alike those laws which affect its construction and those which affect its enforcement or 
discharge."" Farmers and Merchants Bank of Monroe v. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, 262 U.S. 649, 660 
(1923). 
 
HN12[
]  [***108]  A contract has no legal force apart from the law that acknowledges its binding character.  As a 
result, the exemption in § 11341(a) from ""all other law"" effects an override of contractual obligations, as necessary 
to carry out an approved transaction, by suspending application of the law that makes the contract binding. 
ICC's original order because the Court of Appeals may again disagree with the Commission's interpretation of the Act in its 
review of the remand order.
499 U.S. 117, *128; 111 S. Ct. 1156, **1163; 113 L. Ed. 2d 95, ***106; 1991 U.S. LEXIS 1709, ****20

 
 Schwabacher v. United States, 334 U.S. 182 (1948), which construed the immediate precursor of § 11341(a), § 
5(11) of the Transportation Act of [****25]  1940, ch. 722, § 7, 54 Stat. 908-909, 4 supports this conclusion.  In 
Schwabacher, minority stockholders in a carrier involved in an ICC-approved merger complained that the terms of 
the merger diminished the value of their shares as guaranteed by the corporate charter  [*131]  and thus ""deprived 
[them] of contract rights under Michigan law. . . ."" 334 U.S., at 188. We explained that the Commission was charged 
under the Act with passing upon and approving all capital liabilities assumed or discharged by the merged 
company, and that once the Commission approved a merger in the public interest and on just and reasonable 
terms, the immunity provision relieved the parties to the merger of ""restraints, limitations, and prohibitions of law, 
Federal, State, or municipal,"" as necessary to carry out the transaction.  Id., at 194-195, 198. We noted that before 
approving the merger, the Commission had a duty ""to see that minority interests are protected,"" and emphasized 
that any such minority rights were, ""as a matter of federal law, accorded recognition in the obligation of the 
Commission not to approve any plan which is not just and reasonable."" Id., at 201. [****26]  Once these interests 
were accounted for, however, ""it would be inconsistent to allow state law to apply a liquidation basis [for valuation] 
to what federal law designates as a basis for continued public service."" Id., at 200. Relying in part on the immunity 
provision, we held the contract  [**1165]  rights protected by state law did not survive the merger agreement found 
by the Commission to be in the public interest. Id., at 194-195, 200-201. Because the Commission had disclaimed 
jurisdiction to settle the shareholders' complaints, we remanded the case to the Commission to ensure that the 
terms of the merger were just and reasonable.  Id., at 202. 
 [****27]  Just as the obligations imposed by state contract law did not survive the merger at issue in Schwabacher, 
the obligations imposed by the law that gives force to the carriers' collective-bargaining agreements, the  [***109]  
RLA, do not survive the merger in this case.  The RLA governs the formation, construction, and enforcement of the 
labor-management contracts in issue here.  It requires carriers and employees to make reasonable efforts ""to make 
and maintain"" collective-bargaining agreements, 45 U. S. C. § 152 First, and to refrain from making changes in 
existing agreements except in  [*132]  accordance with RLA procedures, 45 U. S. C. §§ 152 Seventh, 156.  The Act 
""extends both to disputes concerning the making of collective agreements and to grievances arising under existing 
agreements."" Slocum v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., 339 U.S. 239, 242 (1950). HN13[
] As the law which gives 
""legal and binding effect to collective agreements,"" Detroit & T. S. L. R. Co. v. United Transportation Union, 396 
U.S. 142, 156 (1969), [****28]  the RLA is the law that, under § 11341(a), is superseded when an ICC-approved 
transaction requires abrogation of collective-bargaining obligations.  See ICC v. Locomotive Engineers, 482 U.S. 
270, 287 (1987) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers v. Boston & Maine 
Corp., 788 F. 2d 794, 801 (CA1 1986); Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. United Transportation Union, 782 F. 2d 107, 111 
(CA8 1986); Burlington Northern, Inc. v. American Railway Supervisors Assn., 503 F. 2d 58, 62-63 (CA7 1974); 
Bundy v. Penn Central Co., 455 F. 2d 277, 279-280 (CA6 1972); Nemitz v. Norfolk & Western R. Co., 436 F. 2d 
841, 845 (CA6), aff'd, 404 U.S. 37 (1971); Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers v. Chicago & N. W. R. Co., 314 F. 
2d 424 (CA8 1963); Texas & N. O. R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, 307 F. 2d 151, 161-162 (CA5 
1962); Railway Labor Executives Assn. v. Guilford Transp. Industries, Inc., 667 F. Supp. 29, 35 (Me. 1987), aff'd, 
843 F. 2d 1383 (CA1 1988). [****29]  
Our determination that § 11341(a) supersedes collective-bargaining obligations via the RLA as necessary to carry 
out an ICC-approved transaction makes sense of the consolidation provisions of the Act, which were designed to 
promote ""economy and efficiency in interstate transportation by the removal of the burdens of excessive 
expenditure."" Texas v. United States, 292 U.S. 522, 534-535 (1934). HN14[
] The Act requires the Commission to 
4 Section 5(11) of the Transportation Act of 1940 provided: 
""Any carriers or other corporations, and their officers and employees and any other persons, participating in a transaction 
approved or authorized under the provisions of this section shall be and they are hereby relieved from the operation of the 
antitrust laws and all other restraints, limitations, and prohibitions of law, Federal, State, or municipal, insofar as may be 
necessary to enable them to carry into effect the transaction so approved or provided for in accordance with the terms and 
conditions, if any, imposed by the Commission. . . ."" 
The recodification of this language in § 11341(a) effected no substantive change.  See H. R. Rep. No. 95-1395, pp. 158-160 
(1978).  See also ICC v. Locomotive Engineers, 482 U.S. 270, 299, n. 12 (1987) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).

approve consolidations in the public interest. 49 U. S. C. § 11343(a)(1).  Recognizing that consolidations in the 
public interest will ""result in wholesale dismissals and extensive transfers, involving expense to  [*133]  transferred 
employees"" as well as ""the loss of seniority rights,"" United States v. Lowden, 308 U.S. 225, 233 (1939), the Act 
imposes a number of labor-protecting requirements to ensure that the Commission accommodates the interests of 
affected parties to the greatest extent possible.  49 U. S. C. §§ 11344(b)(1)(D), 11347; see also New York Dock 
Railway -- Control -- Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal, 360 I. C. C. 60 (1979). [****30]  Section 11341(a) 
guarantees that HN15[
] once these interests are accounted for and once the consolidation is approved, 
obligations imposed by laws such as the RLA will not prevent the efficiencies of consolidation from being achieved.  
If § 11341(a) did not apply to bargaining  [***110]  agreements enforceable under the RLA, rail carrier 
consolidations  [**1166]  would be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.  The resolution process for major disputes 
under the RLA would so delay the proposed transfer of operations that any efficiencies the carriers sought would be 
defeated.  See, e. g., Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Maintenance of Way Employes, 481 U.S. 429, 444 (1987) 
(resolution procedures for major disputes ""virtually endless""); Detroit & T. S. L. R. Co. v. United Transportation 
Union, 396 U.S. 142, 149 (1969) (dispute resolution under RLA involves ""an almost interminable process""); Railway 
Clerks v. Florida East Coast R. Co., 384 U.S. 238, 246 (1966) (RLA procedures are ""purposely long and drawn 
out"").  The immunity [****31]  provision of § 11341(a) is designed to avoid this result. 
HN16[
] We hold that, as necessary to carry out a transaction approved by the Commission, the term ""all other 
law"" in § 11341(a) includes any obstacle imposed by law.  In this case, the term ""all other law"" in § 11341(a) applies 
to the substantive and remedial laws respecting enforcement of collective-bargaining agreements.  Our construction 
of the clear statutory command confirms the interpretation of the agency charged with its administration and expert 
in the field of railroad mergers. We affirm the Commission's interpretation of § 11341(a), not out of deference in the 
face of an  [*134]  ambiguous statute, but rather because the Commission's interpretation is the correct one. 
This reading of § 11341(a) will not, as the Court of Appeals feared, lead to bizarre results.  Brotherhood of Railway

] The immunity provision does not exempt 
carriers from [****32]  all law, but rather from all law necessary to carry out an approved transaction.  We reiterate 
that neither the conditions of approval, nor the standard for necessity, is before us today.  It may be, as the 
Commission held on remand from the Court of Appeals, that the scope of the immunity provision is limited by § 
11347, which conditions approval of a transaction on satisfaction of certain labor-protective conditions.  See n. 2, 
supra.  It also might be true that ""the breadth of the exemption [in § 11341(a)] is defined by the scope of the 
approved transaction. . . ."" ICC v. Locomotive Engineers, supra, at 298 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  We 
express no view on these matters, as they are not before us here.

opinion. 
It is so ordered.

Dissent
JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
The statutory exemption that the Court construes today had its source in § 407 of the Transportation Act of 1920 
(1920 Act).  41 Stat. 482.  Its wording was slightly changed in 1940, 54 Stat. 908-909,  [****33]  and again in 1978, 
92 Stat. 1434.  There is, however, no claim that either of those amendments modified the coverage  [***111]  of the 
exemption in any way.  It is therefore appropriate to begin with a consideration of the purpose and the text of the 
1920 Act. 
499 U.S. 117, *132; 111 S. Ct. 1156, **1165; 113 L. Ed. 2d 95, ***109; 1991 U.S. LEXIS 1709, ****29

 
 [*135]  Before the First World War, the railroad industry had been the prime target of antitrust enforcement. 1 In 
1920, however, Congress adopted a new national transportation policy that expressly favored the consolidation of 
railroads. The policy of consolidation embodied in the 1920 Act would obviously  [**1167]  have been frustrated by 
the federal antitrust laws had Congress not chosen to exempt explicitly all approved mergers from these laws.  
Section 407 of that Act provided, in part: 
""The carriers affected by any order made under the foregoing provisions of this section . . . shall be, and they 
are hereby, relieved from the operation of the 'antitrust laws,' . . . and of all other restraints or prohibitions by 
law, State or Federal, in so far as may be necessary to enable them to do anything authorized or required by 
any order made under and pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section."" 41 Stat. 482.
 [****34] 
Both the background and the text of § 407 make it absolutely clear that its primary focus was on federal antitrust 
laws. Sensibly, however, Congress wrote that section using language broad enough to cover any other federal or 
state law that might otherwise forbid the consummation of any approved merger or prevent the immediate operation 
of its properties under a new corporate owner.  Not a word in the statute, or in its legislative history, contains any 
hint that the approval of a [****35]  merger by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) would impair the 
obligations of valid and otherwise enforceable private contracts. 
Given the present plight of our Nation's railroads, it may be wise policy to give the ICC a power akin to, albeit 
greater  [*136]  than, that of a bankruptcy court to approve a trustee's rejection of a debtor's executory private 
contracts. 2 Through nothing short of a tour de force, however, can one find any such power in 49 U. S. C. § 11341, 
or in either of its predecessors.  Obviously, consolidated carriers would find it useful to have the ability to disavow 
disadvantageous long-term leases on obsolete car repair facilities, employment contracts with high salaried 
executives whose services are no longer needed, as well as collective-bargaining agreements that provide costly 
job security to a shrinking work force.  If Congress had intended to give the ICC such broad ranging power to impair 
contracts, it would have done so in language much clearer than anything that can be found in the present Act. 
 [****36]   [***112]  The Court's contrary conclusion rests on its reading of the ""plain meaning"" of the present 
statutory text and our decision in Schwabacher v. United States, 334 U.S. 182 (1948). Neither of these reasons is 
sufficient.  Moreover, the Court's reading is inconsistent with other unambiguous provisions in the statute. 
I 
With or without the ejusdem generis canon, I believe that the normal reader would assume that the text of § 11341 
encompasses the antitrust laws, as well as other federal or state laws, that would otherwise prohibit rail carriers 
from consummating approved mergers, and nothing more.  See ante, at 128.  That text contains no suggestion that 
whenever a criminal law, tort law, or any regulatory measure impedes the efficient operation of a new merged 
carrier, the carrier can avoid such a restriction by virtue of the ICC approval of that merger. Nor does the text of § 
11341 contain any suggestion  [*137]  that such an approval would impair the obligation of private contracts. 3 
1 See United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Assn., 166 U.S. 290 (1897); United States v. Joint Traffic Assn., 171 U.S. 505 
(1898); Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U.S. 197 (1904); United States v. Terminal Railroad Assn. of St. Louis, 224 
U.S. 383 (1912); United States v. Union Pacific R. Co., 226 U.S. 61 (1912); United States v. Pacific & Arctic R. & Nav. Co., 228 
U.S. 87 (1913).
2 Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U. S. C. § 365, allows a trustee to assume or reject a debtor's executory contracts and 
unexpired leases subject to the subsequent approval of the bankruptcy court.  Collective-bargaining agreements can be rejected 
only if the additional requirements of 11 U. S. C. § 1113 are met.
3 As Judge D. H. Ginsburg, writing for the Court of Appeals, noted: 
""We cannot sustain the ICC's position that this provision empowers it to override a [collective-bargaining agreement (CBA)].  
First, and most important, the ICC's position finds no support in the language of the statute.  By its terms, § 11341(a) 
499 U.S. 117, *134; 111 S. Ct. 1156, **1166; 113 L. Ed. 2d 95, ***111; 1991 U.S. LEXIS 1709, ****33

 
Rather, as  [**1168]  both an application of the ejusdem generis canon and an examination of the legislative history 
show, the purpose of the [****37]  exemption was to relieve the carriers ""from the operation of the antitrust and 
other restrictive or prohibitory laws."" H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 650, 66th Cong., 2d Sess., 64 (1920) (emphasis added). 
 [****38]  The Court speculates that the reason the 1920 Congress explicitly referred to the antitrust laws was 
simply to avoid the force of the rule that repeals of the antitrust laws by implication are not favored, citing United 
States v. Philadelphia Nat. Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 350 (1963). In that case, however, the rule was announced in the 
context of the industry's argument that federal regulatory approval of a transaction exempted the transaction from 
the antitrust laws even though the regulatory statute was entirely silent on the subject of exemption. Ibid. The 
authority cited in the Philadelphia  [*138]  decision to support this rule sheds no light on the question whether a 
statute creating a broad exemption for mergers would naturally be read to include all statutes that otherwise would 
have prohibited the consummation  [***113]  of a merger of large rail carriers. 4 
 [****39]  Of greater importance, however, is the Court's rather remarkable assumption that an exemption ""from 'all 
other  [*139]  law'"" should be read to encompass the restraints created  [**1169]  by private contract. 5 [****40]  
contemplates exemption only from 'the antitrust laws and from all other law' to the extent necessary to carry out the transaction.  
Nowhere does it say that the ICC may also override contracts, nor has it ever, in any of the various iterations since its initial 
enactment in 1920, included even a general reference to 'contracts,' much less any specific reference to CBAs.  Nor has the ICC 
explained how we can read the term 'other law,' as it has done, to mean 'all legal obstacles.' Dispatchers, J. A. 207.  None of the 
Supreme Court decisions, discussed below, authorizing the ICC to abrogate an 'other law' even suggests that the term means 
'all legal obstacles.' The ICC itself, prior to its 1983 decision in DRGW, recognized as much.  See Gulf, Mobile & Ohio R. R. Co. -
- Abandonment, 282 I. C. C. 311, 335 (1952) ('None of the decisions in the [Supreme Court] cases . . . relates to private 
contractual rights, but refers [sic] to State laws which prohibit in some way the carrying out of the transaction authorized.')."" 
Brotherhood of Railway Carmen v. ICC, 279 U.S. App. D. C. 239, 244, 880 F. 2d 562, 567 (1989).
4 All but two of the cases that the Court cited in the Philadelphia decision to support the rule against implicit repeals of the 
antitrust statutes arose under a regulatory framework in which there was no mention of exemption. United States v. Philadelphia 
Nat. Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 350, n. 28 (1963). See United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Assn., 166 U.S., at 314-315; United 
States v. Joint Traffic Assn., 171 U.S. 505 (1898); Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U.S., at 343, 374-376 (plurality 
and dissenting opinions); United States v. Pacific & Arctic R. & Nav. Co., 228 U.S., at 105, 107; Keogh v. Chicago & 
Northwestern R. Co., 260 U.S. 156, 161-162 (1922); Central Transfer Co. v. Terminal Railway Assn. of St. Louis, 288 U.S. 469, 
474-475 (1933); Terminal Warehouse Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 297 U.S. 500, 513-515 (1936); United States v. Borden Co., 
308 U.S. 188, 197-206 (1939); United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 226-228 (1940); Georgia v. 
Pennsylvania R. Co., 324 U.S. 439, 456-457 (1945); United States Alkali Export Assn., Inc. v. United States, 325 U.S. 196, 205-
206 (1945); Allen Bradley Co. v. Electrical Workers, 325 U.S. 797, 809-810 (1945); Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 356 
U.S. 1, 9 (1958); United States v. Radio Corp. of America, 358 U.S. 334 (1959); California v. FPC, 369 U.S. 482 (1962); Silver v. 
New York Stock Exchange, 373 U.S. 341 (1963). The other two cases involve regulations with explicit exemptions from the 
antitrust laws, but do not support the position taken by the Court in this case.  In Maryland & Virginia Milk Producers Assn., Inc. 
v. United States, 362 U.S. 458 (1960), this Court held that § 6 of the Clayton Act's exemption of agricultural cooperatives from 
the antitrust law only protected the formation of those associations; once formed they could not engage in any further conduct 
that would violate the antitrust laws. In Pan American World Airways, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 296 (1963), the Court held 
that the exemption relieving airlines from the operation of the antitrust laws when certain transactions were approved by the Civil 
Aeronautics Board did not exempt the airlines from all antitrust violations, but only exempted them from violations stemming from 
activity explicitly governed by the regulatory scheme.
5 Again Judge Ginsburg's observation is pertinent: 
""Moreover, the ICC's proposed insertion of 'all legal obstacles' into the statutory language would lead to most bizarre results.  
Under the ICC's reading, it could set to naught, in order to facilitate a merger, a carrier's solemn undertaking, in a bond indenture 
or a bank loan, to refrain from entering into any such transaction without the consent of its creditors.  Cf.  Gulf, Mobile & Ohio, 
282 I. C. C. at 331-35 (declaring itself without power, in an abandonment context, to relieve a carrier from its 'contractual 
obligations for the payment of rent').  We do not think it likely that Congress would grant the ICC a power with so much potential 
to destabilize the railroad industry; we are confident, however, that it would not do so without so much as a word to that effect in 
the statute itself.  Never, either in its decisions here under review or in prior cases, has the ICC offered any justification for this 
most unlikely reading of the Act."" 279 U.S. App. D. C., at 244-245, 880 F. 2d, at 567-568.
499 U.S. 117, *137; 111 S. Ct. 1156, **1167; 113 L. Ed. 2d 95, ***112; 1991 U.S. LEXIS 1709, ****36

 
Ante, at 129-130.  Even if the text of the present Act could bear that reading, it is flatly inconsistent with the text of 
the 1920 Act, which relieved the participating carriers ""from the operation of the 'antitrust laws' . . . and of all other 
restraints or prohibitions by law, State or federal. . . ."" 41 Stat. 482.  Moreover, given the respect that our legal 
system has always paid to the enforceability of private contracts -- a respect that is evidenced by express language 
in the  [***114]  Constitution itself 6 -- there should be a powerful presumption against finding an implied authority to 
impair contracts in a statute that was enacted to alleviate a legitimate concern about the antitrust laws. Had 
Congress intended to convey the message the Court finds in § 11341, it surely would have said expressly that the 
exemption was from all restraints imposed by law or by private contract. 7 
 [*140]   [****41]  II 
In my opinion, the Court's reliance on the decision in Schwabacher v. United States, 334 U.S. 182 (1948), is 
misplaced.  In that case, the owners of two percent of the outstanding preferred stock of the Pere Marquette 
Railway brought suit in the United States District Court to set aside an ICC order approving a merger between that 
corporation and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Corporation.  In approving the merger, the ICC had found that 
the market value of plaintiffs' preferred shares ranged, at different times, from $ 87 to $ 99 per share, and that the 
stock that they received in exchange pursuant to the merger agreement would have realized about $ 90 and $ 111 
on the same dates.  Thus, the terms of the merger, as applied to the plaintiffs' class, were just and reasonable.  
Plaintiffs contended, however, that the exchange value of their shares amounted to $ 172.50 per share because the 
merger was a ""liquidation"" as a matter of Michigan law, and the Pere Marquette Charter provided that in the event 
of liquidation or dissolution, the preferred shareholders were entitled to receive full payment of par value plus all 
accrued unpaid dividends. 
The ICC order [****42]  approving the merger did not resolve the Michigan law question.  The ICC considered the 
issue too insignificant to affect the validity of the entire transaction, and left the matter for resolution by negotiation 
or later litigation.  On appeal from the  [**1170]  District Court's judgment sustaining the ICC order, this Court held 
that the ICC's finding that the exchange value was just and reasonable foreclosed any other claim that the 
dissenting shareholders might assert  [*141]  concerning the value of their shares.  Whatever Michigan law might 
provide for the preferred shareholders in the event of a winding-up or liquidation could not determine the just and 
reasonable value of shares in the continuing enterprise.  The essence of the Court's holding is set forth in this 
passage: 
""Since the federal law clearly contemplates merger as a step in  [***115]  continuing the enterprise, it follows 
that what Michigan law might give these dissenters on a winding-up or liquidation is irrelevant, except insofar 
as it may be reflected in current values for which they are entitled to an equivalent.  It would be inconsistent to 
allow state law to apply a liquidation basis to what federal [****43]  law designates as a basis for continued 
public service. . . . 
. . . . 
""We therefore hold that no rights alleged to have been granted to dissenting stockholders by state law 
provision concerning liquidation survive the merger agreement approved by the requisite number of 
stockholders and approved by the Commission as just and reasonable.  Any such rights are, as a matter of 
6 ""No State shall . . . pass any . . . Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts. . . ."" U.S. Const., Art. I, § 10, cl. 1.
7 After reviewing the legislative history, Judge Ginsburg concluded: 
""From our review of this history, we are confident that Congress did not intend, when it enacted the immunity provision, to 
override contracts.  First, Congress focused nearly exclusively, in the hearings and debates on the 1920 Act, on specific types of 
laws it intended to eliminate -- all of which were positive enactments, not common law rules of liability, as on a contract.  Cf.  
Association of Flight Attendants v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 879 F. 2d 906, 917 (D. C. Cir. 1989). Indeed, Commissioner Clark, who 
presented the immunity idea to the House and Senate Commerce Committees in the hearings cited above, did not once 
suggest, over the course of several days and several hundred pages, that the proposed immunity might relieve a carrier of its 
obligations under negotiated agreements with third parties."" 279 U.S. App. D. C., at 247, 880 F. 2d, at 570.
499 U.S. 117, *139; 111 S. Ct. 1156, **1169; 113 L. Ed. 2d 95, ***113; 1991 U.S. LEXIS 1709, ****40

 
federal law, accorded recognition in the obligation of the Commission not to approve any plan which is not just 
and reasonable."" Id., at 200-201.
It is true that the effect of the Schwabacher decision was to extinguish whatever contractual rights the dissenting 
shareholders possessed as a matter of Michigan law.  But the Court did require the ICC, on remand, to consider 
whatever value the Michigan law claims might have in connection with its final conclusion that the merger plan was 
""just and reasonable."" A fair reading of the entire opinion makes it clear that the holding was based more on the 
ICC's ""complete control of the capital structure to result from a merger,"" id., at 195, than on the exemption at issue 
in this case.  Schwabacher cannot fairly be read [****44]  as authorizing carriers to renounce private contracts that 
limit the benefits achievable through the merger. 
 [*142]  III 
There is tension between the Court's interpretation of the exemption that is now codified in 49 U. S. C. § 11341(a) 
and the labor-protection conditions set forth in 49 U. S. C. § 11347. The latter section requires an ICC order 
approving a railroad merger to impose conditions that are ""no less protective"" of the employees than those 
established pursuant to the Rail Passenger Service Act, 84 Stat. 1337, as amended, 45 U. S. C. § 565. One of the 
conditions established by the Secretary of Labor under the latter Act was essentially the same as § 2 of the New 
York Dock conditions described by the Court, ante, at 120-121.  As the Court notes, that condition provides that the 
benefits protected ""'under applicable laws and/or existing collective bargaining agreements . . . shall be preserved 
unless changed by future collective bargaining agreements.'"" Id., at 121 (citation omitted).  This provision 
unambiguously indicates that Congress intended and expected that collective-bargaining [****45]  agreements 
would survive any ICC approved merger. 
As I noted in my separate opinion in ICC v. Locomotive Engineers, 482 U.S. 270, 298 (1987), the statutory 
immunity provision in § 11341 is self-executing and becomes effective at the time of the ICC approval.  ""The 
breadth of the exemption is defined by the scope of the approved transaction, and no explicit announcement of 
exemption is required to make the statute applicable."" Ibid.  [***116]  (footnote omitted).  In neither of the cases 
before the Court today did the ICC approval of the merger purport to modify or terminate any collective-bargaining 
agreement.  The ICC approval orders were entered in 1980 and  [**1171]  1982 and contained no mention of either 
of the proposed transfers of personnel that are now at issue and about which the union was first notified several 
years after the ICC orders were entered. 8 
 [****46]   [*143]  I cannot subscribe to a late-blooming interpretation of a 71-year-old immunity statute that gives 
the Commission a roving power -- exercisable years after a merger has been approved and consummated -- to 
impair the obligations of private contracts that may ""prevent the efficiencies of consolidation from being achieved."" 
Ante, at 133.  The Court's decision may represent a ""better"" policy choice than the one Congress actually made in 
1920, cf. West Virginia University Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, ante, at 100-101, but it is neither an accurate reading of 
the command that Congress issued in 1920, nor is it a just disposition of claims based on valid private contracts. 
8 In the ICC order approving the merger of Chessie System, Inc., and Seaboard Coastline Industries, Inc., the ICC discussed 
how the coordination of facilities would generate significant cost reductions and improved economic efficiency.  CSX Corp. -- 
Control -- Chessie System, Inc., and Seaboard Coast Line Industries, Inc., 363 I. C. C. 521, 556 (1980). The ICC noted: 
""These savings will spring from common-point coordination projects, mechanical and engineering department coordinations, 
locomotive and car utilization improvements, and internal rerouting efficiencies.  Each of these projects is discussed separately 
below."" Ibid. 
In the discussion that followed, the ICC did discuss plans to expand the car production facilities at Raceland, Kentucky, in order 
to make cars for a member line that had been buying its cars from an independent manufacturer.  The ICC found that the 
applicants had failed to show that the public would derive any benefit from this plan.  There was no discussion of the 
consolidation of that facility by closing Seaboard's car repair shop in Waycross, Georgia.  Nor did the ICC discuss the 
consolidation of locomotive works in Norfolk Southern Corp. -- Control -- Norfolk & W. R. Co. and Southern R. Co., 366 I. C. C. 
173 (1982).

HN3[
]  Exemptions & Immunities, Parker State Action Doctrine
In order to prevent Parker from undermining the very interests of federalism it is designed to protect, it is necessary 
to adopt a concept of authority broader than what is applied to determine the legality of the municipality's action 
under state law. Courts adopt an approach that is similar in principle, though not necessarily in precise application, 
elsewhere.
Antitrust & Trade Law > Exemptions & Immunities > Parker State Action Doctrine > General Overview
HN4[
]  Exemptions & Immunities, Parker State Action Doctrine
The Parker defense also requires authority to suppress competition, more specifically, ""clear articulation of a state

The rationale of Parker is that, in light of our national commitment to federalism, the general language of the 
Sherman Act should not be interpreted to prohibit anticompetitive actions by the states in their governmental 
capacities as sovereign regulators. The immunity does not necessarily obtain where the state acts not in a 
regulatory capacity but as a commercial participant in a given market.

The approach which would consider Parker inapplicable is only if, in connection with the governmental action in

Courts are to reject any interpretation of the Sherman Act that would allow plaintiffs to look behind the actions of 
state sovereigns to base their claims on perceived conspiracies to restrain trade. With the possible market

The federal antitrust laws also do not regulate the conduct of private individuals in seeking anticompetitive action 
from the government. This doctrine, like Parker, rests ultimately upon a recognition that the antitrust laws, ""tailored 
as they are for the business world, are not at all appropriate for application in the political arena."" That a private 
party's political motives are selfish is irrelevant: Noerr shields from the Sherman Act a concerted effort to influence

Decision
Federal antitrust laws held inapplicable to actions of (1) city which enacted billboard zoning ordinances, and (2) 
company which controlled relevant billboard market and which lobbied for ordinances.  
Summary
In 1981, a Georgia corporation began erecting billboards in and around the city of Columbia, South Carolina. In 
response, a South Carolina corporation--which had been in the billboard business in Columbia since the 1940s, and 
which controlled more than 95 percent of the relevant market in the Columbia area--met with city officials to seek 
the enactment of zoning ordinances that would restrict billboard construction. The South Carolina corporation was 
owned by a family whose members enjoyed close relations with the city's political leaders. In 1982, the city council 
passed an ordinance which imposed a moratorium period on billboard construction in the city, except as specifically 
authorized by the council. After this ordinance was invalidated by a state court on federal and state constitutional 
grounds, the city council passed a new ordinance which restricted the size, location, and spacing of billboards. Two 
months later, the Georgia corporation filed suit in United States District Court against both the South Carolina 
corporation and the city. The Georgia corporation alleged that the city's billboard ordinances (1) violated (a) 1 and 2 
of the Sherman Act (15 USCS 1, 2), and (b) South Carolina's unfair trade practices statute; and (2) were the result 
of an anticompetitive conspiracy between city officials and the South Carolina corporation which stripped both 
parties of any immunity from the federal antitrust laws which they otherwise might have enjoyed. A jury returned 
general verdicts against the city and the South Carolina corporation on both the federal and state claims. The city 
and the South Carolina corporation moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdicts, and the District Court--finding 
that the activities of both parties were outside the scope of the federal antitrust laws--granted the motion. On 
appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (1) reversed the judgment of the District Court, and 
(2) reinstated the jury verdicts on all counts (891 F2d 1127).
On certiorari, the United States Supreme Court reversed and remanded. In an opinion by Scalia, J., joined by 
Rehnquist, Ch. J., and Blackmun, O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ., it was held that (1) the ordinance restricting 
the size, location, and spacing of billboards was entitled to immunity from the federal antitrust laws, where state 
statutes (a) authorized the city, through the exercise of its zoning power, to regulate the size, location, and spacing 
of billboards, and (b) clearly articulated a state policy to authorize the city's anticompetitive conduct in connection 
with its regulation; (2) there was no ""conspiracy"" exception to the rule, under Parker v Brown (1943) 317 US 341, 87 
L Ed 315, 63 S Ct 307, that the Sherman Act did not apply to anticompetitive restraints imposed by the states as an 
act of government, and any governmental action that qualified as state action--with the possible exception of 
instances where the state acts not in a regulatory capacity, but as a commercial participant in a given market--was 
ipso facto exempt from the operation of the federal antitrust laws; (3) the ""sham"" exception to the rule, under 
Eastern R. Presidents Conference v Noerr Motor Freight, Inc. (1961) 365 US 127, 5 L Ed 2d 464, 81 S Ct 523, that 
the federal antitrust laws do not regulate the conduct of private individuals in seeking anticompetitive action from 
state governments--which exception applies to situations in which persons use the governmental process, as 
opposed to the outcome of that process, as an anticompetitive weapon--was inapplicable to the South Carolina 
corporation under the circumstances; (4) there was no ""conspiracy"" exception to the Noerr rule; and (5) the 
Supreme Court would remand the case for further proceedings, so that the Court of Appeals could determine (a) 
whether there should be a new trial with respect to only the private anticompetitive actions allegedly engaged in by 
the corporation, and (b) the effect of the Supreme Court's holding on the claim under the South Carolina unfair 
trade practices statute.
Stevens, J., joined by White and Marshall, JJ., dissenting, (1) agreed that (a) there was no ""conspiracy"" exception 
to the Parker rule when a state acted in a nonproprietary capacity, and (b) the ""sham"" exception to the Noerr rule 
did not apply to the South Carolina corporation's conduct in the case at hand; but (2) expressed the view that the 
Court of Appeals' judgment should be affirmed as to both the city and the South Carolina corporation, because (a) 
499 U.S. 365, *365; 111 S. Ct. 1344, **1344; 113 L. Ed. 2d 382, ***382; 1991 U.S. LEXIS 1858, ****1

 
the city's economic regulation of the billboard market pursuant to a general state grant of zoning power was not 
exempt from antitrust scrutiny, and (b) a private party's agreement with selfishly motivated public officials was 
sufficient to remove the antitrust immunity that protected private lobbying under the Noerr rule.

corporation had set out to disrupt the competitor's business relationships not through the very process of lobbying,

product of that lobbying and consideration, (2) the delay in the competitor's entry into the market was not sought to

For purposes of determining whether a municipality has acted beyond its delegated authority under state law, so as

broader than what is applied to determine the legality of the municipality's action under state law.

In order for a municipality to assert its immunity from application of the federal antitrust laws with respect to 
regulation by the municipality, there must be (1) authority to regulate under state law--although the municipality 
need not be able to point to a specific, detailed legislative authorization--and (2) authority to suppress competition, 
which requires clear articulation of a state policy to authorize anticompetitive conduct by the municipality in 
connection with its regulation; a state statute delegating authority to suppress competition need not explicitly permit 
the displacement of competition, and it is enough if such suppression is the foreseeable result of what the statute 
authorizes.

setting of artificially low rates, and inducement to breach of contract--allegedly engaged in by the corporation; and

On appellate review, a jury's general verdict against a private corporation and in favor of its competitor, based on 
instructions that erroneously permitted the assessment of liability against the corporation, under the federal antitrust 
laws, for seeking the enactment by a municipality of certain billboard ordinances, cannot be permitted to stand; 
however, the competitor will be entitled to a new trial if (1) the evidence was sufficient to sustain a verdict solely on 
the basis of the corporation's private anticompetitive actions--such as trade libel, the setting of artificially low rates, 
and inducement to breach of contract--and (2) the theory of liability as to such other actions has been properly 
preserved.  
Syllabus
After respondent Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., entered the billboard market in petitioner Columbia, South 
Carolina, petitioner Columbia Outdoor Advertising, Inc. (COA), which controlled more than 95% of the market and 
enjoyed close relations with city officials, lobbied these officials to enact zoning ordinances restricting billboard 
construction.  After such ordinances were passed, Omni filed suit against petitioners under §§ 1 and 2 of the 
Sherman Act and the State's Unfair Trade Practices Act, alleging, inter alia, that the ordinances were the result of 
an anticompetitive conspiracy that stripped petitioners of any immunity to which they might otherwise be entitled.  
After Omni obtained a jury verdict on all counts, the District [****2]  Court granted petitioners' motions for judgment 
notwithstanding the verdict on the ground that their activities were outside the scope of the federal antitrust laws. 
The Court of Appeals reversed and reinstated the verdict. 
Held: 
1.  The city's restriction of billboard construction is immune from federal antitrust liability under Parker v. Brown, 317 
U.S. 341, 352 -- which held that principles of federalism and state sovereignty render the Sherman Act inapplicable 
to anticompetitive restraints imposed by the States ""as an act of government"" -- and subsequent decisions 
499 U.S. 365, *365; 111 S. Ct. 1344, **1344; 113 L. Ed. 2d 382, ***382; 1991 U.S. LEXIS 1858, ****1

 
according Parker immunity to municipal restriction of competition in implementation of state policy, see, e. g., Hallie 
v. Eau Claire, 471 U.S. 34, 38. Pp. 370-379. 
(a) The Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the city was prima facie entitled to Parker immunity for its 
billboard restrictions.  Although Parker immunity does not apply directly to municipalities or other political 
subdivisions of the States, it does apply where a municipality's restriction of competition is an authorized 
implementation of state policy. South Carolina's zoning statutes [****3]  unquestionably authorized the city to 
regulate the size, location, and spacing of billboards. The additional Parker requirement that the city possess clear 
delegated authority to suppress competition, see, e. g., Hallie, supra, at 40-42, is also met here, since suppression 
of competition is at the very least a foreseeable result of zoning regulations. Pp. 370-373. 
(b) The Court of Appeals erred, however, in applying a ""conspiracy"" exception to Parker, which is not supported by 
the language of that case.  Such an exception would swallow up the Parker rule if ""conspiracy"" means nothing more 
than agreement to impose the regulation in question, since it is both inevitable and desirable that public officials 
agree to do what one or another group of private citizens urges upon them.  It would be similarly impractical to limit 
""conspiracy"" to instances of governmental ""corruption,"" or governmental acts ""not in the public interest""; virtually all 
anticompetitive regulation is open to such charges and the risk of unfavorable ex post facto judicial assessment 
would impair the States' ability to regulate their domestic commerce.  Nor is it appropriate to limit [****4]  
""conspiracy"" to instances in which bribery or some other violation of state or federal law has been established, since 
the exception would then be unrelated to the purposes of the Sherman Act, which condemns trade restraints, not 
political activity.  With the possible exception of the situation in which the State is acting as a market participant, any 
action that qualifies as state action is ipso facto exempt from the operation of the antitrust laws. Pp. 374-379. 
2.  COA is immune from liability for its activities relating to enactment of the ordinances under Eastern Railroad 
Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 141, which states a corollary to Parker: The 
federal antitrust laws do not regulate the conduct of private individuals in seeking anticompetitive action from the 
government.  The Court of Appeals erred in applying the ""sham"" exception to the Noerr doctrine.  This exception 
encompasses situations in which persons use the governmental process itself -- as opposed to the outcome of that 
process -- as an anticompetitive weapon.  That is not the situation here.  California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking 
Unlimted, 404 U.S. 508, 512, [****5]  distinguished.  Omni's suggestion that this Court adopt a ""conspiracy"" 
exception to Noerr immunity is rejected for largely the same reasons that prompt the Court to reject such an 
exception to Parker.  Pp. 379-384. 
3.  The Court of Appeals on remand must determine (if the theory has been properly preserved) whether the 
evidence was sufficient to sustain a verdict for Omni based solely on its assertions that COA engaged in private 
anticompetitive actions, and whether COA can be held liable to Omni on its state-law claim.  P. 384.
