                  In this antitrust case, the plaintiffs challenged the National Football League’s contract with DirecTV for the television
                  rights to out-of-market games. That contract has been in place for 26 years. The District Court dismissed the
                  plaintiffs’ suit. But the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the plaintiffs’ complaint sufficiently alleged that the
                  contract may be illegal under the antitrust laws. Ordinarily, a decision of such legal and economic significance might
                  warrant this Court’s review. But the case  [*57]  comes to us at the motion-to-dismiss stage, and the interlocutory
                  posture is a factor counseling against this Court’s review at this time. See Abbott v. Veasey, 580 U. S. ___, ___,
                  137 S. Ct. 612, 197 L. Ed. 2d 78, 79 (2017) (Roberts, C. J., statement respecting denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 2).
                  I write separately simply to explain that the denial of certiorari should not  [**292]  necessarily be viewed as
                  agreement [***2]  with the legal analysis of the Court of Appeals.
                  Under the existing contract, the 32 NFL teams have authorized the NFL to sell the television rights for out-of-market
                  games to a single buyer, DirecTV. The plaintiffs argue, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that antitrust law may
                  require each team to negotiate an individualized contract for televising only its own games. But that conclusion
                  appears to be in substantial tension with antitrust principles and precedents. The NFL and its member teams
                  operate as a joint venture. See Smith v. Pro Football, Inc., 593 F. 2d 1173, 1179, 193 U.S. App. D.C. 19 (CADC
                  1978). And antitrust law likely does not require that the NFL and its member teams compete against each other
                  with respect to television rights. Cf. American Needle, Inc. v. National Football League, 560 U. S. 183, 202, 130 S.
                  Ct. 2201, 176 L. Ed. 2d 947 (2010) (“NFL teams . . . must cooperate in the production and scheduling of games”);
                  R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 278 (1978).
                  Moreover, the plaintiffs may not have antitrust standing to sue the NFL and the individual teams. This Court’s case
                  law “authorizes suits by direct purchasers but bars suits by indirect purchasers.” Apple Inc. v. Pepper, 587 U. S.
                  ___, ___, 139 S. Ct. 1514, 203 L. Ed. 2d 802, 809 (2019). The plaintiffs here did not purchase a product from the
                  NFL or any team, and may therefore be barred from bringing suit against the NFL and its teams under Illinois Brick
                  Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977).
                  In sum, the defendants—the NFL, its teams, and [***3]  DirecTV—have substantial arguments on the law. If the
                  defendants do not prevail at summary judgment or at trial, they may raise those legal arguments again in a new
                  petition for certiorari, as appropriate.

                  ]  Per Se Rule & Rule of Reason, Sherman Act
                  In view of the common law and the law in this country when the Sherman Act was passed, the phrase ""restraint of
                  trade"" is best read to mean undue restraint. Determining whether a restraint is undue for purposes of the Sherman
                  Act presumptively calls for what the United States Supreme Court has described as a rule of reason analysis. That
                  manner of analysis generally requires a court to conduct a fact-specific assessment of market power and market
                  structure to assess a challenged restraint’s actual effect on competition. Always, the goal is to distinguish between
                  * Together with No. 20-520, American Athletic Conference et al. v. Alston et al., also on certiorari to the same court.
                  
                  
                  restraints with anticompetitive effect that are harmful to the consumer and restraints stimulating competition that are

                  of reason, which the United States Supreme Court has described as a fact-specific assessment of market power

                  For purposes of the Sherman Act, at one end of the competitive spectrum, some restraints may be so obviously
                  incapable of harming competition that they require little scrutiny. If the exercise of market power is not plausible, the
                  challenged practice is legal. Unless firms have the power to raise price by curtailing output, their agreement is
                  unlikely to harm consumers, and it makes sense to understand their cooperation as benign or beneficial. At the
                  other end of the competitive spectrum, some agreements among competitors so obviously threaten to reduce

                  The orderly way to temper the Sherman Act’s policy of competition is by legislation and not by court decision. A
                  party is free to argue that, because of the special characteristics of its particular industry, it should be exempt from
                  the usual operation of the antitrust laws—but that appeal is properly addressed to Congress. Nor has Congress
                  been insensitive to such requests. It has modified the antitrust laws for certain industries in the past, and it may do
                  so again in the future. But until Congress says otherwise, the only law it has asked courts to enforce is the Sherman
                  Act, and that law is predicated on one assumption alone—competition is the best method of allocating resources in
                  the Nation’s economy.

                  When describing the rule of reason, the United States Supreme Court has sometimes spoken of a three-step,
                  burden-shifting framework as a means for distinguishing between restraints with anticompetitive effect that are
                  harmful to the consumer and restraints stimulating competition that are in the consumer’s best interest. The plaintiff
                  has the initial burden to prove that the challenged restraint has a substantial anticompetitive effect. Should the
                  plaintiff carry that burden, the burden then shifts to the defendant to show a procompetitive rationale for the
                  restraint. If the defendant can make that showing, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the
                  procompetitive efficiencies could be reasonably achieved through less anticompetitive means. These three steps do
                  not represent a rote checklist, nor may they be employed as an inflexible substitute for careful analysis. What is
                  required to assess whether a challenged restraint harms competition can vary depending on the circumstances.

                  The whole point of the rule of reason is to furnish an enquiry meet for the case, looking to the circumstances,
                  details, and logic of a restraint to ensure that it unduly harms competition before a court declares it unlawful. The
                  factfinder weighs all of the circumstances of a case in deciding whether a restrictive practice should be prohibited
                  as imposing an unreasonable restraint on competition.

                  Antitrust law does not require businesses to use anything like the least restrictive means of achieving legitimate

                  lawfulness of conduct turns upon judgments of degrees of efficiency.

                  under the best of circumstances, applying the antitrust laws can be difficult—and mistaken condemnations of
                  legitimate business arrangements are especially costly, because they chill the very procompetitive conduct the
                  antitrust laws are designed to protect. Indeed, static judicial decrees in ever-evolving markets may themselves
                  facilitate collusion or frustrate entry and competition. To know that the Sherman Act prohibits only unreasonable
                  restraints of trade is thus to know that attempts to meter small deviations is not an appropriate antitrust function.

                  Antitrust courts must give wide berth to business judgments before finding liability. Judges must be sensitive to the
                  possibility that the continuing supervision of a highly detailed decree could wind up impairing rather than enhancing
                  competition. Costs associated with ensuring compliance with judicial decrees may exceed efficiencies gained; the
                  decrees themselves may unintentionally suppress procompetitive innovation and even facilitate collusion. Judges
                  must be wary, too, of the temptation to specify the proper price, quantity, and other terms of dealing—cognizant that
                  they are neither economic nor industry experts. Judges must be open to reconsideration and modification of
                  decrees in light of changing market realities, for what they see may vary over time. And throughout courts must
                  have a healthy respect for the practical limits of judicial administration: An antitrust court is unlikely to be an
                  effective day-to-day enforcer of a detailed decree, able to keep pace with changing market dynamics alongside a
                  busy docket. Nor should any court impose a duty that it cannot explain or adequately and reasonably supervise. In
                  short, judges make for poor central planners and should never aspire to the role.

                  mindful, too, of their limitations—as generalists, as lawyers, and as outsiders trying to understand intricate business
                  relationships. Judges must remain aware that markets are often more effective than the heavy hand of judicial
                  power when it comes to enhancing consumer welfare. And judges must be open to clarifying and reconsidering
                  their decrees in light of changing market realities. Courts reviewing complex business arrangements should, in

                  violated Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.S. § 1, by limiting education-related benefits schools could offer student-athletes;
                  restraints were found to be stricter than necessary to achieve demonstrated procompetitive benefits.

                  student-athletes, such as rules limiting scholarships for graduate or vocational school, payments for academic
                  tutoring, or paid posteligibility internships. The district court properly applied a rule of reason analysis and nowhere
                  required the NCAA to show that its compensation rules constituted the least restrictive means of preserving
                  consumer demand, and it was only after finding that the restraints were stricter than necessary to achieve
                  demonstrated procompetitive benefits that the district court declared a violation of the Sherman Act.

                  trade” is best read to mean undue restraint. Determining whether a restraint is undue for purposes of the Sherman
                  Act presumptively calls for what the United States Supreme Court has described as a rule of reason analysis. That
                  manner of analysis generally requires a court to conduct a fact-specific assessment of market power and market

                  restraints with anticompetitive effect that are harmful to the consumer and restraints stimulating competition that are

                  realities change, so may the legal analysis.

                  The orderly way to temper the Sherman Act's policy of competition is by legislation and not by court decision. A
                  party is free to argue that, because of the special characteristics of its particular industry, it should be exempt from
                  the usual operation of the antitrust laws—but that appeal is properly addressed to Congress. Nor has Congress
                  been insensitive to such requests. It has modified the antitrust laws for certain industries in the past, and it may do
                  so again in the future. But until Congress says otherwise, the only law it has asked courts to enforce is the Sherman
                  Act, and that law is predicated on one assumption alone—competition is the best method of allocating resources in
                  the Nation's economy.

                  ]  9.
                  When describing the rule of reason, the United States Supreme Court has sometimes spoken of a three-step,
                  burden-shifting framework as a means for distinguishing between restraints with anticompetitive effect that are
                  harmful to the consumer and restraints stimulating competition that are in the consumer's best interest. The plaintiff
                  has the initial burden to prove that the challenged restraint has a substantial anticompetitive effect. Should the
                  plaintiff carry that burden, the burden then shifts to the defendant to show a procompetitive rationale for the
                  restraint. If the defendant can make that showing, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the
                  procompetitive efficiencies could be reasonably achieved through less anticompetitive means. These three steps do
                  not represent a rote checklist, nor may they be employed as an inflexible substitute for careful analysis.  What is
                  required to assess whether a challenged restraint harms competition can vary depending on the circumstances.

                  The whole point of the rule of reason is to furnish an enquiry meet for the case, looking to the circumstances,
                  details, and logic of a restraint to ensure that it unduly harms competition before a court declares it unlawful. The
                  factfinder weighs all of the circumstances of a case in deciding whether a restrictive practice should be prohibited
                  as imposing an unreasonable restraint on competition.

                  Antitrust law does not require businesses to use anything like the least restrictive means of achieving legitimate
                  business purposes. To the contrary, courts should not second-guess degrees of reasonable necessity so that the
                  lawfulness of conduct turns upon judgments of degrees of efficiency.

                  Rules that seek to embody every economic complexity and qualification may well, through the vagaries of
                  administration, prove counter-productive, undercutting the very economic ends they seek to serve. After all, even
                  under the best of circumstances, applying the antitrust laws can be difficult—and mistaken condemnations of
                  legitimate business arrangements are especially costly, because they chill the very procompetitive conduct the
                  antitrust laws are designed to protect. Indeed, static judicial decrees in ever-evolving markets may themselves
                  facilitate collusion or frustrate entry and competition. To know that the Sherman Act prohibits only unreasonable
                  restraints of trade is thus to know that attempts to meter small deviations is not an appropriate antitrust function.

                  However framed and at whichever step, anticompetitive restraints of trade may wind up flunking the rule of reason
                  to the extent the evidence shows that substantially less restrictive means exist to achieve any proven
                  procompetitive benefits. To be sure, the two questions can be collapsed into one, since a legitimate objective that is
                  not promoted by the challenged restraint can be equally served by simply abandoning the restraint, which is surely
                  a less restrictive alternative.

                  relabel a restraint as a product feature and declare it immune from Sherman Act §1, 15 U.S.C.S. § 1, scrutiny. In
                  any suit, the district court has to determine whether the defendants' agreements harmed competition and whether

                  Antitrust courts must give wide berth to business judgments before finding liability. Judges must be sensitive to the
                  possibility that the continuing supervision of a highly detailed decree could wind up impairing rather than enhancing
                  competition. Costs associated with ensuring compliance with judicial decrees may exceed efficiencies gained; the
                  decrees themselves may unintentionally suppress procompetitive innovation and even facilitate collusion. Judges
                  must be wary, too, of the temptation to specify the proper price, quantity, and other terms of dealing—cognizant that
                  they are neither economic nor industry experts. Judges must be open to reconsideration and modification of
                  decrees in light of changing market realities, for what they see may vary over time. And throughout courts must
                  have a healthy respect for the practical limits of judicial administration: An antitrust court is unlikely to be an
                  effective day-to-day enforcer of a detailed decree, able to keep pace with changing market dynamics alongside a
                  busy docket. Nor should any court impose a duty that it cannot explain or adequately and reasonably supervise. In
                  short, judges make for poor central planners and should never aspire to the role.

                  When it comes to fashioning an antitrust remedy, caution is key. Judges must resist the temptation to require that
                  enterprises employ the least restrictive means of achieving their legitimate business objectives. Judges must be
                  mindful, too, of their limitations—as generalists, as lawyers, and as outsiders trying to understand intricate business
                  relationships. Judges must remain aware that markets are often more effective than the heavy hand of judicial
                  power when it comes to enhancing consumer welfare. And judges must be open to clarifying and reconsidering
                  their decrees in light of changing market realities. Courts reviewing complex business arrangements should, in
                  other words, be wary about invitations to set sail on a sea of doubt.
                  Syllabus
                  [**319]  Colleges and universities across the country have leveraged sports to bring in revenue, attract attention,
                  boost enrollment, and raise money from alumni. That profitable enterprise relies on “amateur” student-athletes who
                  compete under horizontal restraints that restrict how the schools may compensate them for their play. The National
                  Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) issues and enforces these rules, which restrict compensation for student-
                  athletes in various ways. These rules depress compensation for at least some student-athletes below what a
                  competitive market would yield.
                  Against this backdrop, current and former student-athletes brought this antitrust lawsuit challenging the NCAA's
                  restrictions on compensation. Specifically, they alleged that the NCAA's rules violate § 1 of the Sherman Act, which
                  prohibits “contract[s], combination[s], or conspirac[ies] in restraint of trade or commerce.” 15 U. S. C. § 1. Key facts
                  were undisputed: The NCAA and its members have agreed to compensation limits for student-athletes; the NCAA
                  enforces these limits on its member-schools; and these compensation limits affect interstate commerce. [***2]
                  Following a bench trial, the district court issued a 50-page opinion that refused to disturb the NCAA's rules limiting
                  undergraduate athletic scholarships and other compensation related to athletic performance. At the same time, the
                  court found unlawful and thus enjoined certain NCAA rules limiting the education-related benefits schools may
                  make available to student-athletes. Both sides appealed. The Ninth Circuit affirmed in full, holding that the district
                  court “struck the right balance in crafting a remedy that both prevents anticompetitive harm to Student-Athletes
                  while serving the procompetitive purpose of preserving the popularity of college sports.” 958 F. 3d 1239, 1263.
                  Unsatisfied with that result, the NCAA asks the Court to find that all of its existing restraints on athlete
                  compensation survive antitrust scrutiny. The student-athletes have not renewed their across-the-board challenge
                  141 S. Ct. 2141, *2141; 210 L. Ed. 2d 314, **318; 2021 U.S. LEXIS 3123, ***1
                  
                  
                  and the Court thus does not consider the  [**320]  rules that remain in place. The Court considers only the subset of
                  NCAA rules restricting education-related benefits that the district court enjoined. The Court does so based on the
                  uncontested premise that the NCAA enjoys monopsony control in the relevant market—such that [***3]  it is
                  capable of depressing wages below competitive levels for student-athletes and thereby restricting the quantity of
                  student-athlete labor.

                  (a) The courts below properly subjected the NCAA's compensation restrictions to antitrust scrutiny under a “rule of
                  reason” analysis. In the Sherman Act, Congress tasked courts with enforcing an antitrust policy of competition on
                  the theory that market forces “yield the best allocation” of the Nation's resources. National Collegiate Athletic Assn.
                  v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468 U. S. 85, 104, n. 27, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70. The Sherman
                  Act's prohibition on restraints of trade has long been understood to prohibit only restraints that are “undue.” Ohio v.
                  American Express Co., 585 U. S. ___, ___, 138 S. Ct. 2274, 201 L. Ed. 2d 678. Whether a particular restraint is
                  undue “presumptively” turns on an application of a “rule of reason analysis.” Texaco, Inc. v. Dagher, 547 U. S. 1, 5,
                  126 S. Ct. 1276, 164 L. Ed. 2d 1. That manner of analysis generally requires a court to “conduct a fact-specific
                  assessment of market power and market structure” to assess a challenged restraint's “actual effect on competition.”

                  (1) The NCAA maintains the courts below should have analyzed its compensation restrictions under an extremely
                  deferential standard because it is a joint venture among members who must collaborate [***4]  to offer consumers
                  the unique product of intercollegiate athletic competition. Even assuming the NCAA is a joint venture, though, it is a
                  joint venture with monopoly power in the relevant market. Its restraints are appropriately subject to the ordinary rule
                  of reason's fact-specific assessment of their effect on competition. American Express, 585 U. S., at ___, 138 S. Ct.
                  2274, 201 L. Ed. 2d 678. Circumstances sometimes allow a court to determine the anticompetitive effects of a
                  challenged restraint (or lack thereof) under an abbreviated or “quick look.” See Dagher, 547 U. S., at 7, n. 3, 126 S.

                  (2) The NCAA next contends that the Court's decision in Board of Regents expressly approved the NCAA's limits on
                  student-athlete compensation. That is incorrect. The Court in Board of Regents did not analyze the lawfulness of
                  the NCAA's restrictions on student-athlete compensation. Rather, that case involved an antitrust challenge to the
                  NCAA's restraints on televising games—an antitrust challenge the Court sustained. Along the way, the Court
                  commented on the NCAA's critical role in maintaining the revered tradition of amateurism in college sports as one
                  “entirely  [**321]  consistent with the goals of the Sherman Act.” Id., at 120, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70. But
                  that sort of passing comment on an issue not [***5]  presented is not binding, nor is it dispositive here. Pp. ___ -

                  (3) The NCAA also submits that a rule of reason analysis is inappropriate because its member schools are not
                  “commercial enterprises” but rather institutions that exist to further the societally important noncommercial objective
                  of undergraduate education. This submission also fails. The Court has regularly refused these sorts of special
                  dispensations from the Sherman Act. See FTC v. Superior Court Trial Lawyers Assn., 493 U. S. 411, 424, 110 S.
                  Ct. 768, 107 L. Ed. 2d 851. The Court has also previously subjected the NCAA to the Sherman Act, and any
                  argument that “the special characteristics of [the NCAA's] particular industry” should exempt it from the usual
                  operation of the antitrust laws is “properly addressed to Congress.” National Soc. of Professional Engineers v.
                  United States, 435 U. S. 679, 689, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637. Pp. ___ - ___, 210 L. Ed. 2d, at ___ - ___.

                  (1) The NCAA contends that the district court erroneously required it to prove that its rules are the least restrictive
                  means of achieving the procompetitive purpose of preserving consumer demand for college sports. True, a least
                  restrictive means test would be erroneous and overly intrusive. But the district court nowhere expressly or
                  effectively required the NCAA to show that its rules met that standard. [***6]  Rather, only after finding the NCAA's
                  restraints “patently and inexplicably stricter than is necessary” did the district court find the restraints unlawful. Pp.
                  ___ - ___, 210 L. Ed. 2d, at ___ - ___.
                  (2) The NCAA contends the district court should have deferred to its conception of amateurism instead of
                  “impermissibly redefin[ing]” its “product.” But a party cannot declare a restraint “immune from § 1 scrutiny” by
                  relabeling it a product feature. American Needle, Inc. v. National Football League, 560 U. S. 183, 199, n. 7, 130 S.
                  Ct. 2201, 176 L. Ed. 2d 947. Moreover, the district court found the NCAA had not even maintained a consistent
                  definition of amateurism. Pp. ___ - ___, 210 L. Ed. 2d, at ___ - ___.
                  (3) The NCAA disagrees that it can achieve the same pro-competitive benefits using substantially less restrictive
                  alternatives and claims the district court's injunction will “micromanage” its business. Judges must indeed be
                  sensitive to the possibility that the “continuing supervision of a highly detailed decree” could wind up impairing
                  rather than enhancing competition. Verizon Communications Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 540 U. S.
                  398, 415, 124 S. Ct. 872, 157 L. Ed. 2d 823. The district court's injunction honored these principles, though. The
                  court enjoined only certain restraints—and only after finding both that relaxing these restrictions would not blur the
                  distinction between college and professional sports and thus impair demand, and further that this [***7]  course
                  represented a significantly (not marginally) less restrictive means of achieving the same procompetitive  [**322]
                  benefits as the NCAA's current rules. Finally, the court's injunction preserves considerable leeway for the NCAA,
                  while individual conferences remain free to impose whatever rules they choose. To the extent the NCAA believes
                  meaningful ambiguity exists about the scope of its authority, it may seek clarification from the district court. Pp. ___
